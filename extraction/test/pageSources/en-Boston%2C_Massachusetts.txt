==History==
{{main|History of Boston, Massachusetts}}
[[Image:Boston 1772.gif|left|thumb|Boston in 1772.]]
Boston was founded on September 17, 1630 by [[Puritan]] colonists from England.<ref name="history" /> The Puritans of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] are sometimes confused with the [[Pilgrims]] who founded [[Plymouth Colony]] ten years earlier in what is today [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]], [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]], and [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts]]. The two groups are historically distinct and differed in religious practice. The separate colonies were not united until the formation of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in 1691.

The Shawmut peninsula was connected to the mainland by a narrow [[isthmus]], and surrounded by the waters of [[Massachusetts Bay]] and the Back Bay, an [[estuary]] of the [[Charles River]]. Several prehistoric [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] archaeological sites excavated in the city have shown that the peninsula was inhabited as early as 5,000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sec.state.ma.us/mhc/mhcexh/exhidx.htm |title=Archaeology of the Central Artery Project: Highway to the Past |publisher=Commonwealth Museum—Massachusetts Historical Commission |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> Boston's early European settlers first called the area ''Trimountaine'', but later [[English place names in the United States#Massachusetts|renamed the town after]] [[Boston, Lincolnshire]], England, from which several prominent colonists had emigrated. [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]'s original governor, [[John Winthrop]], gave a famous sermon entitled "[[City upon a Hill|A Model of Christian Charity]]," popularly known as the "City on a Hill" sermon, which captured the idea that Boston had a special covenant with God. (Winthrop also led the signing of the [[Cambridge Agreement]], which is regarded as a key founding document of the city.) Puritan ethics molded a stable and well-structured society in Boston. For example, shortly after Boston's settlement, Puritans founded America's first public school, [[Boston Latin School]] (1635),<ref name="BPS" /> and America's first college, [[Harvard College]] (1636). Boston was the largest town in British North America until the mid-1700s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonhistorycollaborative.org/pdf/Era2.pdf |title="Growth" to Boston in its Heyday, 1640’s to 1730’s |format=PDF |publisher=Boston History & Innovation Collaborative |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref>

In the 1770s, British attempts to exert more stringent control on the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]], primarily via taxation, prompted Bostonians to initiate the [[American Revolution]].<ref name="history" /> The [[Boston Massacre]], the [[Boston Tea Party]], and several early battles occurred in or near the city, including the [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]], [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], and the [[Siege of Boston]]. During this period, [[Paul Revere]] made his famous midnight ride.

[[Image:Boston-view-1841-Havell.jpeg|thumb|View of Boston from [[Dorchester Heights]], 1841.]]
After the Revolution, Boston had become one of the world's wealthiest international trading ports due to the city's consolidated seafaring tradition – exports included rum, fish, salt, and tobacco. During this era, descendants of old Boston families became regarded as the nation's social and cultural elites; they were later dubbed the ''[[Boston Brahmins]]''. In 1822, Boston was chartered as a city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/visitors/about.asp |title=About Boston |publisher=City of Boston |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref>

The [[Embargo Act of 1807]], adopted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the [[War of 1812]] significantly curtailed Boston's harbor activity. Although foreign trade returned after these hostilities, Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy and by the mid-1800s, the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance. Until the early 1900s, Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers, and was notable for its [[Clothing|garment]] production and [[leather]] goods industries.<ref name="economy" /> A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region made for easy shipment of goods and allowed for a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads facilitated the region's industry and commerce. From the mid- to late nineteenth century, Boston flourished culturally; it became renowned for its rarefied literary culture and lavish artistic patronage. It also became a center of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/boaf/ |title=Boston African American National Historic Site |date=April 28, 2007 |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> The city reacted strongly to the [[Fugitive Slave Law]], which contributed to President [[Franklin Pierce]]'s attempt to make an example of Boston after the [[Burns Fugitive Slave Case]].

[[Image:Scollay1880s.jpg|thumb|[[Scollay Square]] in the 1880s]]
In the 1820s, Boston's population began to swell and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]]. Irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period. By 1850, about 35,000 [[Irish people|Irish]] lived in Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/murder/peopleevents/p_immigrants.html |title=People & Events: Boston's Immigrant Population |year=2003 |publisher=WGBH/PBS Online (American Experience) |accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[French Canadian]]s, and [[Jews in Russia|Russian]] and [[Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] settle in the city. By the end of the nineteenth century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants – Italians inhabited the [[North End, Boston, Massachusetts|North End]], the Irish dominated [[South Boston]], and Russian Jews lived in the [[West End, Boston, Massachusetts|West End]].

[[Irish American|Irish]] and [[Italian American|Italian]] immigrants brought with them [[Roman Catholicism]]. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Boston-People.html |title=Boston People |year=2007 |publisher=city-data.com |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> and since the early twentieth century the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics—prominent figures include the [[Kennedy family|Kennedys]], [[Tip O'Neill]], and [[John F. Fitzgerald]].

[[Image:USA 09532 Boston Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Trinity Church, Boston|Trinity Church]] reflected in the façade of the John Hancock Tower.]]
Between 1630 and 1890, the city tripled its physical size by [[land reclamation]], by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iboston.org/rg/backbayImap.htm |title=The History of Land Fill in Boston |publisher=iBoston.org |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-01-09}}.

The largest reclamation efforts took place during the 1800s. Beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-[[acre]] (20&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]) mill pond that later became [[Haymarket Square (Boston)|Haymarket Square]]. The present-day [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] sits atop this shortened Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|South End]], [[West End, Boston, Massachusetts|West End]], the [[Financial District, Boston, Massachusetts|Financial District]] and [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]]. After [[Great Boston Fire of 1872|The Great Boston Fire of 1872]], workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront. During the mid-to-late nineteenth century, workers filled almost 600&nbsp;acres (2.4&nbsp;km²) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of the Boston Common with gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. In addition, the city annexed the adjacent towns of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] (1868), [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] (1870), [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts|Brighton]], [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts|West Roxbury]] (including present day [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]], Roslindale and West Roxbury), and [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]]. The last three towns were annexed in 1874.<ref>{{cite book |title=Historical Atlas of Massachusetts |pages=37 |year=1991 |publisher=University of Massachusetts}}</ref>

The first community health center in the United States was the Columbia Point Health Center in the [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] neighborhood of Boston. It was opened in December 1965 and served mostly the massive [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]] public housing complex adjoining it. It was founded by two medical doctors, Jack Geiger of Harvard University and Count Gibson of Tufts University. It is still in operation and was re-dedicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center.<ref> Roessner, Jane.

By the early and mid-twentieth century, the city was in decline as factories became old and obsolete, and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere.<ref name="history" /> Boston responded by initiating various [[urban renewal]] projects under the direction of the [[Boston Redevelopment Authority]] (BRA), which was established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition garnered vociferous public opposition to the new agency.<ref>{{cite web |author=Collins, Monica |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/07/born_again/ |title=Born Again |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=August 7, 2005 |accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> BRA subsequently reevaluated its approach to urban renewal in its future projects, including the construction of [[Government Center, Boston, Massachusetts|Government Center]]. By the 1970s, the city's economy boomed after thirty years of economic downturn. Hospitals such as [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] led the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Boston University]], [[Boston College]] and [[Northeastern University]] attracted students to the Boston area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over [[desegregation busing]], which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.

The Columbia Point housing projects, built in 1953 on the Dorchester peninsula, had gone through bad times until there were only 350 families living in it in 1988. It was run down and dangerous. In 1984, the city of Boston gave control of it to a private developer, Corcoran-Mullins-Jennison, who re-developed and revitalized the property into an attractive residential mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments which was opened in 1988 and completed by 1990. It is a very significant example of revitalization and re-development and was the first federal housing project to be converted to private, mixed-income housing in the United States.

In the early twenty-first century the city has become an intellectual, technological, and political center. It has, however, experienced a loss of regional institutions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/04/15/atlantic_148_year_institution_leaving_city/ |title=Atlantic, 148-year institution, leaving city |author=Feeney, Mark; Mehegan, David |date=April 15, 2005 |publisher=The Boston Globe |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> which included the acquisition of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' by ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such [[FleetBoston Financial]], which was acquired by [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]-based [[Bank of America]] in 2004. The city also had to tackle [[gentrification]] issues and rising living expenses, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s.

Owing to its early founding, Boston is very compact.  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 89.6&nbsp;square miles (232.1&nbsp;km²)—48.4&nbsp;square miles (125.4&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 41.2&nbsp;square miles (106.7&nbsp;km²) (46.0%) of it is water. Boston is the [[List of United States cities by population|fourth most densely populated]] city in the country not a part of a larger city's [[metropolitan area]].<ref>After New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago.  Many cities are denser but part of a larger city's metropolitan area such as [[Paterson, New Jersey]].</ref> Of United States cities over 500,000 in population, only [[San Francisco]] is smaller in land area. Boston's official elevation, as measured  at [[Logan International Airport]], is 19&nbsp;feet (5.8&nbsp;m) above sea level.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elevation data—Boston |url={{Gnis3|617565}} |year=2007 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> The highest point in Boston is [[Bellevue Hill, Boston|Bellevue Hill]] at 330&nbsp;feet (101&nbsp;m) above sea level, while the lowest point is at sea level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6759|title=Bellevue Hill, Massachusetts |publisher=Peakbagger.com |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref>

Boston is surrounded by the "[[Greater Boston]]" region, and bordered by the cities and towns of [[Winthrop, Massachusetts|Winthrop]], [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]], and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]].

Much of the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] and [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|South End]] neighborhoods are built on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]]—all of the earth from two of Boston's three original hills, the "trimount", was used as landfill material. Only [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]], the smallest of the three original hills, remains partially intact; just half of its height was cut down for landfill. The downtown area and immediate surroundings consist mostly of low-rise brick or stone buildings, with many older buildings in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. Several of these buildings mix in with modern high-rises, notably in the Financial District, [[Government Center (Boston)|Government Center]], the [[South Boston, Boston, Massachusetts|South Boston]] waterfront, and Back Bay, which includes many prominent landmarks such as the [[Boston Public Library]], [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science Center]], [[Copley Square]], [[Newbury Street]], and New England's two tallest buildings: the [[John Hancock Tower]] and the [[Prudential Tower|Prudential Center]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=101045 |title=Boston Skyscrapers |publisher=Emporis.com |year=2005 |accessdate=2005-05-15}}</ref> Near the John Hancock Tower is the [[John Hancock Tower#The Berkeley Building (the "old John Hancock Building")|old John Hancock Building]] with its prominent [[weather beacon|weather forecast beacon]]—whatever light illuminates gives an indication of weather to come: "steady blue. clear view; flashing blue, clouds are due; steady red, rain ahead; flashing red, snow instead." (In the summer, flashing red indicates instead that a [[Red Sox]] game has been rained out.) Smaller commercial areas are interspersed among single-family homes and wooden/brick multi-family row houses. Currently, the South End Historic District remains the largest surviving contiguous Victorian-era neighborhood in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southendhistoricalsociety.org/about.htm |title=About the SEHS |publisher=South End Historical Society |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref>

Along with downtown, the geography of [[South Boston, Boston, Massachusetts|South Boston]] was particularly impacted by the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) Project]] (or the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|"Big Dig"]]). The unstable reclaimed land in South Boston posed special problems for the project's tunnels. In the downtown area, the CA/T Project allowed for the removal of the unsightly elevated [[Central Artery]] and the incorporation of new green spaces and open areas. 

[[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]], located near the Financial District and Beacon Hill, is the oldest public park in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.celebrateboston.com/sites/bostoncommon.htm |title=Boston Common |year=2006 |publisher=CelebrateBoston.com |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> Along with the adjacent [[Boston Public Garden]], it is part of the [[Emerald Necklace]], a string of parks designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] to encircle the city. Franklin Park, which is also part of the [[Emerald Necklace]], is the city's largest park and houses a [[Franklin Park Zoo|zoo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/emerald/Franklin_Park.asp |title=Franklin Park |year=2007 |publisher=City of Boston |accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> Another major park is the [[Esplanade]] located along the banks of the [[Charles River]]. Other parks are scattered throughout the city, with the major parks and beaches located near [[Castle Island (Massachusetts)|Castle Island]], in Charlestown and along the Dorchester, South Boston, and East Boston shorelines.

===Climate===
Boston has what may basically be described as something between a [[humid continental climate]] and a [[humid subtropical climate]], such as is very common in New England. Summers are typically warm and humid, while winters are cold, windy and snowy. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore affect Boston, minimizing the influence of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Spring in Boston can be warm, with temperatures as high as the 90s when winds are offshore, though it is just as possible for a day in late May to remain in the lower 40s due to cool ocean waters. The hottest month is July, with an average high of 82&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (28&nbsp;°C) and average low of 66&nbsp;°F (18&nbsp;°C), with conditions usually humid. The coldest month is January, with an average high of 36&nbsp;°F (2&nbsp;°C) and an average low of 22&nbsp;°F (-6&nbsp;°C).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/climate/bosnml.shtml |publisher=NWS Taunton, MA |year=2006 |title=Boston Daily Normals |accessdate=2006-04-19}}</ref> Periods exceeding {{convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in summer and below {{convert|10|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in winter are not uncommon, but rarely prolonged. The record high temperature is 104&nbsp;°F (40&nbsp;°C), recorded July 4, 1911. The record low temperature is -18&nbsp;°F (-28&nbsp;°C), recorded on February 9, 1934. February in Boston has seen 70&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (21&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]]) only once in recorded history, on February 24, 1985. The maximum temperature recorded in March was 89&nbsp;°F (31&nbsp;°C), on March 31, 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/climate/bosrecords.html |publisher=NWS Taunton, MA |year=2006 |title=Boston Temperature Records |accessdate=2006-02-09}}</ref>

The city averages about 42&nbsp;[[inch|in]] (108&nbsp;cm) of precipitation a year, with 40.9&nbsp;in (104&nbsp;cm) of snowfall a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=090527&refer= |title=Historical Weather for Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America |publisher=Weatherbase |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> Snowfall increases dramatically as one goes inland away from the city and the warming influence of the ocean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/states/Massachusetts-Climate.html |title=Massachusetts—Climate |year=2005 |publisher=city-data.com (Thomson Gale) |accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>  Most snowfall occurs December through March, usually with little or no snow in April and November and rare snow events in May and October.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intellicast.com/Almanac/Northeast/May/ |title=May in the Northeast |year=2003 |publisher=Intellicast.com |accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/weather/articles/2005/10/30/snowstorm_packs_october_surprise/ |author=Wangsness, Lisa |title=Snowstorm packs October surprise |date=October 30, 2005 |publisher=The Boston Globe |accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

Boston's coastal location on the [[North Atlantic]], though it moderates temperatures, also makes the city very prone to [[Nor'easter]] weather systems that can produce much snow and rain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/arts/film/weather.asp |title=Weather |year=2007 |publisher=City of Boston Film Bureau |accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref><!--Someone confirm the numbers for Noreaster snowfall amounts-"dump more than 20&nbsp;in (50&nbsp;cm) of snow on the region in one storm event."--> Fog is prevalent, particularly in spring and early summer, and the occasional tropical storm or [[hurricane]] can threaten the region, especially in early autumn.

===Crime===
The city has seen a great reduction in violent [[crime]] since the early 1990s. Boston's low crime rate in the last years of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first has been credited to its [[Boston Police Department|police department's]] collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the [[United States Attorney]] and [[District Attorney]]'s offices. This helped lead in part to what has been touted as the "Boston Miracle." Murders in the city dropped from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31—not one of them a juvenile—in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000). In more recent years, however, the annual murder count has fluctuated by as much as 50% compared to the year before, with 60 murders in 2002, followed by just 39 in 2003, 64 in 2004, and 75 in 2005. Though the figures are nowhere near the high-water mark set in 1990, the aberrations in the murder rate have been unsettling for many Bostonians and have prompted discussion over whether the Boston Police Department should reevaluate its approach to fighting crime.<ref>{{cite web |author=Winship, Christopher |month=March |year=2002 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/winship/End_of_a_Miracle.pdf |format=pdf |title=End of a Miracle? |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/police/ore.asp |title=Boston Police Department's Monthly Crime Statistics |year=2005 |publisher=CityOfBoston.gov |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boston.areaconnect.com/crime1.htm |title=Boston MA Crime Statistics (2004—New Crime Data) |year=2007 |publisher=areaConnect.com |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref>

Boston's colleges and universities have a major impact on the city and region's economy. Not only are they major employers, but they also attract high-tech industries to the city and surrounding region. Boston is home to [[technology]] companies such as [[EMC Corp.]] and [[Analog Devices]] as well as [[E-Commerce]] companies [[VistaPrint]] and [[CSN Stores]]. Boston is also a major hub for [[biotechnology]] companies, including [[Millennium Pharmaceuticals]], [[Merck & Co.]], [[Millipore]], [[Genzyme]], and [[Biogen Idec]]. According to a 2003 report by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, students enrolled in Boston's colleges and universities contribute $4.8&nbsp;billion annually to the city's economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/bra/PDF/ResearchPublications//pdr97-2.pdf |format=pdf |title=Leadership Through Innovation: The History of Boston's Economy |year=2003 |publisher=Boston Redevelopment Authority |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> Boston also receives the highest amount of annual funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]] of all cities in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssti.org/Digest/Tables/022006t.htm |title=Top 100 NIH Cities |year=2004 |publisher=SSTI.org |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref>

Tourism comprises a large part of Boston's economy. In 2004 tourists spent $7.9&nbsp;billion and made the city one of the ten most popular tourist locations in the country.<ref name="economy"/> Other important industries include [[financial services]], especially [[mutual fund]]s and [[insurance]].<ref name="economy"/> Boston-based [[Fidelity Investments]] helped popularize the mutual fund in the 1980s, and has made Boston one of the top financial cities in the United States. The city is also the regional headquarters of major banks such as [[Bank of America]] and [[Sovereign Bank]], and a center for [[venture capital]]. [[State Street Corporation]], which specializes in asset management and custody services, is headquartered in the city. Boston is also a printing and publishing center – [[Houghton Mifflin]] is headquartered within the city, along with [[Bedford-St. Martin's|Bedford-St. Martin's Press]], [[Beacon Press]], and [[Little, Brown and Company]]. [[Pearson PLC]] publishing units also employ several hundred people in Boston. The city is home to four major [[convention center]]s: the [[Hynes Convention Center]] in the Back Bay, the Bayside Expo Center in Dorchester, and the World Trade Center Boston and [[Boston Convention and Exhibition Center]] on the South Boston waterfront. Because of its status as a state capital and the regional home of federal agencies, law and government is another major component of the city's economy.<ref name="economy" />

Major companies headquartered within the city include the [[Liberty Mutual]] insurance company, [[The Gillette Company|Gillette]] (now owned by [[Procter & Gamble]]), and [[Teradyne]], one of the world's leading manufacturers of semiconductor and other electronic test equipment.

Boston shares many cultural roots with greater New England, including a dialect of the non-[[Rhotic accent|rhotic]] [[American English#Eastern New England|Eastern New England]] accent known as [[Boston accent|Boston English]], and a [[New England cuisine|regional cuisine]] with a large emphasis on seafood, rum, salt, and dairy products. [[Irish Americans]] are a major influence on Boston's politics and religious institutions. Boston also has its own collection of [[neologism]]s known as Boston slang.

Many consider Boston to have a strong sense of cultural identity, perhaps as a result of its intellectual reputation; much of Boston's culture originates at its universities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phelan, Joseph |month=November |year=2004 |title=[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/feature-2004-11.html Boston Marathon] |journal=Artcyclopedia}}</ref> The city has several ornate theatres, including the [[Cutler Majestic Theatre]], [[Boston Opera House]], [[Citi Performing Arts Center]], and the Orpheum Theatre. Renowned performing-arts organizations include the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], [[Boston Ballet]], [[Boston Pops]], [[Celebrity Series of Boston]], [[Boston Early Music Festival]], [[Boston Lyric Opera|Boston Lyric Opera Company]], OperaBoston, [[Emmanuel Music]], and the [[Handel and Haydn Society]] (one of the oldest choral companies in the United States).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.handelandhaydn.org/learn/whoweare/whoweare_home.htm |title=Who We Are |year=2007 |publisher=Handel and Haydn Society |accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> There are also many major annual events such as [[First Night]], which occurs on [[New Year's Eve]], the annual [[Boston Arts Festival]] at Chistopher Columbus Waterfront Park, Italian summer feasts in the North End honoring Catholic saints, and several events during the [[Independence Day (US)|Fourth of July]] period. These events include the week-long Harborfest festivities<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonharborfest.com/about/index.html |title=About Boston Harborfest! |publisher=Boston Harborfest |date=January 15, 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> and a [[Boston Pops]] concert accompanied by fireworks on the banks of the [[Charles River]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.july4th.org/generaleventinfo/faqs/ |title=General Event Information—Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Boston 4 Celebrations Foundation |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

[[Image:Boston Symphony Hall from the south.jpg|thumb|[[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] designed by [[McKim, Mead, and White]].]]
Because of the city's prominent role in the [[American Revolution]], several historic sites relating to that period are preserved as part of the [[Boston National Historical Park]]. Many are found along the [[Freedom Trail]], which is marked by a red line of bricks embedded in the ground. The city is also home to several prominent art museums, including the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]]. In December 2006, the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston|Institute of Contemporary Art]] moved from its Back Bay location to a new contemporary building designed by [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]] located in the Seaport District. The [[University of Massachusetts]] campus at Columbia Point houses the [[John F. Kennedy Library]]. The [[Boston Athenaeum]] (one of the oldest independent libraries in the United States),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonathenaeum.org/general.html |title=General Information: Introduction and History |publisher=Boston Athenæum |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> [[Boston Children's Museum]], [[Bull & Finch Pub]] (whose building is known from the television show ''[[Cheers]]''), [[Museum of Science, Boston|Museum of Science]], and the [[New England Aquarium]] are within the city.

Boston is also one of the birthplaces of the [[hardcore punk]] genre of music. Boston musicians have contributed greatly to this music scene over the years (''see also [[Boston hardcore]]''). Boston neighborhoods were home to one of the leading local [[third wave ska]] and [[ska punk]] scenes in the 1990s, led by bands such as [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[The Allstonians]], [[Pixies|The Pixies]], and the [[Dropkick Murphys]]. The 1980s' hardcore punk-rock compilation ''[[This Is Boston, Not L.A.]]'' highlights some of the bands that built the genre.
