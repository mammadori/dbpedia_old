The [[etymology]] of London remains a mystery. The earliest etymological explanation can be attributed to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. The name is described as originating from [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]], who had allegedly taken over the city and named it ''Kaerlud''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/books/chapters/02-1st-ackro.html?ex=1225339200&en=b9c2c11ad6e1f435&ei=5070|title='London'|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> This would have had a derivational form ''Kaerludein'', which, by [[Aphesis|aphaeresis]], eventually developed as ''London''. Many [[Etymology of London|other theories]] have been advanced over the centuries, most of them deriving the name from [[Welsh people|Welsh]] or [[British language (Celtic)|British]]. It is also believed the name "London" comes from the celtic word "Lyndon", which means "shadowy waters", referring to the Thames River.

Although there is evidence of scattered [[Britons (historic)|Brythonic]] settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 43 AD as ''[[Roman London|Londinium]]'', following the [[Roman conquest of Britain]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Roman London |last=Perring |first=Dominic |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0203231333|page=1}}</ref> This [[Londinium]] lasted for just seventeen years. Around 61, the [[Iceni]] tribe led by Queen [[Boudica]] stormed this first [[Londinium|London]], burning it to the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/romanbritain_timeline_noflash.shtml|title=British History Timeline — Roman Britain|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> The next, heavily planned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded [[Colchester]] as the capital of the [[Roman Britain|Roman province]] of [[Britannia]] in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.

By the 600s, the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had created a new settlement called [[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]] approximately {{convert|1000|yd|m}} upstream from the old Roman city,
around what is now [[Covent Garden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm|title=The early years of Lundenwic|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> It is likely that there was a harbour at the mouth of the [[River Fleet]] for fishing and trading, and this trading grew until the city was overcome by the [[Viking]]s and forced to relocate the city back to the location of the Roman ''Londinium'' to use its walls for protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/Onlineresources/RWWC/themes/1295/1288|title=Viking and Danish London|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> Viking attacks continued to increase around the rest of [[South East England]], until 886 when [[Alfred the Great]] recaptured London and made peace with the Danish leader, [[Guthrum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Permanent/medieval/Themes/1033/1035/default.htm|title=Medieval London — Vikings|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> The original Saxon city of Lundenwic became ''Ealdwic'' ("old city"), a name surviving to the present day as [[Aldwych]], which is in the modern [[City of Westminster]].

In a retaliatory attack, Ethelred's army achieved victory by pulling down [[London Bridge]] with the Danish garrison on top, and English control was re-established. Canute took control of the English throne in 1016, controlling the city and country until 1035, when his death resulted in a reversion to [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] control under his pious stepson [[Edward the Confessor]], who re-founded [[Westminster Abbey]] and the adjacent [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/edward_confessor.shtml|title=Edward the Confessor (c.1003 - 1066)|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref> By this time, London had become the largest and most prosperous city in England, although the official [[seat of government]] was still at [[Winchester]].

In 1097, [[William II of England|William II]] began the building of [[Westminster Hall]], close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new [[Palace of Westminster]], the prime royal residence throughout [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/history/building.cfm|title=UK Parliament — Parliament: The building|date=2007-11-09|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliament/guide/palace.htm|title=Palace of Westminster|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> Westminster became the seat of the royal court and government (persisting until the present day), while its distinct neighbour, the City of London, was a centre of trade and commerce and flourished under its own unique administration, the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]].

After the successful defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, political stability in England allowed London to grow further. In 1603, [[James VI of Scotland]] came to the throne of England, essentially uniting the two countries. His enactment of harsh [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] laws made him unpopular, and an [[Assassination|assassination attempt]] was made on 5 November 1605—the well-known [[Gunpowder Plot]].<ref>{{cite book |title=James I |last=Durston |first=Christopher|year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0415077796 |page=59}}</ref>

[[Image:LondonBombedWWII full.jpg|thumb|right|A London street hit during [[the Blitz]] of [[World War II]]]]
Following London's growth in the 18th century, it became the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/i-m/london4.html|title=London: The greatest city |publisher=Channel4.com|accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> Rising [[traffic congestion]] on city centre roads led to the creation of the world's first rapid transit. The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] oversaw infrastructure expansion. It was then replaced by the [[County of London]], overseen by the [[London County Council]], London's first elected city-wide administration.

[[The Blitz]] and other bombing by the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during [[World War II]] killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across London. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/london_blasts/what_happened/html/default.stm|title=BBC News — London Attacks|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref>

===Local government===
{{Main|Local government in London|History of local government in London}}

The administration of London is formed of two tiers — a city-wide, strategic tier and a local tier. City-wide administration is coordinated by the [[Greater London Authority]] (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/|title=About the Greater London Authority|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref> The GLA consists of two elected parts; the [[Mayor of London]], who has executive powers, and the [[London Assembly]], who scrutinise the Mayor's decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year. The GLA was set up in 2000 to replace the similar [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) which had been abolished in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/history.jsp|title=A short history of London government|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref> The headquarters of the GLA and the Mayor of London is at [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]]; the current Mayor is [[Boris Johnson]]. The 33 local authorities are the councils of the 32 [[London borough]]s and the [[City of London Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london/links.jsp|title=Links to other websites - London boroughs|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref> They are responsible for local services not overseen by the GLA, such as local planning, schools, [[Social work|social services]], local roads and refuse collection.

===National government===
London is an important city because the Government of the United Kingdom is located around
the Palace of Westminster. Many government departments are located close to Parliament, particularly along [[Whitehall]], including the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister's]] residence at [[10 Downing Street]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page1.asp|title=10 Downing Street — Official Website|publisher=10 Downing Street|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> The British Parliament is often referred to as the "Mother of Parliaments" (although this ''[[sobriquet]]'' was first applied to England itself by [[John Bright]])<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/96021.stm |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2008-06-06 |date=1998-06-03 |title=UK Politics: Talking Politics — The 'Mother of Parliaments'}}</ref> because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments.<!-- **Incomplete sentence** There are 74 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) from London, who correspond to local parliamentary [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Greater London|constituencies]] in the national [[British House of Commons|Parliament]] by .<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/4293078.stm|title=London: Ethnic vote |date=30 September 2005|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> Of these 74 MPs, 44 are from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], 21 are [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], 8 are [[Liberal Democrats]] and one is from the [[Respect – The Unity Coalition|RESPECT]] party.-->

===Topography===
Greater London covers an area of {{convert|607|sqmi|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244011/Greater-London|title=Greater London - Britannica Online Encyclopaedia|publisher=Encylopaedia Britannica|accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref> Its primary geographical feature is the [[River Thames|Thames]], a [[navigable river]] which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The [[Thames Valley]] is a [[floodplain]] surrounded by gently rolling hills including [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]], [[Addington Hills]], and [[Primrose Hill]]. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive [[marshland]]s; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=thames+%22iron+age%22+london+wide+geography+shallow+marsh&ots=wVDtRsVF-V&sig=GFqR9QKs45u-ggfYI0dcCA3GUzc#PPA10,M1|title=''London: A History, by Francis Sheppard page 10.|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> Since the [[Victorian era]] it has been extensively [[Thames Embankment|embanked]], and many of its London [[tributary|tributaries]] now flow [[Subterranean rivers of London|underground]]. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/flooding/?version=1&lang=_e|title=Flooding|publisher=UK [[Environment Agency]]|accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref> The threat has increased over time due to a slow but continuous rise in [[Tide|high water]] level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-[[glacier|glacial]] [[isostatic rebound|rebound]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/sealevels/?version=1&lang=_e|title="Sea Levels" - UK Environment Agency|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the [[Thames Barrier]] across the Thames at [[Woolwich]] to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2030, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5092218.stm|title=BBC News: On the rise: The Thames in 2100|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref>

===[[Climate]]===
{{Main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
London has a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|marine climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification]] Cfb), like much of the British Isles, so the city rarely sees extremely high or low temperatures. Summers are warm with average high temperatures of {{convert|21|°C|°F}} - {{convert|24|°C|°F}} and lows of {{convert|11|°C|°F}} - {{convert|14|°C|°F}}. But temperatures can exceed {{convert|25|°C|°F}} on many days, and in almost every year they exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F}} on some days. The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|39|°C|°F}} <ref name="AverageWeatherLondon">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003790|title=Average Conditions, London, United Kingdom|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> on 10<sup>th</sup> August 2003. Winters in London are chilly, but rarely below freezing with daytime highs around {{convert|8|°C|°F}} - {{convert|12|°C|°F}}, while spring has mild days and cool evenings.<ref name="AverageWeatherLondon" /> The lowest ever recorded temperature is {{convert|-10|°C|°F}}.{{fact|date=July 2009}} Autumn is usually mild but often unsettled as colder air from the north and warmer air from the south meet, occasionally deep depressions form like the [[Great Storm of 1987]].

London is a relatively dry city with regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year, with average precipitation of {{convert|583.6|mm|in}} every year.
Snow is relatively uncommon, particularly because [[Urban heat island|heat from the urban area]] can make London up to 5&nbsp;°C (9&nbsp;°F) warmer than the surrounding areas in winter. Some [[snow]]fall, however, is usually seen up to a few times a year. The [[United Kingdom snow storm of February 2009|snowfall of February 2009]] was the heaviest London had seen for 18 years. London is in [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 9, and [[Hardiness zone|AHS Heat Zone 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/news/climate_change/chapter4_5.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chapter 4 59 Plants in natural and managed communities|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|pages=6|accessdate=2008-09-27}}{{dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref>

In the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, London was noted for its dense fogs and smogs. Following the deadly [[Great Smog of 1952]], the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] was passed, leading to the decline of such severe pollution in the capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/education/secondary/students/smog.html|title=Met Office: The Great Smog of 1952|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>

===Districts===
{{Seealso|List of places in London|Central London|Inner London|Outer London}}
London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names (e.g. [[Bloomsbury]], [[Knightsbridge]], [[Mayfair]], [[Whitechapel]], [[Fitzrovia]]). These are either informal designations, or reflect the names of superseded villages, parishes and city wards. Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but often with no modern official boundaries. However, since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 [[London borough]]s in addition to the ancient City of London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp|title=London boroughs - London Life, GLA|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|coauthors=John D.

With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world until overtaken by New York in 1925. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of World War 2. There were an estimated 7,556,900 official residents in [[Greater London]] as of mid-2007.<ref name=Greater_London_population /> However, London's continuous [[urban area]] extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 8,278,251 people in 2001,<ref name=urban_area_pop /> while its wider [[metropolitan area]] has a population of between 12 and 14&nbsp;million depending on the definition used.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} According to [[Eurostat]], London is the [[Largest cities and metropolitan areas in the European Union (Eurostat)|most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union]] and the second [[Largest European cities and metropolitan areas|most populous]] in Europe (or third if [[Istanbul]] is included).

The region covers an area of {{convert|609|sqmi|km2}}.

London's success as a [[Tertiary sector of industry|service industry]] and business centre can be attributed to factors such as English being the native and dominant language of business, close relationship with the U.S. and various countries in Asia.

London's largest industry remains finance, and its [[financial export]]s make it a large contributor to the UK's [[balance of payments]]. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world.
London is home to banks, brokers, insurers and legal and accounting firms.

Science and research and development are playing an increasingly important role in shaping the economy of modern London with 1,340 million euros of public funding, 25 research institutes and medical schools and 23 National Health Service hospitals. The city has 175,000 health-care professionals, 6,000 scientists specialising in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and, yearly, 80,000 medical and science students studying at universities and colleges. London's private concerns conducting scientific research, as many as 100 in the life science sector alone in 2008, are growing in number twice as fast as in the rest of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investinscience.com/scienceheavens_company_profile.aspx?nHeavenId=14 |title=Welcome to Invest In Science Ventures |publisher=Investinscience.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

London is too diverse to be characterised by any particular [[architectural]] style, having accumulated its buildings over a long period of time and drawn on a wide range of influences. It is, however, mainly [[brick]] built, most commonly the yellow [[London stock brick]] or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1&xml=/property/2008/03/27/lpgreen127.xml|title=Eco homes: Wooden it be lovely... ?|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> Many grand houses and public buildings (such as the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]]) are constructed from [[Portland stone]]. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white [[stucco]] or whitewashed buildings. Few structures pre-date the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666, except for a few trace [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, the [[Tower of London]] and a few scattered [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] survivors in the City. The disused (but soon to be rejuvenated) 1939 [[Battersea Power Station]] by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] and [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]] (at least internally).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html|title=Paddington Station.|publisher=Great Buildings|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref>

The density of London varies, with high employment density in the [[Central London|central area]], high residential densities in [[inner London]] and lower densities in the [[Outer London|suburbs]]. In the dense areas, most of the concentration is achieved with medium- and [[high-rise]] buildings. London's skyscrapers such as the notable [[30 St Mary Axe|"Gherkin"]], [[Tower 42]], the [[Broadgate Tower]] and [[One Canada Square]] are usually found in the two financial districts, the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]]. Other notable modern buildings include [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] in [[Southwark]] with its distinctive oval shape,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm|title=Inside London's new 'glass egg'|date= 16 July 2002|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> and the [[British Library]] in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]/[[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]]. What was formerly the [[Millennium Dome]], located by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now used as an entertainment venue known as The O<sub>2</sub>.

The development of [[Tall buildings in London|tall buildings]] has been encouraged in the [[London Plan]], which will lead to the erection of [[Tall buildings in London#Tallest under construction.2C approved and proposed|many new skyscrapers]] over the next decade, particularly in the City of London and Canary Wharf.

As of July 2008, there are 426 high-rise buildings (between 23 m to 150 m/75 ft to 491 ft) under construction, approved for construction, and proposed for construction in London.

A great many monuments pay homage to people and events in the city. [[The Monument]] in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the [[Great Fire of London]], which originated nearby. [[Marble Arch]] and [[Wellington Arch]], at the north and south ends of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] respectively, have royal connections, as do the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is a nationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], one of the focal points of the centre.

===Accent===
Traditionally the London accent has been given the famous [[Cockney]] label, and was similar to many accents of the South East of England, developing a unique form of slang known as Cockney Rhyming Slang. The accent of a 21st century Londoner varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under 30s however is some fusion of Cockney, Received Pronunciation, and a whole array of 'ethnic' accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled [[Jafaican|Multicultural London English]] (MLE).<ref name="MCLE">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/jafaican-and-tikkiny-drown-out-the-east-ends-cockney-twang-473688.html|title=Jafaican and Tikkiny drown out the East End's Cockney twang|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|date=2006-04-11|work=The Independent|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref>

===Railways===

The centrepiece of the public transport network is the [[London Underground]] — commonly referred to as The Tube — which has eleven interconnecting lines. It is one of the oldest, longest, and most expansive [[rapid transit|metro]] systems in the world, dating from 1863.<ref name="Metro1"/><ref name="Metro"/> The system was home to the world's first underground electric line, the [[City & South London Railway]], which began service in 1890.<ref name="UrbanRail">{{cite web|url=http://de.geocities.com/u_london/london.htm|title=London Underground|last=Schwandl|first=Robert|year=2001|publisher=UrbanRail.net|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> Over three million journeys a day are made on the Underground network, nearly 1&nbsp;billion journeys each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/4770.aspx|title=Tube carries one billion passengers for first time|date=28 March 2008|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> The world's longest subway system runs for 244 miles below the streets of London. The London Underground - or tube, as it's known by the locals - carries about 976 million people each year. The city's first underground railroad opened in 1863, and today it operates 500 peak trains and 275 stations. The subway's busiest station is Waterloo, which serves about 46,000 commuters during the morning rush. Throughout the subway system, some 412 escalators and 112 elevators keep commuter traffic moving. The Underground serves the central area and most suburbs to the north of the Thames, while those to the south are served by an extensive [[Regional rail|suburban rail]] surface network, due partly to more difficult geology south of the river.

The [[Docklands Light Railway]] is a second metro system using smaller and lighter trains, which opened in 1987, serving [[East London, England|East London]] and Greenwich on both sides of the [[River Thames|Thames]]. Commuter and intercity railways generally do not cross the city, instead running into [[London railway station|fourteen terminal stations]] scattered around its historic centre; the exception is the [[Thameslink]] route operated by [[First Capital Connect]], with its [[Bedford]] to [[Brighton]] and [[Luton]] to [[Sutton railway station|Sutton]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/Main.php?sEvent=HomePage|title=First Capital Connect|publisher=First Capital Connect ltd|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> Since the early 1990s, increasing pressures on the commuter rail and Underground networks have led to increasing demands — particularly from businesses and the [[City of London Corporation]] — for [[Crossrail]]: a £10&nbsp;billion east–west heavy rail connection under central London, which was given the green light in early October 2007.<ref name="Olympic Infrastructure" />

High-speed [[Eurostar]] trains link [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras International]] with [[Lille]] and Paris in France, and [[Brussels]] in Belgium. Journey times to Paris and Brussels of 2h 15 and 1h 51 respectively make London closer to continental Europe than the rest of Britain by virtue of the newly completed [[High Speed 1]] rail link to the [[Channel Tunnel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurostar.com/dynamic/index.jsp;ERSPRDSession=LJqZB7nyKlW9lVLvZzK534LvMjL519fPDS4R0QGn51CprylVmjH8!685848002|title=Eurostar|publisher=Eurostar|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> From 2009 this line will also allow for high speed domestic travel from Kent into London. The redevelopment of St. Pancras was key to London's Olympic bid, as the station also serves two international airports through Thameslink, and will also provide direct rail links to the Olympic site at [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] using [[British Rail Class 395]] trains running under the ''[[Olympic Javelin]]'' name; these will be based on Japanese [[Shinkansen]] high-speed trains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpancras.com/about-stpancras/|title=About St Pancras International Train Station|publisher=saint Pancras International Train Station|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref>

In 2003, the network's ridership was estimated at over 1.5 billion passenger trips per annum, more than the Underground.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Transport for London]] |title=London Buses |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/1548.aspx |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> Around £850 million is taken in revenue each year.

London has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the world<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3609.aspx|title=London's bus improvements get Parliamentary seal of approval|date=23 May 2006|publisher=Transport For London|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> and, from the 3rd quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced. The distinctive red double-decker buses are internationally recognised, and are a trademark of London transport along with [[Hackney carriage|black cabs]] and the Tube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonblackcabs.co.uk/|title=London Black Cabs|publisher=London Black Cabs|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2625.aspx|title=Tube — Transport for London|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref>

London is a major international air transport hub with the largest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the words ''London Airport'' in their name, but most traffic passes through one of five major airports. [[London Heathrow Airport]] is the [[World's busiest airport|busiest airport]] in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, [[British Airways]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/|title=BAA Heathrow: Official Website|publisher=BAA|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrow-airport-uk.info/heathrow-airport-terminal-5.htm|title=Heathrow Airport Terminal 5|publisher=TMC Ltd|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> and plans are already being considered for a sixth terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/site/heathrow/menuitem.2ea84de4d9bc8a0ca4b12871120103a0/%3bjsessionid=DNAfOXj7g3r3fk1j9NlWANpydf0hhlQvi8LcmzuRluuyU0u2FTlo!-949195938|title=About Heathrow|publisher=BAA Heathrow|accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref> Similar traffic, with the addition of some [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] [[short-haul]] flights, is also handled at [[London Gatwick Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatwickairport.com/|title=BAA Gatwick: Gatwick Airport|publisher=BAA|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> [[London Stansted Airport]] the main hub for Ryanair, and [[London Luton Airport]] cater mostly for low-cost short-haul flights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanstedairport.com/|title=BAA Stansted : Stansted Airport|year=2008|publisher=BAA|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-luton.co.uk/en/|title=London Luton Airport|publisher=London Luton Airport|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> [[London City Airport]], the smallest and most central airport, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable [[business jet]] traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londoncityairport.com/Default.aspx|title=London City Airport — Corporate Information|publisher=London City Airport Ltd.|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> [[London Southend Airport]] is developing new service in 2009 in addition to existing business aviation and cargo services. There has been continued controversy over expanding capacity such as building a third runway at Heathrow and building a new airport.

===Roads===
Although the majority of journeys involving [[central London]] are made by public transport, travel in outer London is car-dominated. The [[London Inner Ring Road|inner ring road]] (around the city centre), the [[A406 road|North]] and [[A205 road|South Circular]] roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital [[motorway]] (the [[M25 motorway|M25]], outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes — but very few motorways penetrate into [[inner London]]. The M25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at {{convert|121.5|mi|km}} long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/travel/m25/m25_facts.shtml |title=Beds, Herts and Bucks Travel - All you need to know about the M25 |publisher=BBC |date=1988-08-17 |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref> A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the [[London Ringways|Ringways Plan]]) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. In 2003, a [[London congestion charge|congestion charge]] was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £8 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of congested central London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/roadusers/congestioncharge/whereandwhen/|title=Charging Zone | Transport for London | Where and when|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6741.aspx|title=Who pays what | Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a vastly reduced season pass which is renewed monthly and is cheaper than a corresponding bus fare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6735.aspx|title=Residents | Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> London is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the M25 motorway the busiest stretch in the country. It has been worked out that the average speed of a car in the rush hour in London is 10.6 mph.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

==Education==
{{Main|Education in London}}
[[Image:RoyalHolloway FrontEntrance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]], as a part of the [[University of London]], a federation of London higher education institutions]]
Home to a range of universities, colleges and schools, London has a student population of about 378,000 and is a centre of [[research and development]]. Most primary and secondary schools in London follow the [[Education in England|same system as the rest of England]] — comprehensive schooling.

With 125,000 students, the [[University of London]] is the largest contact teaching university in the United Kingdom and in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.ac.uk/aboutus|title=About the University|date=2006-02-20|publisher=University of London|accessdate=2006-06-03}}</ref> It comprises 20 colleges as well as several smaller institutes each with a high degree of autonomy. Constituent colleges have their own [[University and college admissions|admissions]] procedures, and are effectively universities in their own right, although most degrees are awarded by the University of London rather than the individual colleges. Its constituents include multi-disciplinary colleges such as [[Royal Holloway]], [[Birkbeck College|Birkbeck]], [[University College London|UCL]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/current-students/rights/jurisdiction/|title=UCL — Jurisdiction over Students|date=7 November 2005|publisher=University College London|accessdate=2008-04-28}}{{dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref> [[King's College London|King's]], [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths]], [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/prospective_students/undergraduate/holloway/history/academic.shtml|title=Academic leadership — Royal Holloway|date=31 October 2007|publisher=University of London|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> and more specialised institutions such as the [[London School of Economics]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/|title=London School of Economics and Political Science|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/|title=The School of Oriental and African Studies|publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies]]|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> the [[Royal Academy of Music]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/subjectlevel/q94_95_textonly.htm|title= Quality Assessment Report by the HEFCE for the Royal Academy of Music|publisher=[[Royal Academy of Music]]|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] and the [[Institute of Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/index.html|title=Institute of Education — University of London|publisher=[[Institute of Education]]|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref>

[[Imperial College London]] and [[University College London]] have been ranked among the top ten universities in the world by [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]: in 2008 [[Imperial College London|Imperial]] was ranked the 6th best and [[University College London|UCL]] the 7th best university in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article4910798.ece|title=Why University top 200 in full|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref>

In addition, the [[London School of Economics]] is the world‘s leading social science institution for teaching and research, plus has the most international student body of any university in the world today.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/sunday_times_university_guide/article2496158.ece |title=The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2007 - Profile for London School of Economics|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref>

London's other universities, such as [[Brunel University]], [[City University, London|City University]], [[London Metropolitan University]], [[Middlesex University]], [[University of East London]], [[University of the Arts London]], [[University of Westminster]], [[Kingston University]] and [[London South Bank University]] are not part of the University of London but are still leaders in their field and popular choices among students both nationally and internationally. Some were [[Institute of technology|polytechnics]] until they were granted university status in [[Further and Higher Education Act, 1992|1992]], and others which were founded much earlier. Imperial College London left the federal University of London in 2007. Since the merger of [[University of North London]] and [[London Guildhall University]] in 2003, London Metropolitan University is the largest unitary university in the capital, with over 34,000 students from 155 countries.<ref>[http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/o90402_3.pdf About London Met] London Metropolitan University, August 2008</ref> London is also known globally for its business education, with the [[London Business School]] (ranked 1st in Europe — Business Week)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/europe/special_reports/03/31/2008europeanb-s.htm|title=Business Week|publisher= Business Week|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> and [[Cass Business School]] (Europe's largest finance school) both being top world-rated business schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/|title=Cass Business School|year=2007|publisher=Cass Business School|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> In addition there are three international universities: [[Schiller International University]], [[Richmond University]] and [[Regent's College]].
