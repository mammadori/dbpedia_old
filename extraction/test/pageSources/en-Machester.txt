==History==
{{main|History of Manchester}}
===Etymology===
The name Manchester originates from the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] name ''[[Mamucium]]'', the name of the Roman fort and settlement, generally thought to be a [[Latin]]isation of an original [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name (possibly meaning "breast-like hill" from ''mamm-'' = "breast"), plus [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ceaster'' = "town", which is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[castra]]'' = "camp".<ref name="Place names">{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_Titles__2B_05|last=Mills|first=A.D.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198527586}}</ref> An alternative theory suggests that the origin is [[Brittonic|British Celtic]] ''mamma'' = "mother", where the "mother" was a river-goddess of the [[River Medlock]] which flows below the fort. ''Mam'' means "female [[breast]]" in [[Irish Gaelic]] and "mother" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>[[The Antiquaries Journal]] (ISSN 0003-5815) 2004, vol. 84, pp. 353-357</ref> Manchester is also the [[List of the most common U.S. place names|10th most common place name in the United States]].

===Early history===

The [[Brigantes]] were the major [[Celtic tribes in Britain and Ireland|Celtic tribe]] of what is now [[Northern England]] who had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which [[Manchester Cathedral]] now stands, opposite the banks of the [[River Irwell]].<ref name="Cooper">{{cite book |first=Glynis |last=Cooper |title=Salford: An Illustrated History |publisher=The Breedon Books Publishing Company |year=2005 |isbn=1859834558|page=19}}</ref> Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now [[Salford]] and [[Stretford]]. Following the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in the 1st century, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|General Agricola]] ordered the construction of a  [[Castra|Roman fort]] in the year 79 named [[Mamucium]] to ensure Roman interests with [[Deva Victrix]] ([[Chester]]) and [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) were protected from the Brigantes.<ref name="Cooper"/> Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time.<ref name="Roman">{{cite book | title=Halloween: from Pagan Ritual to Party Night| url=http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780195168969| last=Rogers| first=Nicholas| year=2003| pages=18| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| isbn=0195168968}}</ref> A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the Roman fort is visible in [[Castlefield]]. The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century; the ''[[vicus]]'', or civilian settlement appears to have been abandoned by the mid 3rd century although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Richard (ed) |title=Roman Manchester: The University of Manchester's Excavations within the Vicus 2001&ndash;5 |page=190 |publisher=Oxbow Books |year=2007 |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-84217-271-1}}</ref> By the time of the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066 the focus of settlement had shifted to the confluence of the rivers Irwell and [[River Irk|Irk]].<ref name="Kidd">{{cite book|title=Manchester: A History| last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|pages= 12, 15–24, 224|publisher=Carnegie Publishing Ltd|location=Lancaster, Lancashire|isbn=1859361285}}</ref> Much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent [[Harrying of the North]].<ref name="Hylton">{{cite book|title=A History of Manchester|last=Hylton|first=Stuart|year=2003|pages=Pg. 1–10, 22, 25, 42, 63–67, 69|publisher=Phillimore & Co Ltd|isbn=1860772404}}</ref><ref name="Arrowsmith">{{cite book|title=Stockport: a History|last=Arrowsmith|first=Peter|year=1997|pages=Pg. 30|publisher=Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council|isbn=0-905164-99-7}}</ref>

Thomas de la Warre, lord of the manor, founded and constructed a collegiate church for the [[Manchester (ancient parish)|parish]] in 1421. The church is now [[Manchester Cathedral]]; the domestic premises of the college now house [[Chetham's School of Music]] and [[Chetham's Library]].<ref name="Hartwell">{{cite book|title=Pevsner Architectural Guides: Manchester|last=Hartwell|first=Clare|year=2001|pages= 11–17, 155, 256, 267–268|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London, England|isbn=0140711317}}</ref><ref name="Kidd"/>

Around the 14th century, Manchester received an influx of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers, sometimes credited as the foundation of the region's textile industry.<ref name="Flemish">{{cite book | title=Lancashire, The Industrial and Commercial South| last=Pevsner| first=Nikolaus| year=1969| pages=Pg. 265| publisher=Penguin Books Ltd| location=London, England| isbn=0-14-071036-1}}</ref> Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of [[wool]]lens and [[linen]], and by about 1540, had expanded to become, in [[John Leland]]'s words, "The fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire."<ref name="Kidd"/> The cathedral and Chetham's buildings are the only significant survivors of Leland's Manchester.<ref name="Hylton"/>

During the [[English Civil War]], Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long lasting, [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] granted it the right to elect its own MP.  [[Charles Worsley]], who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the [[Rule of the Major Generals]]. He was a diligent [[puritan]], turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of [[Christmas]]; he died in 1656.<ref>{{cite book | title= Cromwell's major generals: godly government during the English Revolution | series= Politics, culture, and society in early modern Britain | author= Durston, Christopher | year= 2001 | publisher= Manchester University Press | location= Manchester | isbn= 0-7190-6065-6 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Hw622QZHTcYC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22charles+worsley%22&source=web&ots=8WMX5JLZMr&sig=jETxrMz9PN_X_ODRafgco276NBg | accessdate= 2008-01-17}}</ref>

Significant quantities of [[cotton]] began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton [[fustian]]s, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance.<ref name="Kidd"/> The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The [[Bridgewater Canal]], Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at [[Worsley]] to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton.<ref name="Kidd"/><ref name="Hartwell"/> Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns.<ref name="Kidd"/> A [[commodities exchange]], opened in 1729,<ref name="Hylton"/> and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce.

In 1780, [[Richard Arkwright]] began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill.<ref name="Hartwell"/><ref name="Hylton"/>

===Industrial Revolution===

Much of Manchester's history is concerned with [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]. The great majority of [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]] took place in the towns of [[Greater Manchester|south Lancashire and north Cheshire]], and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing,<ref name="GM Arch">{{cite book|author=McNeil, R. & Nevell, M|title=A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of Greater Manchester|publisher=Association for Industrial Archaeology|year=2000|isbn=0-9528930-3-7}}</ref> and later the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods.<ref name="Kidd"/><ref name=Hall>{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Peter | title = Cities in Civilization | publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-297-84219-6 | chapter = The first industrial city: Manchester 1760-1830}}</ref> Manchester was dubbed "[[Cottonopolis]]" and "Warehouse City" during the [[Victorian era]].<ref name="GM Arch"/>

Manchester began expanding "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned [[urbanisation]] brought on by the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name="Cotton">{{cite book|title=The Cotton Industry|last=Aspin|first=Chris|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|year=1981|isbn=0-85263-545-1|page=3}}</ref> It developed a wide range of industries, so that by 1835 "Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world."<ref name=Hall/> Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, but diversified into general manufacture. Similarly, the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes, but expanded into other areas. Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance. Trade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the world's first intercity passenger railway—the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down.<ref name="Kidd"/> In 1878 the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] (the forerunner of [[BT Group|British Telecom]]) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.<ref name="GPO">{{Cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/1851to1880/1878.htm|title=Events in Telecommunications History|accessdate=2007-07-30|publisher=BT Archives|year=1878}}</ref>

The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was created by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey for {{convert|36|mi|km|0}} from [[Salford]] to the Mersey estuary. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canal's banks, just outside the borough, the world's first industrial estate was created at [[Trafford Park]].<ref name="Kidd"/><!--1993, p103 -->  Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.  
[[Image:Peterloo Massacre.png|thumb|left|The [[Peterloo Massacre]] of 1819 saw 15 deaths and several hundred injured.]]
A centre of capitalism, Manchester was frequented by bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes.  The most famous example ended in the [[Peterloo Massacre]] on 16 August 1819. Manchester was the subject of [[Friedrich Engels]]' ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]''; Engels himself spent much of his life in and around Manchester.<ref name="Engles">{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm|title=Marx-Engels Internet Archive – Biography of Engels|accessdate=2007-07-30|publisher=Marx/Engels Biography Archive|year=1893}}</ref>  The first [[Trades Union Congress]] was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was also an important cradle of the [[Labour Party (UK)| Labour Party]] and the [[Suffragette]] Movement.<ref>{{cite book|title=Manchester: A history|last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|chapter=Chapter 9 England Arise! The Politics of Labour and Womens's Suffrage|publisher=Carnegie Publishing Ltd|location=Lancaster, Lancashire|isbn=1859361285}}</ref>  

At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]], promoting [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe.

Many of the great public buildings (including the Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a [[county borough]] with even greater autonomy.

Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian [[Simon Schama]] noted that "Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke". An American visitor taken to Manchester’s blackspots saw “wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments”.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Victoria and Her Sisters |series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 2002-06-04 |number=13 }}</ref>

The number of [[cotton mill]]s in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853.<ref name="GM Arch"/> Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by [[Bolton]] in the 1850s and [[Oldham]] in the 1860s.<ref name="GM Arch"/> However, this period of decline coincided with the rise of city as the financial centre of the region.<ref name="GM Arch"/> Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area.<ref name="Kidd"/> The [[First World War]] interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

===World War II===
Like most of the UK, the Manchester area mobilised extensively during [[World War II]]. For example, casting and machining expertise at [[Beyer, Peacock and Company]]'s locomotive works in [[Gorton]] was switched to bomb making; [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]'s rubber works in [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]] made [[barrage balloon]]s; and just outside the city in [[Trafford Park]], engineers [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] made [[Avro Manchester]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] built the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the [[Luftwaffe]], and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets. The biggest took place during the "[[Manchester Blitz|Christmas Blitz]]" on the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940, when an estimated 467 [[long ton|ton]]s (475 tonnes) of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses were damaged.<ref>{{cite book | last= Hardy | first= Clive | title= Manchester at War | edition= (2nd edition) | year=  2005 | publisher  First Edition <!-- sic --> | location=  | isbn= 1-84547-096-6 | pages= pg.&nbsp;75–99 | chapter= The blitz }}</ref>  [[Manchester Cathedral]] was among the buildings seriously damaged; its restoration took 20 years.<ref name="WWII">{{Cite web | url= http://www.manchestercathedral.org/content/blogcategory/33/158/8/40/ | title= Timeline | accessdate= 2008-10-09 | publisher= Manchester Cathedral Online | year= 2008}}</ref>

Regeneration began in the late 1980s, with initiatives such as the Metrolink, the Bridgewater Concert Hall, the Manchester Evening News Arena, and (in Salford) the rebranding of the port as Salford Quays.

===1996 bomb===
{{main|1996 Manchester bombing}}
Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans, including the [[Manchester Martyrs]] of 1867, arson in 1920, a series of explosions in 1939, and two bombs in 1992. On Saturday 15 June 1996, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) detonated a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb injured over 200 people, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows half a mile away. The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at £50&nbsp;million, but this was quickly revised upwards.<ref name="1996 IRA costs">{{cite book | title= A History of Manchester| first= Stuart | last=Hylton| year= 2003| pages=pg. 227–230 | publisher= Phillimore & Co Ltd | isbn= 1860772404}}</ref> The final insurance payout was over £400&nbsp;million; many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade.<ref name="IRA business">{{Cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/3704943.stm | title= Panorama – The cost of terrorism | accessdate= 2008-10-09 | publisher=[[BBC]] | date= 15 May 2004}}</ref>

Manchester is represented by three tiers of government, [[Manchester City Council]] ("local"), UK Parliament ("national"), and European Parliament ("Europe"). [[Greater Manchester County Council]] administration was abolished in 1986, and so the [[city council]] is effectively a [[unitary authority]]. Since its inception in 1995, Manchester has been a member of the [[English Core Cities Group]],<ref name="Core city">{{Cite web|url=http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Introduction/about.html|title=About the Core Cities Group|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=[[English Core Cities Group]]|year=2004}}</ref> which, amongst other things, serves to promote the social, cultural and economic status of the city at an international level.

The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301 but lost its [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] in a court case of 1359. Until the 19th century, local government was largely provided by manorial courts, the last of which ended in 1846.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm|date=[[2003-07-31]]|title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

Manchester later formed its own [[Poor Law Union]] by the name of Manchester.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1792, commissioners&mdash;usually known as police commissioners&mdash;were established for the social improvement of Manchester. In 1838, Manchester regained its borough status, and comprised the townships of [[Beswick, Greater Manchester|Beswick]], [[Cheetham Hill]], [[Chorlton upon Medlock]] and [[Hulme]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> By 1846 the borough council had taken over the powers of the police commissioners. In 1853 Manchester was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> 

In 1885, [[Bradford, Greater Manchester|Bradford]], [[Harpurhey]], [[Rusholme]] and parts of [[Moss Side]] and [[Withington]] townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became the [[county borough]] of Manchester, separate from the [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire, and thus not governed by [[Lancashire County Council]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city from Lancashire, including former villages such as [[Burnage]], [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], [[Didsbury]], [[Fallowfield]], [[Levenshulme]], [[Longsight]], and [[Withington]]. In 1931 the [[Cheshire]] [[civil parish]]es of [[Baguley]], [[Northenden]] and Northern Etchells from the south of the [[River Mersey]] were added.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1974, by way of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the City of Manchester became a [[metropolitan district]] of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> That year, [[Ringway]], the town where Manchester Airport is located, was added to the city.

For purposes of the [[Office for National Statistics]], Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]], the United Kingdom's third largest conurbation. There is a mixture of high-density urban and suburban locations in Manchester. The largest open space in the city, at around {{convert|618|acre|km2|0}}, is [[Heaton Park]]. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with [[Cheshire]].

Manchester is home to the largest group of [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in the UK outside London. The expansion of international trade links during the industrial revolution led to the introduction of the first consuls in the 1820s and since then over 800, from all parts of the world, have been based in Manchester. Manchester has remained (in consular terms at least) the second city of the UK for two centuries, and hosts consular services for most of the north of England. The reduction in the amount of local paperwork required for modern international trade is partly offset by the increased number of international travellers. Many pass through Manchester Airport, easily the UK’s biggest and busiest airport outside the London area.<ref>{{cite book |author= Fox, David |title= Manchester Consuls |year= 2007 |publisher=Carnegie Publishing |location= Lancaster |isbn= 978-1-85936-155-9 |pages= pp.vii–ix}}<br/>•{{cite web |title= Manchester Consular Association |url=http://www.mca.group.shef.ac.uk/ |publisher=Manchester Consular Association |accessdate=2007-09-15}}<br/>•{{cite web|url=http://mca.group.shef.ac.uk/page2.html|title=List of Consulates, Consulate Generals and High Commissioners|publisher=MCA (subsidiary of Sheffield University)|accessdate=2007}}</ref>
