'''Berlin'''  is the [[Capital of Germany|capital]] city and one of sixteen [[States of Germany|states]] of [[Germany]]. With a population of 3.4 million within its city limits, Berlin is Germany's largest city. It is the second [[Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|most populous city]] and the eighth [[Largest urban areas of the European Union|most populous urban area]] in the [[European Union]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?ref_id=cmptef01103&id=18|title= Population des villes et unités urbaines de plus de 1 million d'habitants de l'Union européenne|author=[[INSEE]]|accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref> Located in northeastern Germany, it is the center of the Berlin-[[Brandenburg]] [[Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union|metropolitan area]], comprising 5 million people from over 190 nations.<ref name=LUZ>{{citeweb|url=http://www.urbanaudit.org/CityProfiles.aspx|title=City Profiles Berlin|publisher=Urban Audit|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>

First documented in the thirteenth century, Berlin was successively the capital of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (1701–1918), the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918), the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933) and the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] (1933–1945).<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/germanunification.html|title=Documents of German Unification, 1848–1871|publisher=Modern History Sourcebook|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> After [[World War II]], the city was divided; [[East Berlin]] became the capital of [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] while [[West Berlin]] became a [[West Germany|Western]] [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]], surrounded by the [[Berlin Wall]] (1961–1989).<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/62202/Berlin-Wall|title=Berlin Wall|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> Following [[German reunification]] in 1990, the city regained its status as the capital of all Germany hosting 147 foreign embassies.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.germany.info/relaunch/info/archives/background/berlin.html|title=Berlin{{ndash}} Capital of Germany|publisher=German Embassy in Washington|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.magazine-deutschland.de/en/artikel-en/article/article/das-diplomatische-berlin.html|title=Diplomatic Berlin|publisher=Deutschland Online|accessdate=2009-03-07}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Berlin}}

The name ''Berlin'', which is {{pronEng|bərˈlɪn}} in English and {{IPA-de|bɛɐˈliːn||de-Berlin.ogg}} in German, is of unknown origin, but may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' "swamp".<ref>{{citebook|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=3411062525}}</ref>

[[File:ZLB-Berliner Ansichten-Januar.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Berlin in 1688]]

The earliest evidence of settlements in today's Berlin central areas is a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192.<ref name = "zycwaq">{{citenews|publisher=Associated Press|title=Berlin dig finds city older than thought|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> The first written mention of towns in the area of present-day Berlin dates from the late twelfth century. The settlement of [[Spandau]] is first mentioned in 1197, and [[Köpenick]] in 1209, though these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.berlin.de/tourismus/sehenswuerdigkeiten.en/00175.html|title=Spandau Citadel|publisher=Berlin tourist board|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. [[Cölln]] on the [[Museum Island|Fischerinsel]] is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the [[Nikolaiviertel]], is referenced in a document from 1244.<ref name = "zycwaq"/> The former is considered to be the "founding date". From the beginning, the two cities formed an economic and [[social unit]]. In 1307, the two cities were united politically. Over time, the twin cities came to be known simply as Berlin.

In 1435, [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Elector of Brandenburg|Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html|title=The Hohenzollern Dynasty|publisher=Antipas|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> His successor, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II]], established Berlin as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of [[Prussia]], and finally as German emperors. In 1448 citizens rebelled in the “Berlin Indignation” against the construction of a new royal palace by Elector [[Frederick II, Margrave of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]]. This protest was not successful, however, and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. In 1451 Berlin became the royal residence of the Brandenburg electors, and Berlin had to give up its status as a free [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.smp-protein.de/SMPConference/berlin.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060818100934/http://www.smp-protein.de/SMPConference/berlin.htm|archivedate=2006-08-18|title=Berlin Cathedral|publisher=SMPProtein|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

===Seventeenth to nineteenth centuries===
[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick the Great]] was one of Europe's [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened monarchs]].]]

The [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648 had devastating consequences for Berlin. A third of the houses were damaged and the city lost half of its population.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/germany/bra30.html|title=Brandenburg during the 30 Years War|publisher=WHKMLA|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], known as the “Great Elector”, who had succeeded his father [[George William of Brandenburg|George William]] as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. With the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in 1685, Frederick William offered [[right of asylum|asylum]] to the French [[Huguenot]]s. More than 15,000 Huguenots went to Brandenburg, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1700, approximately twenty percent of Berlin's residents were French, and their cultural influence on the city was immense. Many other immigrants came from [[Bohemia]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], and [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]].

[[File:Berlin Unter den Linden Victoria Hotel um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years. (Unter den Linden in 1900)]]

With the coronation of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] in 1701 as king (in [[Königsberg]]), Berlin became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. In 1740 Frederick II, known as [[Frederick the Great]] (1740–1786) came to power. Berlin became, under the rule of the philosophically oriented Frederick II, a center of [[the Enlightenment]]. Following [[First French Empire|France's]] victory in the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815 the city became part of the new [[Province of Brandenburg]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the nineteenth century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main rail hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, outlying suburbs including [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Moabit]], and several others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded [[German Empire]]. On 1 April 1881 it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]] (Potsdamer Platz, 1945).]]
At the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, the [[Weimar Republic]] was proclaimed in Berlin. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] united dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into a greatly expanded city at the expense of Brandenburg. After this expansion, Berlin had a population of around four million.

On 30 January 1933 ([[Machtergreifung]]), [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] came to power. Nazi rule destroyed Berlin's [[Jewish]] community, which had numbered 170,000 before 1933. After the [[Kristallnacht]] [[pogrom]] in 1938, thousands of the city's German Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] or, in early 1943, were shipped to death camps, such as [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. During the war, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. After the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] in 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the Western Allies (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297c01.html|title=Agreement to divide Berlin|publisher=FDR-Library|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Wall]] in 1986, painted on the western side. People crossing the so-called "death strip" on the eastern side were at risk of being shot.]]

All four allies retained shared responsibility for Berlin. However, the growing political differences between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union led the latter, which controlled the territory surrounding Berlin, to impose the [[Berlin Blockade]], an economic blockade of West Berlin. The allies successfully overcame the Blockade by airlifting food and other supplies into the city from 24 June 1948 to 11 May 1949.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|publisher=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> In 1949, the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] was founded in West Germany, and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, but excluded those three countries' zones of Berlin, while the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin remained a free city that was separate from the Federal Republic of Germany, and issued its own postage stamps. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory. [[East Germany]], however, proclaimed East Berlin (which it described only as "Berlin") as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the Western powers. Although half the size and population of West Berlin, it included most of the historic center of the city. The [[West Germany|West German]] government, meanwhile, established itself provisionally in [[Bonn]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html|title=Berlin official website; History after 1945|publisher=City of Berlin|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>

The tensions between east and west culminated in the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] between East and West Berlin and other barriers around West Berlin by East Germany on 13 August 1961 and were exacerbated by a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] on 27 October 1961. West Berlin was now [[de facto]] a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.]]

Berlin was completely separated. It was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other only through strictly controlled checkpoints. For most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm|title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971|publisher=US Berlin Embassy|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

In 1989, pressure from the East German population broke free across the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, which was subsequently mostly demolished. Not much is left of it today; the [[East Side Gallery]] in [[Friedrichshain]] near the ''Oberbaumbrücke'' over the [[Spree]] preserves a portion of the Wall. Democracy and market economy changed East Germany and East Berlin.

On 3 October 1990 the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin became the German capital according to the unification treaty. In June 1991 the German Parliament, the [[Bundestag]], voted to move the (West) German capital back from [[Bonn]] to Berlin. In 1999, the [[Bundestag|German parliament]] and government began their work in Berlin.

==Geography==
[[File:Berlin.svg|thumb|Natural and built environment.]]

Berlin is located in eastern Germany, about 70&nbsp;kilometers (44&nbsp;miles) west of the border with Poland in an area with marshy terrain. The Berlin–Warsaw ''Urstromtal'' (ancient river valley), between the low Barnim plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by water flowing from melting [[ice sheet]]s at the end of the last [[ice age]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In [[Spandau]], Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree meets the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and [[Wannsee|Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k&hl=en|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

[[File:Über den Dächern von Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|View over central Berlin.]]

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim plateau, while most of the boroughs [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow plateau. The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin ''Urstromtal'' and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the [[Teufelsberg]] and the [[Müggelberge]]. Both hills have an elevation of about {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial pile of rubble from the ruins of World War II.

===Climate===
[[File:Potsdam view from above.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes]]
Berlin has a [[temperate]]/mesothermal climate (Cfb) according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system.

Summers are warm with average high temperatures of 22–25°C (mid 70s F) and lows of 12–14°C (mid 50s F). Winters are cold with average high temperatures of 4°C (upper 30s F) and lows of −2 to 0°C (upper 20s and low 30s F). Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a [[microclimate]], with heat stored by the city's buildings. Temperatures can be 4°C (7°F) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.<ref>www.weather.com</ref>

Annual precipitation is {{convert|22.4|in|mm|abbr=off|lk=off}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through March, but snow cover does not usually remain for long.<ref name=worldweather>{{citeweb|url=http://www.worldweather.org/016/c00059.htm|title=Climate figures|publisher=World Weather Information Service|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

[[File:Buddy Bear One-World Bär.JPG|thumb|100px|left|[[United Buddy Bears|Berlin's Buddy Bears]] promote tolerance and freedom]]
The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the twentieth century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin&nbsp;— the 1871 [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[East Germany]], and now the reunified [[Germany]]&nbsp;— initiated ambitious construction programs, each with its own distinctive character. Berlin was devastated by bombing raids during World War II and many of the old buildings that escaped the bombs were eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s in both West and East. Much of this destruction was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads.

In the eastern part, many ''[[Plattenbau]]ten'' can be found, reminders of [[Eastern Bloc]] ambitions to create complete residential areas with fixed ratios of shops, kindergartens and schools. The design of little red and green men on pedestrian crossing lights, the [[Ampelmännchen]], are also rather spread in Eastern parts. Berlin's unique recent history has left the city with a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings.

===Architecture===
[[File:Berlin - Haus des Lehrers & BCC.jpg|thumb|right|"Haus des Lehrers" and Congress Hall at Alexanderplatz.]]

The [[Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in Mitte is the second-tallest structure in the European Union at {{m to ft|368|precision=0}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=off}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism Style of the [[Stalin]] era. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. The previously built-up part in front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen (Berlin)|Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological scene.

[[File:Brandenburger Tor abends.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg Gate]].]]
The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division. It has recently undergone a restoration.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany. It also appears on German [[euro]] coins (10&nbsp;cent, 20&nbsp;cent, and 50&nbsp;cent). The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German [[Bundestag|Parliament]], renovated in the 1950s after severe World War II damage. The building was again remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

[[File:Potsdamerplatzberlin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Potsdamer Platz]] at dusk.]]
The [[Gendarmenmarkt]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin whose name dates back to the Napoleonic occupation of the city, is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom|French Cathedral]] with its observation platform and the German Cathedral. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

The [[Berliner Dom]], a Protestant cathedral and the third church on this site, is located on the [[Museum Island|Spree Island]] across from the site of the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]]. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier [[Prussia]]n royal family. Like many other buildings, it suffered extensive damage during the Second World War. The [[Cathedral of St. Hedwig]] is Berlin's [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] cathedral.

[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree lined east-west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former [[Berliner Stadtschloss]], and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is located there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. It combines twentieth century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the Wall came down.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html|title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990|publisher=Senate Department of Urban Development|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie (Berlin)|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmoniker|Philharmonic]]. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is situated to the north.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html?ex=1162962000&en=272335914d8b80d6&ei=5070|title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

[[File:Reichtagskuppel Berlin aufdemdach 2004.jpg|thumb|The glass dome adorning the roof of the Reichstag.]]
The area around Hackescher Markt is home to the fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche Höfe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. Oranienburger Straße and the nearby [[New Synagogue]] were the center of Jewish culture before 1933, and regains being it today.

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as central East-West-Axis. Its name commemorates the uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953. Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

[[File:Schloss Charlottenburg 2005 282.JPG|thumb|left|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] is the largest existing palace in Berlin.]]

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Near by on Tauentzienstraße is [[Kaufhaus des Westens|KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!" speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Schloss Bellevue]] is the residence of the German President. [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], which was burnt out in the Second World War and largely destroyed, has been rebuilt and is the largest surviving historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall lattice radio tower at the fair area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators, and has a restaurant {{m to ft|55|precision=0}} and an observation deck {{m to ft|126|precision=0}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

==Government==
[[File:Berlin reichstag CP.jpg|thumb|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the site of the German parliament.]]

Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is the seat of the [[President of Germany]], whose official residence is [[Schloss Bellevue]].<ref>[http://www.bundespraesident.de/en Bundespräsident Horst Köhler], www.bundespraesident.de. Retrieved 12 November 2006.</ref> Since German reunification on 3 October 1990, it has been one of the three [[city state]]s, together with [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], among the present sixteen [[states of Germany]]. The [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] ("federal council") is the representation of the Federal States (''Bundesländer'') of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian [[Herrenhaus]] (House of Lords). Though most of the ministries are seated in Berlin, some of them, as well as some minor departments, are seated in [[Bonn]], the former capital of West Germany. The [[European Union]] invests in several projects within the city of Berlin. Infrastructure, education and social programs are co-financed with budgets taken from EU cohesion funds.<ref>[http://www.erasmuspc.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=303&Itemid=61 URBAN regeneration, a European Commission initiative], ErasmusPC.

===City state===
[[File:Wowereit2008.JPG|upright|thumb|Governing Mayor since 2001, [[Klaus Wowereit]]]]

The city and state parliament is the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus''), which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's [[executive (government)|executive]] body is the Senate of Berlin (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate of Berlin consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the official title "Mayor" (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/wahlen/|title=Berlin state election, 2006|publisher=Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin|accessdate=2008-08-17}}{{de icon}}</ref>

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the city (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and Prime Minister of the Federal State (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of Berlin's Governing Mayor is in the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (Red City Hall). Since 2001 this office has been held by [[Klaus Wowereit]] of the SPD.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/050516/wowereit.html|title=The Glamor Guy|publisher=Time Europe|accessdate=2008-08-17}} See also: {{citeweb|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/world/europe/23wowereit.html?ex=1161489600&en=2129daf9965bf613&ei=5070|title=Berlin Mayor, Symbol of Openness, Has National Appeal|publisher= New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref> The city's government is based on a coalition between the Social Democratic Party and The Left.

The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2007 exceeded €20.5 ($28.7) billion including a budget surplus of €80 ($112) million. The figures indicate the first surplus in the history of the city state.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,527721,00.html Berlin schafft erstes Etatplus seit dem Krieg](German), SpiegelOnline. Retrieved February, 2008.</ref> Due to increasing growth rates and tax revenues, the Senate of Berlin calculates an increasing budget surplus in 2008.

===Boroughs===
[[File:BerlinDistricts.svg|thumb|right|Map of Berlin's twelve boroughs and their localities.]]

Berlin is subdivided into [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|twelve boroughs]] (''Bezirke''), but before [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] there were 23. Each borough is subdivided into a number of localities (''Ortsteile''), which represent the traditional [[urbanization|urbanized]] areas that inhabitants identify with. Some of these have been rearranged several times over the years. At present the city of Berlin consists of 95 such localities. The localities often consist of a number of city neighborhoods (usually called ''[[Kiez]]'' in the Berlin dialect) representing small residential areas.

Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five Councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') and a Borough Mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The Borough Council is elected by the Borough Assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities. <!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the Council of Mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), led by the city's Governing Mayor, which advises the Senate.

The localities have no government bodies of their own, even though most of the localities have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. The subsequent position of locality representative (''Ortsvorsteher'') was discontinued in favor of borough mayors.

===Sister cities===
Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/staedteverbindungen/index.en.html|title=Berlin's international city relations |publisher=Berlin Mayor's Office|accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref> [[Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, Conference of the World's Capital Cities.

==Demographics==
{{seealso|Berlin population statistics}}
[[File:Berlin Einwohnerentwicklung 1880 2006.jpg|thumb|Berlin's population 1880–2007.]]

As of December 2007, the city-state of Berlin had a population of 3,416,300 (an increase of 12,000 from 2006) registered inhabitants in an area of {{convert|891.82|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name="statoffice">{{citeweb|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/|title=Berlin statistical figures|publisher=Statistisches Landesamt Berlin|accessdate=2008-08-19}}{{de icon}}</ref> The city's population density was 3,831 inhabitants per km² (9,921/sq&nbsp;mi). The [[urban area]] of Berlin stretches beyond the city limits and comprises about 3.7&nbsp;million people while the metropolitan area of the Berlin-Brandenburg region is home to about 4.3&nbsp;million in an area of {{km2 to sq mi|5370|precision=0}}. The [[Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union|Larger Urban Zone]] comprised about five million people in an area of 17,385&nbsp;km² in the year 2004.<ref name=LUZ/><ref name="LUZ"/>

[[File:800px-PeopleMyfest.jpg|thumb|left|Crowd in [[Kreuzberg]]]]

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and a tax-free status to French [[Huguenot]] refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66&nbsp;square kilometers (25.5&nbsp;square miles) to 883 square kilometers (341&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and the population from 1.9&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million. Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin have initiated waves of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' made immigration from the former [[Soviet Union]] possible. Today ethnic [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans]] make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking population.<ref>[http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 Berlin is speaking Russians’ language]. The Russia Journal. 2001-03-10.</ref> The current decade experiences an increasing influx from various Western countries. Especially young EU-Europeans are settling in the city.

In June 2008, 473,117 residents (14.0% of the population) were of foreign nationality, hailing from 195 different countries.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/pms/2008/08-09-02.pdf|format=PDF|title=Foreign residents of Berlin|publisher=Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg|accessdate=2008-08-19}}{{de icon}}</ref>
Another 394,000 citizens (11.7%) are descendants of international migrants and have either become naturalized German citizens or obtained citizenship by virtue of birth in Germany.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/;art270,2563533|title=Jeder vierte Berliner ist ausländischer Herkunft|publisher=Der Tagesspiegel|accessdate=2008-08-19}}{{de icon}}</ref>

Berlin has two commercial airports. [[Tegel International Airport]] (TXL), the busier, and [[Schönefeld International Airport]] (SXF) handled more than 21 million passengers in 2008. Together they serve 155 destinations&nbsp; in 48 countries (summer 2009).<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/Sonderthemen;art893,2815675|title=Berlin startet durch|publisher=Tagesspiegel|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> Tegel lies within the city limits, whereas Schönefeld handles mainly low-cost-aviation and is situated just outside Berlin's south-eastern border in the state of Brandenburg.

Berlin's airport authority aims to transfer all of Berlin's air traffic in November 2011 to a newly built airport at Schönefeld, to be renamed [[Berlin Brandenburg International Airport]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/EN/BBI/|title=Airport Berlin Brandenburg International|publisher=Airports Berlin|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> City authorities aim to establish a European aviation hub with a gateway to Asia.

===Utilities===
[[File:Berlin HKW Mitte.jpg|thumb|upright|Heizkraftwerk Mitte.]]

Berlin's power supply is mainly provided by the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]] and relies more heavily than other electricity producers in Germany on [[lignite]] as an energy source. Because burning lignite produces harmful emissions, Vattenfall has announced a commitment to shift towards reliance on cleaner, [[renewable energy]] sources.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&dig=2006/05/30/a0166|title=Abgase tiefer gelegt|publisher=taz|accessdate=2008-08-18}}{{de icon}}</ref> Former West Berlin's electricity supply was provided by thermal power stations. To facilitate buffering during load peaks, [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low power consumption and unloaded during times of high consumption.

In 1993 the power connections to the surrounding areas, which had been capped in 1951, were restored. In the western districts of Berlin, nearly all power lines are underground cables; only a 380&nbsp;kV and a 110&nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] was constructed when West Berlin's electrical system was a totally independent system and not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the whole city's power system.

Carmaker [[Daimler AG]] and utility RWE AG are going to begin a joint electric car and [[charging station]] test project in Berlin called "E-Mobility Berlin."<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/3e8bc7ee811bd771be83c3bf1960bbbc.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Charité (Berlin).jpg|thumb|The [[Charité]] main building.]]

Berlin has a long tradition as a city of medicine and medical technology.<ref>{{de icon}}{{citeweb|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/magazin/wissen/Elitewettbewerb-Universitaeten;art304,2400973|title=Berlin leuchtet|publisher=Der Tagesspiegel|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> The history of medicine has been widely influenced by scientists from Berlin. [[Rudolf Virchow]] was the founder of cellular pathology, while [[Robert Koch]], discovered the anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis bacillus.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.charite.de/ch/neuro/lokales/charite/geschichte.html|title=History of the Charité of Berlin|publisher=Charite|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

The [[Charité]] hospital complex is today the largest [[university hospital]] in Europe tracing back its origins to the year 1710. The Charité is spread over four sites and comprises 3,300 beds, around 14,000 staff, 8,000 students, over 60 operating theatres with an annual turnover of over one billion euros.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.anselleurope.com/medical/index.cfm?Include=testimonials&lang=EN&I=4166|title=Customer company profile|publisher=Ansell Healthcare|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>
It is a joint institution of the [[Free University of Berlin]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], including a wide range of institutes and medical competence centers. Among them are the German Heart Center, one of the most renowned transplantation centers, the Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine and the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics. Scientific research is complemented by many industry research departments of companies such as Siemens, Schering or debis.
