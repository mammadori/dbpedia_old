Segmentation faults within preg_match_all:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a known issue with stack overflows which eventually cause
segmentation faults in the pcre library used by preg_match_all.
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40909

In order to avoid the segmantation fault, the php.ini(*) file contains
settings to limit backtracking and recursion depth:

[Pcre]
;PCRE library backtracking limit.
pcre.backtrack_limit=10000

;PCRE library recursion limit.
;Please note that if you set this value to a high number you may consume all
;the available process stack and eventually crash PHP (due to reaching the
;stack size limit imposed by the Operating System).
pcre.recursion_limit=10000

In my config, initially all settings were commented out, and instead of
10000 they were set to 100000.
Unfortunately that still caused crashes, so what is shown above is my current
config at the time of writing (it even crashed with 30000 on my system).


(*) located e.g. in /etc/php5/cli/php.ini --
locate php.ini might assist you in finding the file
