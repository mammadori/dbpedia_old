	Legitimate peripheral participation provides a lens for understanding
	participation in a community as an adaptable process that evolves
	over time. We use ideas from activity theory as a framework to describe
	our results. Finally, we describe how activity on the Wikipedia
	stands in striking contrast to traditional publishing and suggests
	a new paradigm for collaborative systems.},

	abstract = {The ability to find tables and extract information
		 from them is a necessary component of data mining,
		 question answering, and other information retrieval
		 tasks. Documents often contain tables in order to
		 communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional
		 information. Tables do this by employing layout
		 patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in
		 two-dimensional form. Their rich combination of
		 formatting and content present difficulties for
		 traditional language modeling techniques, however. This
		 paper presents the use of conditional random fields
		 (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with
		 hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support
		 the use of many rich and overlapping layout and
		 language features, and as a result, they perform
		 significantly better. We show experimental results on
		 plain-text government statistical reports in which
		 tables are located with 92\% F1, and their constituent
		 lines are classified into 12 table-related categories
		 with 94\% accuracy. We also discuss future work on
		 undirected graphical models for segmenting columns,
		 finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or
		 label cells.}
