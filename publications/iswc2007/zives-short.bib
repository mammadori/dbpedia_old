	in non-first-normal-form (NF2). Here, tuples are assigned probabilistic
	weights giving the probability that a tuple belongs to a relation.
	This way, imprecise attribute values are modelled as a probabilistic
	subrelation. For information retrieval, the set of weighted index
	terms of a document can be represented in the same way, thus supporting
	the integration of information retrieval and database systems. By
	redefining the relational operators for this type of relations,
	the result of each operator is again a probabilistic NF2 relation,
	where the weight of a tuple gives the probability that this tuple
	belongs to the result.},
