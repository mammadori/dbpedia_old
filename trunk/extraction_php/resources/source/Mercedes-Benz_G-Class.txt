The '''Mercedes-Benz G-Class''' or '''G-Wagen''', short for '''Geländewagen''' (or cross-country vehicle), is a [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle / [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV) produced by German automaker [[Mercedes-Benz]]. The [[ Shah of Iran]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], a major [[Daimler-Benz]] shareholder during his reign, proposed the development of a military vehicle in the early 1970s. A major reason to start development was the need of the [[German Army]] for a light military vehicle, but later the cheaper [[Volkswagen Iltis]] were chosen without any joint test. After a design change to a civilian cross-country vehicle in co-operation with the Austrian car manufacturer [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]],<ref>[http://mercedesgwagen.galeon.com/ Mercedes G - Puch G<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> production of the G-Class began in 1979 (the same year [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] was deposed) with the 460 Series models.<ref>[http://www.trucktrend.com/features/163_0702_mercedes_benz_g_class/g_wagen_heritage.html Mercedes G Wagen Heritage – Benz Type 463 G-Class – Luxury SUV Travel & Adventure Road Test – Truck Trend<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The G-Class has been sold under the Puch name in certain markets, and the [[Peugeot P4]] is a variant made under license, with a Peugeot engine and different parts.

Mercedes-Benz secured military contracts for the vehicle in the late 1970s and offered a civilian version in 1979. Designed to be a durable, reliable, and rugged off-roader, the G-wagen utilizes three fully [[locking differential]]s, one of the few vehicles sold in the U.S. to have such a feature, along with the [[Jeep Wrangler#TJ Wrangler Rubicon|Jeep Wrangler Rubicon]], [[Toyota Land Cruiser|Toyota 80-series Land Cruiser]], [[Pinzgauer High Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle]], and Mercedes-Benz [[Unimog]]. Among the [[engines]] offered in the G-Class for the 2004 [[model year]] is a 5.5-liter [[V8]].

In its 25th anniversary, the 2005 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG was launched again as the G55 Kompressor or G55K and improved in power, thanks to a 5.5-liter, supercharged V8 developing {{Convert|469|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Auto ft.lbf|516|0}}. of torque.

== History ==
The G-Wagen was first offered for sale in 1979 and redesigned in 1990/1991. A new version was expected for 2007, but the new GL-Class will not replace the G-Wagen, and it will continue to be hand-built in Graz, [[Austria]] at an annual production of 4,000 to 6,000 units. In February 2009, Magna Steyr, the operating unit of Magna International, announced that it signed an agreement with Daimler AG to extend the production of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class at Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria until 2015. Besides the production, the further development of the G-Class by Mercedes-Benz is also located in Graz[http://www.mercedes-benz-consult-graz.at/mbcg/0-1108-1211438-49-1213272-1-0-0-0-0-1-16209-1211430-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html].

The original [[Mercedes-Benz W460|W460]] G-Wagen went on sale for civilian buyers in the model year 1979. It was offered with two wheelbases, a short wheel base (SWB) of 2400&nbsp;mm and a long one (LWB) of 2850&nbsp;mm. One could choose between three body styles: A 2-door SWB [[convertible]], a 2-door SWB [[station wagon|wagon]] and a LWB 4-door wagon. The two wagons were also available as windowless 2-door Van (or 'Kastenwagen' in German).<br />During the G-wagens impressive life span many a different body style was made for army and public-service clients, like the Popemobile, the pickup or the chassis/cab with a wheel base of 2850, 3120 or 3400&nbsp;mm, the chassis/cab being the base vehicle for army-ambulances or communication vehicles. Because of the sheer variety of military versions, this article focuses on the more standardized civilian G-Wagen.

The W460 was popular with military and off-road enthusiasts, with more than 50,000 built in the first decade. Mercedes-Benz initially did not sell the model in the United States, but by means of "casual importation" [[grey-market]] in the mid-1980s, importers sold some G-Wagens, mostly W463s, which had been modified to meet the specifications by the [[US DOT]], at about $135,000.

=== W461 ===
The production of the W460 ended in August 1991. It was replaced by the all but identical [[Mercedes-Benz W461|W461]]. Initially, choices of engine were limited to the four-cylinder 230GE petrol and five-cylinder 290GD diesel engine. The W460 'cabrio' version was omitted. In 1997, the W461 sported a slightly updated interior with better seats, changed door panels, and an updated dash. The W461 became available only as 290GD turbo diesel with four-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The petrol engine was dropped. Disc brakes all around became standard, and the bell-housing of the front axle was changed to accommodate larger reduction gears. The exterior and other mechanics changed little, not even the model badge which kept indicating 290GD.

The main technical difference between the W460/461 and W463 model, apart from the choice of engines, gearboxes and heavy-duty suspension, is the layout of the drive train. While the W463 offers full-time 4WD, the W460/461 is basically [[rear wheel drive]] with manual 4WD. These models did not have a center differential and thus no center differential locks. Only front and rear locking differentials are needed to obtain a fully locked drive train. The front lockers were not fitted as standard, but as a factory-fitted option. The differential locks are manually operated with hydraulic levers next to the transfer case selector handle.<br />Other differences between W460/461 and W463 models are mainly cosmetic.

From the front, the W460/461 is easily recognized by its grille and headlight covers, which differ slightly from the W463 and are always black (on a factory standard car), even if the rest of the bodywork is not. If fitted, wheel arch extenders are made of unfinished plastic and are black. The rear view mirrors are mounted on the front doors instead of at the base of the A-pillar. The model badge is integrated at the base of the mirror. From the behind, the biggest differences are the fuel cap, which is not covered on the W460/461, and the arrangement of the taillights and bumpers.

Inside, whereas the W463 is very luxurious in the use of materials such as wood and leather and the layouts of electronics, the simpler model is basic, with a dash and trim which closely resemble the original vehicles in the late 1970s. Apart from the choice of rugged materials, features like [[automatic transmission]] (standard on the 290GD TD), power steering (standard on W461), ABS, drivers airbag, central locking, engine pre-heater, air conditioning (rare), heated seats and electric windows were available for the W460/461.

The G280 CDI «EDITIONPUR» is the latest W461 available for civilian buyers.  This version is essentially a civilian version of the military W461 and will come with a 24V starter motor and a walk-on bonnet.

The chassis was revised for 1990 as the [[Mercedes-Benz W463|W463]] with [[anti-lock brake]]s, full-time 4WD and a full trio of electronically-locking [[differential (mechanics)|differentials]]. The interior was totally upgraded, finished with wooden accents and optional leather upholstery.

The range was refreshed again in 1997, including the introduction of a power-topped convertible and two new engines, the 2.9&nbsp;[[Liter|L]] Turbo Diesel and the [[V6]]-powered (M112 motor) G320 — previous years' G320s were outfitted with the M104 [[straight-6|I6]]. The V8 G-wagen returned with a new engine in 1998 as the G500, with official sales beginning in the United States in 2002 at $75,000. The 349&nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] (260&nbsp;[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]]) G55 AMG cemented the vehicle in the American market with many snapped up by celebrities. The most powerful V8, the 476&nbsp;hp (355&nbsp;kW) (later {{Convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}) G55 AMG Kompressor, introduced in 2004 as model year 2005, is able to hit {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} in just 5.4 seconds. In 2005 M-B was considering that it would be the last year they would import the ''Geländewagen'' into the USA market. They even launched a "Grand Edition" (something they like to do to sell off the last of a particular model). One reason it was supposedly continued in the US market was because of an order placed for some 160+ diesel units for the US Marine Corp (H1 HumVees don't fit well in the V-22 Osprey).
<!-- MERCEDES G-WAGENS DON'T FIT EITHER -->2005 was the first year the G55 AMG model boasted 469 HP, a 120 HP increase over the '03 and '04 AMG models.

The new G550 has a 32-valve 382-horsepower 5.5-liter V8 engine, while the G55 AMG has a 500-horsepower 5.4-liter V8 engine. The G550 goes from 0 to 60mph in 6.0 seconds, while it takes the G55 AMG 4.8 seconds.

The W463 client had a larger choice of engines, the preliminary apex being the [[V8]]-powered 500 GE in 1993. They catered more of a luxury than off-road crowd with only center and rear differential locks and an even more luxurious cabin. The 500GE was produced in limited numbers for just two years. All W463 G-Wagens began using Mercedes-Benz's new letter-first naming scheme in 1994.

Various automobile tuners such as [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]], [[BRABUS]], [[LORINSER]], [[Carlsson (car company)]], German tuner A.R.T. and [[RENNtech]] have modified the engine, interior and exterior.

It was rumored that, with military contracts for the G-Class completed, production of the old G-wagen in [[Graz, Austria]] would cease in 2006. However, reports state that production of the current G-wagen will continue for the foreseable future, alongside its once-intended replacement, the [[Mercedes-Benz GL-Class|GL-Class]] (X164). An outcry among enthusiasts who admired the G-Class for its tremendous off-road potential showed that a market still existed for such a vehicle. Mercedes-Benz elected to continue G-Class production for the hardcore off-road market, while the larger 3-row GL-Class would be marketed as a competitor for the likes of the [[Cadillac Escalade]] and [[Lincoln Navigator]].

'''The Ultimate G - The 2009 Mercedes-Benz G55 G V12 S Biturbo'''
[[File:Brabus G V12 Biturbo.jpg|thumb|left|Brabus G V12 Biturbo]]
[[File:Brabus G V12 Biturbo rear.jpg|thumb|right|Brabus G V12 Biturbo]]
The world’s most powerful G off-roader is modified by the tuner BRABUS. It is built on the latest Mercedes G-Class. The SUV is powered by a BRABUS SV12 S displacement engine. Like all special models of BRABUS - recognized by the German Vehicle Registration Agency as a vehicle manufacturer - the BRABUS G V12 S Biturbo comes with a comprehensive luxury package. The ultra-powerful 4×4 starts at 379,000 Euros. None have been sold to the USA. 

The BRABUS SV12 S engine is based on the V12 Bi-turbo engine from Mercedes S 600. Before being implanted in the engine bay of the G-Class, displacement of the three-valve engine is increased from 5.5 to 6.3 liters (336 to 384 cubic inches) using a special crankshaft with longer stroke, larger cylinders and larger bore. In addition, the cylinder heads are re-machined and fitted with special camshafts.

'''Manufacturing contracts with Daimler AG have been renewed for the continued production of Mercedes-Benz's G-Class at Magna Steyr's facilities in Graz, Austria, until 2015.''' The G-Class is produced in three, five-door, convertible and in custom versions. The Magna International division in Graz has made about 200,000 vehicles over 30 years.
