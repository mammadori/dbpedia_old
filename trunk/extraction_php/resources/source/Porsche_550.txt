The '''Porsche 550''' was a [[sports car]] produced by [[Porsche]] from 1953-1956. 

Inspired by the Porsche 356 which was created by Ferry Porsche, and some [[spyder]] prototypes built and raced by [[Walter Glöckler]] starting in 1951, the factory decided to build a car designed for use in [[auto racing]].<ref name="Porsche_legends">{{cite book |author=Leffingwell, Randy |title=Porsche legends |publisher=MBI Pub.

In fact, former [[Germany|German]] [[Formula One]] racer [[Hans Herrmann]] drove it [http://www.solitude-memorial.de/id15carrera.htm under closed railroad crossing gates] during the 1954 [[Mille Miglia]].

The 550 / 1500RS or Spyder became known as the "Giant Killer", and gave Porsche its first overall win in a major [[sports car racing]] event, the 1956 [[Targa Florio]].

Its successor from 1957 onwards, the [[Porsche 718]], was even more successful, scoring points in [[Formula One]] as late as 1963. A descendant of the Porsche 550 is generally considered to be the [[Porsche Boxster]] S 550 Spyder; the Spyder name was effectively resurrected with the [[Porsche RS Spyder|RS Spyder]] Le Mans Prototype.

The Porsche 550 ''"Little Bastard"'' is best known for being the car in which [[James Dean]] was killed on September 30, 1955.<ref name=StAntoine-MT>St. Antoine, Arthur. - [http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/c12_0511_dean_jeffries_interview/index.html "Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend"]. - ''[[Motor Trend|Motor Trend Magazine]]''</ref>

The 550 is among the most frequently reproduced classic automobiles, like the [[AC Cobra]] and [[Lotus Seven]]. Several companies have sprung up in the last 25 years, some of which build near-exact replicas from the ground up, including spaceframes built to exacting specs from Porsche blueprints. Some of the companies that make replicas are [http://www.boulderspeedster.com Boulder Speedster], [http://www.chuckbeckmotorsports.com/ Chuck Beck Motorsports], [http://www.automotivelegends.com Automotive Legends], [http://www.chamonixcars.com.br/ Chamonix do Brasil], [http://www.thunderranch.com/ Thunder Ranch], [http://www.holmesmotor.co.uk// Holmes Motor Company], [http://www.550spyder.co.nz/  Le Mans 550 Spyder], [http://www.vintagespyders.com/ Vintage Spyders], and [http://www.alloycars.com/ Alloycars], which specializes in exact aluminum re-creations from blueprints.
