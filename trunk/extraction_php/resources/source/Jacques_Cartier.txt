'''Jacques Cartier''' (December 31, 1491 – September 1, 1557) was a French [[explorer]] who claimed what is now [[Canada]] for [[France]].<ref name="CanEn-Cartier">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0001439|title=Cartier, Jacques|last=Trudel|first=Marcel|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref><ref name="EB-Cartier">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97444/Jacques-Cartier|title=Jacques Cartier|publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica|accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref><ref name="Histori.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10123|title=Exploration - Jacques Cartier|publisher=The Historica Dominion Institute|accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref><ref name="Catholic-Cartier">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03392b.htm|title=Jacques Cartier|publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref> He was the first European to describe and map<ref>His maps are lost but referred to in a letter by his nephew Jacques Noël, dated 1587 and printed by [[Richard Hakluyt]] with the ''Relation'' of Cartier's third voyage, in ''The Principall Navigations [...], London, G.

==Biography==
Jacques Cartier was born in 1491<ref>No baptismal certificate has been found, but Cartier stated his age on at least three letters. See Marcel Trudel, ''Histoire de la Nouvelle-France'', vol. 1, p. 68.</ref> in [[Saint-Malo]], the port on the extreme north-east coast of [[Brittany]]. Cartier, who was a respectable mariner, improved his social status in 1520 by marrying Mary Catherine des Granches, member of a leading family. His good name in Saint-Malo is recognized by its frequent appearance on baptismal registers as godfather or witness.<ref>Biggar, H.P. ''A Collection of Documents relating to Jacques Cartier and the Sieur de Roberval'', Ottawa, Public Archives of Canada, 1930. Over 20 baptisms cited.</ref> 

===First voyage, 1534===
In 1534, the year the [[Duchy of Brittany]] was formally united with France in the [[Union between Brittany and France|Edict of Union]], Cartier was introduced to King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] by [[Jean le Veneur]], [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] of Saint-Malo and [[abbot]] of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], at the [[Manoir de Brion]]. The king had previously invited (although not formally commissioned) the [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] to explore the eastern coast of North America on behalf of France in 1524. Cartier is believed to have accompanied da Verrazzano on this expedition, which explored the coast from [[South Carolina]] to [[Nova Scotia]], and islands such as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]; on another voyage they went to [[Brazil]]. Le Veneur cited these voyages to Newfoundland and Brazil as proof of Cartier's ability to "lead ships to the discovery of new lands in the New World".<ref>Baron de La Chapelle, « Jean Le Veneur et le Canada », Nova Francia, vol. 6, 1931, pp. 341-343, quoting a genealogical work made in 1723 for the Le Veneur family. After his final trip, he said he would never search again.</ref>

[[File:Cartier First Voyage Map 1.png|thumb|left|Route of Cartier's first voyage.]]
In 1534, Cartier set sail under a commission from the king, hoping to discover a [[Northwest Passage|western passage]] to the wealthy markets of Asia. In the words of the commission, he was to "discover certain islands and lands where it is said that a great quantity of gold and other precious things are to be found". It took him twenty days to sail across the ocean. Starting on May 10 of that year, he explored parts of Newfoundland, the areas now the Canadian Atlantic provinces and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. During one stop at Îles aux Oiseaux (Islands of the Birds, now the Rochers-aux-Oiseaux federal [[bird sanctuary]], northeast of [[Brion Island]] in the [[Magdalen Islands]]), his crew slaughtered around 1000 birds, most of them [[great auk]]s (now extinct). Cartier's first two encounters with [[aboriginal peoples in Canada]] on the north side of [[Chaleur Bay]], most likely the [[Mi'kmaq]], were brief; some trading occurred. His third encounter took place on the shores of [[Gaspé Bay]] with a party of [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]], where on July 24, he planted a 10 meter cross bearing the words "Long Live the King of France" and took possession of the territory in the name of the king. The change in mood was a clear indication that the Iroquoians understood Cartier's actions. Here he kidnapped the two sons of their captain.<ref>Some accounts make this captain to be Donnacona himself, the ruler at Stadacona, eg. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002354 the Canadian Encyclopedia], but this does not seem possible from Cartier's firsthand accounts.</ref> Cartier wrote  that they later told him this region where they were captured (Gaspé) was called by them ''Honguedo''. The natives' captain at last agreed that they could be taken, under the condition that they return with European goods to trade.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=107 [[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Cartier returned to France in September 1534, sure that he had reached an Asian coast.

===Second voyage, 1535–1536===


Jacques Cartier set sail for a second voyage on May 19 of the following year with three ships, 110 men, and the two natives. Reaching the St. Lawrence, he sailed up-river for the first time, and reached the Iroquoian capital of [[Stadacona]], where Chief [[Donnacona]] ruled.

Jacques Cartier left his main ships in a harbour close to Stadacona, and used his smallest ship to continue up-river and visit [[Hochelaga (village)|Hochelaga]] (now Montreal) where he arrived October 2, 1535. Hochelaga was far more impressive than the small and squalid village of Stadacona, and more than 1,000 Iroquoians came to the river edge to greet the Frenchmen. The site of their arrival has been confidently identified as the beginning of the [[Sainte-Marie Sault]] - where the [[Jacques Cartier Bridge|bridge named after him]] now stands.  The expedition could proceed no further, as the river was blocked by rapids.  So certain was Cartier that the river was the [[Northwest Passage]] and that the rapids were all that was preventing him from sailing to [[China]], that the rapids and the town that eventually grew up near them came to be named after the French word for China, ''La Chine'': the [[Lachine Rapids]] and the town of [[Lachine, Quebec]].

After spending two days among the people of Hochelaga, Cartier returned to Stadacona on October 11. It is not known exactly when he decided to spend the winter of 1535-1536 in Stadacona, and it was by then too late to return to France. Cartier and his men prepared for the winter by strengthening their fort, stacking firewood, and [[Salting (food)|salting down]] [[Salt-cured meat|game]] [[saltfish|and fish]].

During this winter, Cartier compiled a sort of gazetteer that included several pages on the manners of the natives -- in particular, their habit of wearing only leggings and [[loincloth]]s even in the dead of winter....{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

[[File:Cartier Second Voyage Map 1.png|thumb|right|Route of Cartier's second voyage.]]
From mid-November 1535 to mid-April 1536, the French fleet lay frozen solid at the mouth of the [[Saint-Charles River|St. Charles River]], under the Rock of Quebec. Ice was over a [[fathom]] (1.8 m) thick on the river, with snow four feet (1.2 m) deep ashore. To add to the discomfort, [[scurvy]] broke out -- first among the Iroquoians, and then among the French. In his journal, Cartier states that by mid-February, "out of 110 that we were, not ten were well enough to help the others, a pitiful thing to see". Cartier estimated the number of natives dead at 50.

One of the natives who survived was Dom Agaya, the chief's son who had been taken to France the previous year. During a friendly visit by Domagaya to the French fort, Cartier enquired and learned from him that a concoction made from a tree known as [[aneda|annedda]] (probably ''[[Thuja occidentalis|arbor vitae]]'') would cure scurvy. This remedy likely saved the expedition from destruction, allowing 85 Frenchmen to survive the winter.

Ready to return to France in early May 1536, Cartier decided to take Chief Donnacona to France, so that he might personally tell the tale of a country further north, called the "[[Kingdom of Saguenay]]", said to be full of gold, rubies and other treasures. After an arduous trip down the St. Lawrence and a three-week Atlantic crossing, Cartier and his men arrived in Saint-Malo on July 15, 1536, concluding the second, 14 month voyage, which was to be Cartier's most profitable.

===Third voyage, 1541–1542===
On October 17, 1540, Francis I ordered the Breton navigator to return to Canada to lend weight to a colonization project of which he would be "captain general". However, January 15, 1541 saw Cartier supplanted by [[Jean-François de La Rocque de Roberval]], a [[Huguenot]] courtier and friend of the king named as the first [[Lieutenant General of New France|lieutenant general of French Canada]]. Roberval was to lead the expedition, with Cartier as his chief navigator. While Roberval waited for artillery and supplies, he gave permission to Cartier to sail on ahead with his ships.

On May 23, 1541, Cartier departed Saint-Malo on his third voyage with five ships. This time, any thought of finding a passage to the Orient was forgotten. The goals were now to find the "Kingdom of Saguenay" and its riches, and to establish a permanent settlement along the St. Lawrence River.

Anchoring at Stadacona, Cartier again met the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|Iroquoians]], but found their "show of joy" and their numbers worrisome, and decided not to build his settlement there. Sailing a few miles up-river to a spot he had previously observed, he decided to settle on the site of present-day [[Cap-Rouge]], Quebec. The convicts and other colonists were landed, the cattle that had survived three months aboard ship were turned loose, earth was broken for a kitchen garden, and seeds of cabbage, turnip, and lettuce were planted. A fortified settlement was thus created and was named [[Charlesbourg-Royal]]. Another fort was also built on the cliff overlooking the settlement, for added protection.

The men also began collecting what they believed to be diamonds and gold, but which upon return to France were discovered to be merely quartz crystals and [[iron pyrites]], respectively - which gave rise to a French expression: "''faux comme les diamants du Canada''" ("As false as Canadian diamonds"). Two of the ships were dispatched home with some of these minerals on September 2.

Having set tasks for everyone, Cartier left with the longboats for a reconnaissance in search of "Saguenay" on September 7. Having reached Hochelaga, he was prevented by bad weather and the numerous rapids from continuing up to the [[Ottawa River]].

Returning to Charlesbourg-Royal, Cartier found the situation ominous. The Iroquoians no longer made friendly visits or peddled fish and game, but prowled about in a sinister manner. No records exist about the winter of 1541-1542 and the information must be gleaned from the few details provided by returning sailors. It seems the natives attacked and killed about 35 settlers before the Frenchmen could retreat behind their fortifications. Even though scurvy was cured through the native remedy ([[Thuja occidentalis]] infusion), the impression left is of a general misery, and of Cartier's growing conviction that he had insufficient manpower either to protect his base or to go in search of the Saguenay Kingdom.

Cartier left for France in early June 1542, encountering Roberval and his ships along the Newfoundland coast, at about the time Roberval marooned [[Marguerite de La Rocque]]. Despite Roberval's insistence that he accompany him back to Saguenay, Cartier slipped off under the cover of darkness and continued on to France, still convinced his vessels contained a wealth of gold and diamonds. He arrived there in October, in what proved to be his last voyage. Meanwhile, Roberval took command at Charlesbourg-Royal, but it was abandoned in 1543 after disease, foul weather and hostile natives drove the would-be settlers to despair.

===Later life===
Cartier spent the rest of his life in Saint-Malo and his nearby estate, where he often was useful as an interpreter in [[Portuguese language|Portugese]], and he died aged 65 or 66 on September 1, 1557 from an epidemic.<ref>[http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/qc/cartierbrebeuf/natcul/natcul2_e.asp Parks Canada - Cartier-Brébeuf National Historic Site of Canada - Natural Wonders & Cultural Treasures - Jacques Cartier, Explorer and Navigator<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> No permanent European settlements were made in Canada before 1608, when [[Samuel Champlain]] founded [[Quebec City]]. Cartier is interred in St. Vincent's Cathedral.

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Dauphin Map of Canada - circa 1543 - Project Gutenberg etext 20110.jpg|thumb|The ''Dauphin Map'' of Canada, circa 1543, showing Cartier's discoveries]]

Having already located the entrance to the St. Lawrence on his first voyage, he now opened up the greatest waterway for the European penetration of North America. He produced an intelligent estimate of the resources of Canada, both natural and human, albeit with a considerable exaggeration of its mineral wealth. While some of his actions toward the St. Lawrence Iroquoians were dishonourable, he did try at times to establish friendship with them and other native peoples living along the St. Lawrence River -- an indispensable preliminary to French settlement in their lands.

Cartier was the first to document the name [[Canada's name|Canada]] to designate the territory on the shores of the St-Lawrence River. The name is derived from the [[Huron]]-[[Iroquois]] word "kanata", or village, which was incorrectly interpreted as the native term for the newly discovered land.<ref>McMullen, J.M. 1855. [http://books.google.com/books?id=YTElAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR7#PRA1-PA7,M1 ''The History of Canada: From Its First Discovery to the Present Time'']. C. W., J. M'Mullen (no copyright in the United States), p. 7. No ISBN.</ref> Cartier used the name to describe Stadacona, the surrounding land and the river itself. And Cartier named "''Canadiens''" the inhabitants ([[Iroquoian]]s) he had seen there. Thereafter the name Canada was used to designate the small French colony on these shores, and the French colonists were called ''Canadiens'', until the mid-nineteenth century, when the name started to be applied to the loyalist colonies on [[Great Lakes|the Great Lakes]] and later to all of [[British North America]]. In this way Cartier is not strictly the European discoverer of Canada as this country is understood today, a vast federation stretching [[Coat of Arms of Canada|''a mari usque ad mare'']] (from sea to sea). Eastern parts had previously been visited by the Norse, as well as Basque, Galician and Breton fishermen, and perhaps the [[Corte-Real]] brothers and [[John Cabot]] (in addition of course to the Natives who first inhabited the territory). Cartier's particular contribution to the discovery of Canada is as the first European to penetrate the continent, and more precisely the interior eastern region along the St. Lawrence River. His explorations consolidated France's claim of the territory that would later be colonized as [[New France]], and his third voyage produced the first documented European attempt at settling North America since that of [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]] in 1526-27. 

Cartier's professional abilities can be easily ascertained. Considering that Cartier made three voyages of exploration in dangerous and hitherto unknown waters without losing a ship, and that he entered and departed some 50 undiscovered harbors without serious mishap, he may be considered one of the most conscientious explorers of the period.

Cartier was also one of the first to formally acknowledge that the New World was a separate land mass from Europe/Asia.

==Rediscovery of Cartier's first colony==
On August 18, 2006, Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]] announced that Canadian archaeologists had discovered the precise location of Cartier's lost first colony of [[Charlesbourg-Royal]].<ref>[http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=edd7eac6-f566-4011-87d7-82becfc883a2&k=48975 canada.com]</ref> The colony was built where the Cap Rouge river runs into the St. Lawrence River and is based on the discovery of burnt wooden timber remains that have been dated to the mid-16th century, and a fragment of a decorative Istoriato plate manufactured in [[Faenza]], Italy, between 1540 and 1550, that could only have belonged to a member of the French aristocracy in the colony. Most probably this was the [[Jean-François de la Roque de Roberval|Sieur de Roberval]], who replaced Cartier as the leader of the settlement.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4978e603-f67e-4784-807d-7f3911c60829&k=27303 canada.com]</ref> This colony was the first known European settlement in modern day Canada since the c.1000 AD [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] Viking village in northern [[Newfoundland island|Newfoundland]]. Its rediscovery has been hailed by archaeologists as the most important find in Canada since the L'Anse aux Meadows rediscovery.

== Popular references ==
In 2005, Cartier's ''Bref récit et succincte narration de la navigation faite en MDXXXV et MDXXXVI'' was named the most important book in Canadian history by the ''[[Literary Review of Canada]]''.

Jacques Cartier Island, located on the tip of the [[Great Northern Peninsula]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in the town of [[Quirpon, Newfoundland and Labrador|Quirpon]], is said to have been named by Jacques Cartier himself on one of his voyages through the [[Straits of Belle Isle]] during the 1530s.

[[The Tragically Hip]] reference Jacques Cartier in their song "Looking for a Place to Happen." The song deals with primitivism and colonialism in the context of European ideologies and mythic exploration narratives in line with Cartier's journey's to the "New World."
