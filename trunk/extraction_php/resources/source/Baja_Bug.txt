The term '''Baja Bug''' generally refers to an original [[Volkswagen Beetle]] modified to operate off-road (open desert, sand dunes and beaches), although other versions of [[air-cooled]] Volkswagens are sometimes modified as well.

==History==
Baja Bugs originated in [[Southern California]] in the late 1960s as an inexpensive answer to the successful, Volkswagen-based [[Dune buggy|dune buggies]] of the mid-1960s, especially the [[Meyers Manx]].
The building of the first Baja Bug is generally credited to Gary Emory of Parts Obsolete circa 1968. The first Baja Bug in racing is credited to Dave Deal, the famous Californian cartoonist, in the Mexican 1000 of 1968. The first fiberglass baja kit (bug eye kit) was not introduced until 1969 by the Miller-Havens company.
In the early days before fiberglass body panels became available, enthusiast and racers simply made their own modification to both the body and mechanicals of a stock VW to develop a machine suited to harsh, off-road environments.  The metal fenders and front and rear aprons of the car would be partially cut away to allow more for ground clearance and suspension travel. This came to be know as a "cut baja". More engine power was attained by fitting dual port heads and modifying fuel injection systems from [[VW Type 3]] cars to work on the Type 1 Beetle engine.

==Why the Beetle?==
The Beetle was popular in less-developed areas of the world because of its rear-mounted [[air-cooled]] engine, flat floorpan, and rugged [[torsion bar]] suspension.  In fact, advertising of the period touted the fact that the Beetle was so watertight that it floated.  Those same attributes made the Beetle the perfect choice for the basis of an off-road vehicle as evidenced by the car's success both then and now in the [[Baja 1000]] off-road race.

==Conversion==
Basic modifications are simple. A lightweight, shortened [[fiberglass]] front body panel is fitted after the sheetmetal from the trunklid edge forward and rear engine decklid and everything rearward (rear apron and engine compartment) is removed.  The rear treatment leaves the engine totally exposed to aid in cooling.  A tubular steel cage front and rear bumper is fitted to the body and floorpan for protection of engine and occupants.  Shortened fiberglass fenders both front and rear meant removal of the Beetle's distinctive running boards and the likely addition of more tubular steel parts (side bars) in their place.  The rugged torsion bar front and rear suspension standard on the Beetle, allows it to withstand the rigors of offroading and the rear ride height to easily be raised slightly and stiffened to make clearance for larger heavy-duty off-road tires and wheels. The taller sidewall tires provide more flexible ride comfort and rocky road ground clearance. The Beetle suspension "stops" can be moved to allow more suspension travel. Longer [[shock absorber]]s for the increase in suspension travel, provide more dampening control over bumps giving more driver control and comfort. Some people even get rid of the torsion bar suspension and install coilover-type springs that mount to a roll cage, allowing extreme amounts of travel with a very comfortable ride.

==The Baja Bug today==
Though Baja Bugs have been greatly supplanted in recent years by tube-framed, purpose-built buggies known as [[sand rail]]s, due to the slowly dwindling supply of suitable donor cars, they remain a popular choice in desert regions as few beaches in the US are open to vehicular traffic.  Many are fitted with highly modified Volkswagen engines and a few home-built hybrids have [[Ford Pinto engine]], [[Chevrolet Corvair]], [[Porsche]], [[Mazda]], [[Subaru]] or other four- to eight-cylinder water-cooled engines.  Customized roadgoing Baja Bugs remain fairly popular as well.

Recently, Volkswagen has attempted a revival of the Baja Bug with the Dune concept in 2000.
