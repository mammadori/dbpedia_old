The '''Volkswagen New Compact Sedan''' (codenamed NCS) is a new [[sedan (car)|sedan]] that will be larger than the current fifth generation [[Volkswagen Jetta]], but priced in the range of the [[Toyota Corolla]] and [[Honda Civic]]. Stefan Jacoby, CEO of Volkswagen's North American division, confirmed that the NCS will wear the "Jetta" moniker.<ref>{{cite news

==Market==
The vehicle will be targeted primarily at the [[North America]]n market and is part of Volkswagen's strategy to boost sales in the region to 800,000 per year. The NCS will be based on a re-enhanced current fifth generation Volkswagen Jetta platform. Volkswagen expects to sell 160,000 of these vehicle per year. The NCS will be available in 2010 in the US market as a 2011 model.<ref>{{cite news

==Design==
The NCS is being developed with strict cost-cutting goals to bring it into the base price range of the Toyota Corolla. This translates to the vehicle losing much of the interior refinement and detail that are standard in the current line of Volkswagen sedans. The new sedan will feature the 2.5L, 5-cylinder engine that is currently found in the MkV Jetta. However, it is anticipated that optional 2.0L TSI and 2.0L TDI engines will be available as well. Other options that may become available on the NCS are AWD, dual-clutch transmissions (in lieu of the automatic gearbox), and a 1.4L TSI engine.

==Production==
The NCS will be produced at Volkswagen's production facility in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla, Mexico]] alongside the second generation [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]] and a 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] version of the [[Volkswagen Polo Mk5|fifth generation Volkswagen Polo]].<ref>[http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/vw_audi_central/upcoming_volkswagen_models_lineup_to_get_less_german_car_news Upcoming Volkswagen Models, Lineup to get Less German], Retrieved 30-5-09</ref>
