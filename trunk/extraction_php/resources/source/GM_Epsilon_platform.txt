'''Epsilon''' is [[General Motors]]' new [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[front-wheel drive]] [[automobile platform]]. The architecture debuted in the 2002 [[Opel Vectra#Vectra C|Opel Vectra]] and 2003 [[Saab 9-3]]. Since this platform falls squarely in the center of the worldwide automobile market, GM plans to produce a great many Epsilon vehicles with over a dozen variations. {{As of|2005}}, it is GM's highest volume worldwide platform. Even after the dissolution of the GM/[[Fiat]] partnership, both companies retain the rights to continue developing Epsilon-derived models.

==Features==

GM's '''Epsilon''' platform replaced the [[GM N platform|N platform]] in the [[United States|US]], and replaced the [[GM2900 platform]] elsewhere. Vehicles of this platform generally carry the symbol "Z" in the fourth digit of their [[Vehicle Identification Number|VINs]].

When the platform debuted, there was talk of an "Epsilon Wide" derivative, which was supposed to have provided the underpinnings for the [[Buick LaCrosse]] and [[Saab 9-5]]. However, the program was cancelled and the LaCrosse was put on the [[GM W platform|W platform]], and the 9-5 was given a quick refresh for the 2006 model year.

Many of the Epsilon vehicles use the [[GM Family II engine|Ecotec Family II]] [[straight-4|I4]] engines and both the [[GM High Value engine|High Value]] and [[GM High Feature engine|High Feature]] V6 engines.

The refreshed 2008 SAAB 9-3 debuted with an advanced version of all-wheel-drive it dubbed XWD, finally giving a definitive answer to rumors about the platform's ability to support AWD, which had been around since the debut of the platform.

The [[GM Lambda platform|Lambda]] and [[GM Theta platform#Theta_Premium|Theta Premium]] [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] platforms are derived from Epsilon.
