The '''V3''' [[automobile platform]] is the first generation of [[BMW]]'s [[Progressive_Activity_Vehicles#Progressive_activity_coupe_.28PAC.29|Progressive Activity Coupe (PAC)]] series. The concept is expected to be debuted at the upcoming 2009 Frankfurt Autoshow as a Concept 3 Series Gran Turismo (3 GT). The V3 is meant to appeal to [[BMW]] customers looking for a smaller sportier version of the [[BMW V5|V5]]. The V3 is expected to be based on a longer wheelbase 3 series with higher roof than the standard wagon.<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/artikel/auto-bild-48_2008_811218.html German magazine AutoBild article on the V3/3 GT]</ref>
