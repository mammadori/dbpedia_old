The '''BMW New Class''' (German: ''Neue Klasse'') was a line of compact [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s and coupes produced by German automaker [[BMW]] starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977.

Powered by BMW's celebrated [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] [[BMW M10|M10]] engine, the New Class models featured a fully [[independent suspension]], [[MacPherson strut]]s in front, and front disc brakes. Initially a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the '''02 Series''' 1600 and 2002 in 1966.

Sharing little in common with the rest the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW [[3 Series]], the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker.

New Class four-doors with numbers ending in "0" were replaced by the larger [[BMW 5 Series]] in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] [[BMW E9]], introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, the 2002 replaced by the 320i in 1975.

Introduced in September 1961 at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], the 1500 was produced from 1962 through 1966. 

Contemporary reports praised the all-round visibility and the commanding driving position while recording that it was necessary to lean forward a little to engage first and third gears due to the long travel distance of the gear lever<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200302/>.   The large 40&nbsp;cm tall luggage compartment was also commended<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200302/>.

In 1963, the nearly bankrupt BMW was able to pay its first dividend in 20 years due to increased sales thanks to the popularity of the 1500. It was able to achieve {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and to accelerate to {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in approximately 15 seconds<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200302/>. The performance was at the time considered lively in view of the engine size, and although the engine needed to be worked hard in order to achieve rapid progress, the engine ran smoothly and without gratuitous vibration even at speeds above 6,000 rpm<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200302/>.   The firm suspension and correspondingly harsh ride came as a surprise to those conditioned by the [[BMW 501]] to anticipate a more comfort oriented compromise in the handling/smoothness balance<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200302/>.

The 1961 1500 was the first car to feature the [[Hofmeister kink]] in the C-pillar.

It was replaced in 1964 by the BMW 1600, but it was still made available in markets where higher capacity engines meant increased taxation.

The BMW 1800 was the second member of the New Class family, introduced in 1963 with a {{convert|90|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.8&nbsp;L engine. An 1800TI ('touring international') model featured components developed for the 1800 by the tuning company Alpina. The upgrades included dual [[Solex]] PHH side-draft [[carburetor]]s and higher-compression pistons for {{convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. A racing 1800TI/SA was introduced in 1964 with dual [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] DCOE-45 carburetors (along with various engine modifications) with {{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. 200 examples of the TI/SA were built.

An [[automatic transmission]] option was introduced in 1966 and in 1967 the 1800 was generally updated along with the 2000. The updates included interior changes (a modernized dashboard design and simpler door panels) as well as styling changes to the front grilles.

The 1600, introduced in 1964, used the pistons from the 1800 to enlarge the 1500s engine to 1.6&nbsp;L (1573&nbsp;cc) and {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It replaced that smaller model in 1964 and was produced through 1968.

The 02 Series two-door sports sedans came into being at the prompting of US importer Max Hoffman, who convinced BMW that a more attractive 2-door version of the 1500 would sell much better than that decidedly Teutonic [[sedan (car)|sedan]] had thus far. BMW agreed and turned to Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti, noted for such successes as the [[Triumph Spitfire]] and [[Triumph TR4|TR4]], for a design.

The 02 Series that resulted bears little in common with the 1500 sedan save running gear. A two-door 1600 (also known as a 1600-2 or 1602) made its debut at the Geneva auto show in 1966<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2002registry.com/history/index.htm |title=History |publisher=2002registry.com |date=1966-03-09 |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref> and was sold through 1975. Power output of the M10 was up to {{convert|96|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} gross with {{convert|91|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. Within two years ''[[Road & Track]]'' was sufficiently impressed by the $2676 (US) 1968 1600 to call it "a great automobile at the price".

A limited-production [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] was produced by [[Baur]] from 1967 through 1971, and a 2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] version, the 1600ti, featured the dual Solex PHH side-draft carburetors (as found on the 1800TI) and {{convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for 1967 and 1968.  A [[hatchback]] 1600 Touring model was produced in 1971 and 1972.

Featuring a modern [[coupe]] body by [[Karmann]] and a luxurious interior, the {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} single-carburetor 2000C and {{convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} dual-carburetor 2000CS were sold from 1965 through 1969. 'C' versions were available with a [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox or an automatic while 'CS' versions were only available with a manual gearbox. The coupe's styling was very controversial due to the design of its front grilles and headlights. The front of the coupe was completely changed in 1969 with the introduction of the 2800CS by modeling it after the 2500 and 2800 sedans.

The "regular" 100&nbsp;hp 2000 [[sedan (car)|sedan]] appeared a year after the 2000C. It was sold from 1966 through 1972. Intended as an upscale version of the 1800, the 2000 featured distinct wide taillights, more extrior trim, and unique rectangular headlights. The American market 2000 sedans could not have the rectangular headlights due to government regulations. A different grille with four individual round headlights, similar to the design that BMW later used in the 2500 sedan, was offered in the US.

A 2000TI model, similar to the 1800TI, was built with twin [[Solex]] side-draft [[carburetor]]s with {{convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. However, the 2000TI retained the '1800' taillights and headlights. A more luxurious 2000tilux featured the sporty TI engine, a wood dashboard, and optional leather seats. In a 1967 test, ''[[Road & Track]]'' felt that the 2000 sedan was "the best performing 2-liter sedan in today's market and the best handling and best riding as well." The 'tilux produced {{convert|135|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} gross.

Finally, the 2000tii ('touring international, injected') was BMW's first fuel-injected model, featuring a higher-compression 2.0L engine and Kugelfischer brand mechanical fuel injection that later found its way into the 2002 Turbo and other models. 1,922 2000tii cars were built of this final New Class sedan model.

The 2002 is one of BMW's most famous automobile models. While the 1500 had begun BMW's reputation for sports sedans, the 2002 may be considered its ultimate incarnation.

A two liter version of the Michelotti-designed two-door 1600, it cemented the company's reputation for compact sporting sedans and served as both forerunner of the BMW 3 Series and inspiration for the new 1 Series Coupe.

With its 1990 cc engine, it produced {{convert|108|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the 2002ti, and {{convert|130|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the high-performance [[BMW 2002tii|2002tii]], offering a top speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. Although almost exactly the same in appearance the Tii had slightly larger wheels, larger front brakes, and a number of other mechanical modifications that made the car more fun and more desirable as a collector car. One unfortunate result is that many of the highly desirable"tii"s appearing on Ebay and sold throughout the country are fake. Potential buyers need to carefully review the car and the some of internet sites devoted to the tii to ensure they are getting what they pay for. It is not uncommon to see tii engines installed in standard 2002s because there is a dramatic price difference between two cars. The 2002 Turbo was launched at the 1973 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. BMW's first production [[turbocharging|turbo]], it produced {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,800 rpm, with {{convert|240|Nm|lbÂ·ft|abbr=on}} of torque.

A three-door 2002, the Touring, was also available. The Touring was not a full [[station wagon]], resembling a modern [[hatchback]]. BMW would not offer a Touring model again until the late 1980s, with the 3 Series. A cabriolet version was produced in small numbers by [[Baur]] of Germany, which to this day as IVM Automotive, continues to convert BMWs. This version was never sold in the United States although a number were brought in by dipolmatic staff, and recently they can be imported so more have come over.

==1502 and 1802==
An economy model of the 2002, the 1502 had a low compression 1.6 L engine.&nbsp; It was sold only in Europe from 1975 through 1977. The 1802, a 2002 with a 1.8 L motor as used in the 1800 sedan, was also available.

==In popular culture==
A BMW New Class was used as the taxi for shuttling sportcaster [[Jim McKay]] to the Olympic Village during the terrorist attacks of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich while the area was under lockdown, and was driven by a reckless chaffeur while Jim McKay was in the vehicle, and was totaled later in the day when the chaffeur was running an errand.
