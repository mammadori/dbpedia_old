In [[internal combustion engine]]s, '''gasoline direct injection''' is a variant of [[fuel injection]] employed in modern [[two-stroke cycle|two-]] and [[four-stroke cycle|four-]] stroke [[petrol engine]]s.  The [[gasoline|petrol/gasoline]] is highly pressurised, and injected via a [[common rail]] fuel line directly into the [[combustion chamber]] of each [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], as opposed to conventional [[fuel injection#multi-point fuel injection|multi-point fuel injection]] that happens in the [[inlet manifold|intake tract]], or cylinder port.

In some applications, gasoline direct injection enables a stratified fuel charge (ultra [[lean burn]]) combustion for improved [[fuel efficiency]], and reduced emission levels at low load.

==Theory of operation==
The major advantages of a GDI engine are increased [[fuel efficiency]] and high [[power (physics)|power]] output.  In addition, the cooling effect of the injected fuel, and the more evenly dispersed mixtures allow for more aggressive ignition timing curves.  Emissions levels can also be more accurately controlled with the GDI system.  The cited gains are achieved by the precise control over the amount of fuel and injection timings which are varied according to the load conditions.  In addition, there are no throttling losses in some GDI engines, when compared to a conventional [[fuel injection|fuel injected]] or [[carburetor|carbureted]] engine, which greatly improves efficiency, and reduces 'pumping losses' in engines without a throttle plate.  Engine speed is controlled by the [[engine control unit|engine control unit/engine management system]] (EMS), which regulates fuel injection function and ignition timing, instead of having a throttle plate which restricts the incoming air supply.  Adding this function to the EMS requires considerable enhancement of its processing and memory, as direct injection plus the engine speed management must have very precise algorithms for good performance/driveability.

The engine management system continually chooses among three combustion modes: ultra [[lean burn]], [[stoichiometric]], and full power output.  Each mode is characterized by the [[air-fuel ratio]].  The [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] air-fuel ratio for [[petrol]] (gasoline) is 14.7:1 by weight, but ultra lean mode can involve ratios as high as 65:1 (or even higher in some engines, for very limited periods).  These mixtures are much leaner than in a conventional engine and reduce fuel consumption considerably.

* '''Ultra lean burn''' mode is used for light-load running conditions, at constant or reducing road speeds, where no acceleration is required. The fuel is not injected at the [[otto cycle|intake stroke]] but rather at the latter stages of the compression stroke, so that the small amount of air-fuel mixture is optimally placed near the [[spark plug]]. This stratified charge is surrounded mostly by air which keeps the fuel and the flame away from the cylinder walls for lowest emissions and heat losses. The combustion takes place in a [[toroid]]al (donut-shaped) cavity on the [[piston]]'s surface.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} This technique enables the use of ultra-lean mixtures impossible with carburetors or conventional fuel injection.
* '''Stoichiometric''' mode is used for moderate load conditions.  Fuel is injected during the [[otto cycle|intake stroke]], creating a homogenous fuel-air mixture in the cylinder.  From the stoichiometric ratio, an optimum burn results in a clean exhaust emission, further cleaned by the [[catalytic converter]].
* '''Full power''' mode is used for rapid acceleration and heavy loads (as when climbing a hill).  The air-fuel mixture is homogenous and the ratio is slightly richer than stoichiometric, which helps prevent [[engine knocking|knock]] (pinging).  The fuel is injected during the intake stroke.

Direct injection may also be accompanied by other engine technologies such as [[variable valve timing]] (VVT) and tuned/multi path or [[variable length intake manifold]]ing (VLIM, or VIM).  [[Water injection (engines)|Water injection]] or (more commonly) [[exhaust gas recirculation]] (EGR) may help reduce the high [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NOx) emissions which can result from burning [[lean burn|ultra lean]] mixtures.

It is also possible to inject more than once during a single cycle. After the first fuel charge has been ignited, it is possible to add fuel as the piston descends. The benfits are more power and economy, but certain octane fuels have been seen to cause exhaust valve erosion. For this reason, most companies have ceased to use the Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) operation during normal running.

Tuning up an early generation FSI power plant to generate higher power is difficult, since the only time it is possible to inject fuel is during the induction phase. Conventional injection engines can inject throughout the 4 stroke sequence, as the injector squirts onto the back of a closed valve. A direct injection engine, where the injector injects directly into the cylinder is limited to the suction stroke of the piston. As the RPM increases, the time available to inject fuel decreases. Newer FSI systems that have sufficient fuel pressure to inject even late in compression phase do not suffer to the same extent, however they still cannot inject during the exhaust cycle (they could but it would just waste fuel). Hence all other factors being equal a FSI needs higher capacity injectors to achieve the same power as a conventional engine.

==History==
===Early systems===
The first use of direct gasoline injection was on the [[Hesselman engine]] invented by Swedish [[engineer]] [[Jonas Hesselman]] in 1925.<ref>Scania fordonshistoria 1891-1991 av Björn-Eric Lindh, 1992. ISBN 91-7886-074-1</ref><ref>Volvo – Lastbilarna igår och idag av Christer Olsson, 1987. ISBN 91-86442-76-7</ref> Hesselman engines used the ultra lean burn principle and injected the fuel in the  end of the compression stroke and then ignited it with a [[spark plug]], it was often started on gasoline and then switched over to run on diesel or kerosene. The hesselman engine was a low compression design constructed to run on heavy fuel oils.

Direct gasoline injection was used on production aircraft during WWII, with both German ([[Daimler Benz]]) and Soviet ([[KB Khimavtomatika]]) designs. The first automotive direct injection system used to run on gasoline was developed by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], and was introduced by [[Goliath (car)|Goliath]] and [[Gutbrod]] in 1952. The 1955 [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]], the first sports car to use [[fuel injection]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} used direct injection. The Bosch fuel injectors were placed into the bores on the cylinder wall used by the spark plugs in other Mercedes-Benz six-cylinder engines (the spark plugs were relocated to the cylinder head). Later, more mainstream applications of fuel injection favoured less expensive indirect injection methods.

During the late 1970s, the [[Ford Motor Company]] developed a stratified-charge engine they called "ProCo" (programmed combustion),<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947023-4,00.html "Detroit's "Total Revolution""], ''[[TIME magazine]]'', March 19, 1979</ref><ref>[http://www.caranddriver.com/columns/8130/the-steering-column.html "Will gasoline direct injection finally make it?"], [[Csaba Csere]], ''[[Car and Driver]]'', June 2004</ref> utilizing a unique high pressure pump and direct injectors. One hundred [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]] cars were built at Ford's [[Atlanta Assembly]] in [[Hapeville, Georgia]] utilizing a ProCo V8 engine. The project was canceled for several reasons; electronic controls, a key element, were in their infancy; pump and injector costs were extremely high; and lean combustion produced [[nitrogen oxides]] in excess of near future [[United States Environmental Protection Agency‎]] (EPA) limits. Also, the three way [[catalytic converter]] was proven to be a more cost effective solution.

===Later systems===
In '''1996''' gasoline direct injection reappeared in the automotive market.

In '''2010''' Infiniti will produce the M56 which includes DI.

== In two-stroke engines ==

The benefits of [[Two-stroke engine#Direct injection|direct injection]] are even more pronounced in [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] engines, because it eliminates much of the [[Two-stroke engine#Nonpoint source pollution|pollution]] they cause. In conventional two-strokes, the exhaust and intake ports are both open at the same time, at the bottom of the piston stroke. A large portion of the fuel/air mixture entering the cylinder from the crankcase through the intake ports goes directly out, unburned, through the exhaust port. With direct injection, only air comes from the crankcase, and fuel is not injected until the piston rises and all ports are closed.

Two types of GDi are used in two-strokes: low-pressure air-assisted, and high pressure. The former, developed by Orbital Engine Corporation of Australia (now Orbital Corporation) injects a mixture of fuel and compressed air into the combustion chamber. When the air expands it atomizes the fuel into 8-[[micrometre]] droplets, very small relative to the 20 to 30-micrometre fuel droplets in other direct injection systems. The Orbital system is used in [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooters]] manufactured by Aprilia, Piaggio, Peugeot and Kymco, in outboard motors manufactured by Mercury and Tohatsu, and in personal watercraft manufactured by [[Bombardier Recreational Products]] (BRP).

In the early 1990s, Ficht GmbH of [[Kirchseeon]], [[Germany]] developed a high-pressure direct injector for use with [[two stroke]] engines. This injector was unique in that it did not require a high pressure pump but was still capable of generating enough pressure to inject into a closed combustion chamber. [[Outboard Marine Corporation]] (OMC) licensed the technology in 1995 and introduced it on a production outboard engine in 1996.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17331018.html "OMC and Ficht announce strategic alliance"], PR Newswire, July 24, 1995</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18530797.html " OMC Ficht fuel injection engines hit the market"], PR Newswire, July 31, 1996</ref> OMC purchased a controlling interest in Ficht in 1998.<ref>"Marriage Made in Boat Heaven", ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]'', December 26, 1998</ref>
Beset by extensive warranty claims for its Ficht outboards and prior and concurrent management-financial problems,
OMC declared bankruptcy in December 2000 and the engine manufacturing portion and brands ([[Evinrude Outboard Motors]] and [[Johnson Outboards]]), including the Ficht technology, were purchased by BRP in 2001.<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-8397410.html "Canadian, German Companies Buy Assets of Waukegan, Ill., Boating Company"], ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', March 26, 2001</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQK/is_2_6/ai_71766946 OMC Bankruptcy Sets Consumers Adrift | Boat/US Magazine | Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Evinrude introduced the E-Tec system, an improvement to the Ficht fuel injection, in 2003, based on U.S. [[patent]] 6,398,511. In 2004, Evinrude received the EPA Clean Air Excellence Award for their outboards utilizing the E-Tec system.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/air/caaac/2004awar.html "2004 Clean Air Excellence Awards Recipients"], EPA website, 2004</ref> The E-Tec system has recently also been adapted for use in performance two-stroke snowmobiles.

Yamaha also has a high-pressure direct injection (HPDI) system for two-stroke outboards. It differs from the Ficht/E-Tec and Orbital direct injection systems because it uses a separate, belt driven, high pressure, mechanical fuel pump to generate the pressure necessary for injection in a closed chamber. This is similar to most current [[four-stroke cycle|4-stroke]] automotive designs.

[[Envirofit|EnviroFit]], a non-profit corporation sponsored by [[Colorado State University]], has developed direct injection retrofit kits for [[two-stroke]] [[motorcycles]] in a project to reduce [[air pollution]] in [[Southeast Asia]], using technology developed by [[Orbital Corporation Limited|Orbital Corporation]] of [[Australia]].<ref>[http://www.envirofit.org/media/display.php?id=1 Envirofit works to retrofit the Philippines]</ref>
The [[World Health Organization]] says air pollution in Southeast Asia and the Pacific causes 537,000 premature deaths each year. The 100-million two-stroke taxis and motorcycles in that part of the world are a major cause.<ref>[http://www.ernasia.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=313&Itemid=75 Ernasia project - Asian City Air Pollution Data Are Released<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5267 Retrofitting Engines Reduces Pollution, Increases Incomes | Worldwatch Institute<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Twin-fuel engines===
Code named [[Ford EcoBoost engine#EcoBoost V8|Bobcat]] the new twin-fuel engine from [[Ford]]. It is based on a 5.0L V8 engine block, but it uses [[E85]] cylinder injection and gasoline port injection. The engine was co-developed with Ethanol Boosting Systems, LLC of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], which calls its trademarked process DI Octane Boost. The direct injection of ethanol increases the octane of regular gasoline from 88-91 [[Octane rating|octane]] to more than 150 octane. The Bobcat project was unveiled in Department of Energy and Society of Automotive Engineers in April 2009.<ref>[http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2009/06/sneak-peek-ford-bobcat-dual-fuel-engine.html Sneak Peek!
