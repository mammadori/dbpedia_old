===Cayenne (base model)===

[[Image:Cayennehill.png|thumb|right|Electronic Stabilizer decoupling demonstrating extra wheel articulation.]]

The base model is powered by a 3.2-liter [[VR6 engine]] producing {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}}; modifications in the exhaust manifold allow power to peak at 6700 rpm. A Turbo Diesel engine is also available. Acceleration from 0 to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km) is 7.5 seconds with manual transmission and 8.1 seconds with the Tiptronic S. Notably, independent testing has produced a time of 9.2 seconds for the Tiptronic diesel.

===Cayenne S===
The S is powered by an 8-cylinder engine with a dry-sump lubrication system and variable valve timing. The Cayenne S' engine produces {{convert|340|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|369|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. Acceleration from 0-60&nbsp;mph is 6.4 seconds and the top speed is 155 miles per hour.

===Cayenne GTS===
The GTS is powered with a 405&nbsp;hp 4.8 liter V8 and features a sport suspension and {{convert|21|in|mm|sing=on}} wheels. It is lighter than the Cayenne S and has an aerodynamic body kit. The Porsche Cayenne GTS has a 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 5.7 seconds. A six-speed [[manual transmission]] is also offered.<ref>[http://www.automoblog.net/2008/02/15/porsche-cayenne-gts/ Porsche Cayenne GTS at the Chicago Auto Show | Automoblog.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S===
The 1st generation Cayenne Turbo had {{convert|450|hp}}, and accelerated from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 5.3 seconds. A Turbo S version was built in 2006 to compete with the Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG. The Cayenne Turbo S included a low-range case, a locking differential, and the height-adjustable, off-road suspension also standard on the regular Turbo model. It was powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 that produced {{convert|500|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|700|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of torque. Acceleration from 0-60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) was 5.0 seconds and the top speed was 171 miles per hour. It featured a 6-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] Tiptronic transmission.

A new Turbo was revealed at the 2008 Beijing auto show. It received {{convert|50|hp|abbr=on}} more power, and now accelerated from 0-60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) in 4.9 seconds. Also revealed with the new Turbo was a new {{convert|550|hp}} Turbo S. Acceleration from 0-60&nbsp;mph is 4.7 seconds and has optional ceramic composite brakes.

====Hybrid====
At the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#2005|IAA 2005]], Porsche announced it will produce a [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] version of the Cayenne before 2010 (Porsche Cayenne Hybrid). Two years later, at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#2007|IAA 2007]], Porsche presented a functioning Cayenne Hybrid and demonstration model of the drivetrain.

Notable modifications to this car include an electric vacuum pump and hydraulic steering pump, allowing the car to function even when the engine is deactivated. A 288-volt [[nickel metal hydride]] battery is placed under the boot floor, occupying the space normally used for a spare tire. <ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=121999/First Look: Porsche Cayenne Hybrid - Edmunds]</ref>

There will be several versions of the Cayenne Hybrid - Regular, S, and Turbo.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} The regular will have a {{convert|236|hp}} V6 engine, getting the car to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 8.1 seconds.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Cayenne S Hybrid will have a {{convert|328|hp}} V6 engine and will reach {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 6.9 seconds.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Cayenne GTS Hybrid will have a {{convert|383|hp}} V8 engine, accelerating to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 6.0 seconds.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} A Cayenne Turbo Hybrid powering the car to {{Convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 5.3 seconds is rumored but unlikely.

The 2nd-generation Porsche Cayenne is expected to go on sale around April-May 2010 as a 2011 model, with an official debut at the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. In preparation for the upcoming unveiling, the Cayenne production facility in Leipzig, Germany, closed in December 2009 in order to commence the obligatory factory retooling for the new model, a process which is planned to take 2-3 months.

The first spy photos of the car were posted on the internet on the 5th of June 2008.<ref>[http://www.caradvice.com.au/13303/2010-porsche-cayenne-spy-photos/ 2010 Porsche Cayenne spy photos - CarAdvice]</ref>  Further spy photos, taken on June 2, 2009 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/spy-shots-2010-porsche-baby-cayenne.html |title=Spy shots: Porsche's next-gen Cayenne spotted again - &#91;2011 Porsche Cayenne SUV&#93; - MotorAuthority - Car news, reviews, spy shots |publisher=MotorAuthority |date= |accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> and between July 2009 and January 2010 reveal a shorter, smaller Cayenne with more muscular curves, a more slanted rear window and less upright windshield, a more sloping roofline, door-mounted mirrors, smaller windows at the rear of the vehicle, headlights inspired by the [[Porsche Carrera GT|Carrera GT]], taillights that extend onto the car's tailgate, LED [[daytime running lamp|daytime running lights]] and a vastly redesigned interior modeled after the [[Porsche Panamera|Panamera]]. The new Cayenne is expected to be almost 250 kilograms lighter than the current model due to extensive use of aluminum and magnesium, making it more fuel efficient than the current lineup, as well as 5 centimeters shorter than the outgoing model. Due to its lower stance, however, the vehicle's off-road capabilities will be greatly reduced for a more performance-oriented layout and design. Diesel and hybrid variants will also be offered.

The Cayenne will again be the first of the three new SUVs from the VW group; the new [[Volkswagen Touareg]] will be 6–12 months behind, while the next-generation [[Audi Q7]] is due in 2013. Rumored standard features of the 2011 Porsche Cayenne will include air conditioning w/dual-zone climate controls, interior air filter, tilt/telescopic leather-wrapped steering wheel w/radio controls, cruise control, leather upholstery, 12-way power front seats, heated front seats, outside-temperature indicator, universal garage door opener, power liftgate, and power sunroof in the base model. The Cayenne S will add on tri-zone climate controls, heated steering wheel, and a compass. The Cayenne GTS will add on a rearview camera, remote engine start, keyless access and start, and memory system. Finally, the most upscale Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S will add on a navigation system w/voice recognition, premium sound system, 4-zone climate controls, heated rear seats, and 6-disc CD changer.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cayenne S or Turbo? - Page 2 - MBWorld.org Forums says: |url=http://streetcars.co.za/2009/03/2010-porsche-cayenne-suv-spy-shots/ |title=2010 Porsche Cayenne SUV - SPY SHOTS |publisher=StreetCars |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> The new Cayenne models will also offer Porsche's new Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) seven-speed [[dual clutch transmission]] instead of the currently-used six-speed Tiptronic S.

The Cayenne's engines are expected to receive a tuning upgrade, resulting in faster acceleration times with more horsepower and torque, as well as more powerful direct injection technology to improve efficiency. It is expected to source its V8 engines from the Panamera.
