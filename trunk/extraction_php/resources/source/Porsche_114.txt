The '''Porsche 114''' was a proposed design for a [[sports car]] powered by a 1493 cc [[V10 engine|V10]] [[Internal combustion engine|engine]].  

==History==

After designing the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen]] for the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[government|government's]] [[Strength Through Joy|KDF]] program [[Ferdinand Porsche]] considered building a sports car version of the VW.  Internally known as the [[Porsche 64|Porsche Type 64]] this car would feature an [[aluminium]] [[Streamline|streamlined]] body, a 1.5L version of the Volkswagen's original 1.0L engine, and a top speed of at least 160[[Kilometre per hour|km/h]] (90[[Miles per hour|mph]]).  Originally the car was to use a large number of VW parts, but due to the intricacies of then German law it was not legal to sell government made parts to a private company.

==Design==
By 1938 Ferdinand had given up trying to arrange for a supply of VW parts for the Type 64.  Ferdinand and his son [[Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche|Ferry Porsche]] decided to redesign the car from the ground up to be built internally by Porsche.  This would have been the first car actually built by Porsche themselves.  Known as the Type 114, or F-Wagen, a sort of [[portmanteau]] of Ferry and [[Auto Union#The Auto Union racing cars|P-Wagen]], it was a significant departure from the Type 64.  Although it never reached the [[prototype]] stage the design drawings were all but completed and included a novel [[Watercooling|water cooled]] 72Â° V10 engine in a true [[MR layout|mid engine]] layout, as opposed to the VW's [[RR layout|rear engine]] layout.  Suspension was by [[trailing arm]]s in front and [[swing axle]]s in the rear, with [[drum brake]]s at all four corners.  The body was aluminum and resembled a lower, stretched, and streamlined VW.  Porsche had hopes of producing this car, but international tensions and a poor [[recession|economy]] lead to its cancellation.  Porsche did manage to salvage part of its investment by selling the [[transaxle]] design to [[Volkswagen]].    

==Legacy==
The Porsche Type 114 never came to be, but it lived on in a number of Porsche cars.  After [[World War II]] Ferry Porsche began to build sports cars based on the VW, and eventually began production of the [[Porsche 356]] which in concept was identical to the Type 64.  Also [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] research for the 114 led to a series of bodies produced by Porsche for [[Auto racing|racing]] and [[land speed record]] cars, such as the [[Porsche 64|Type 60K10]], a highly modified VW Beetle.  While the type 114 was in the end little more than a design study it had a large impact on the future course of Porsche and the cars that would make the company a dominant force in the automotive world.
