The '''Porsche 996''' is the company's internal name for the version of the [[Porsche 911]] model manufactured and sold between 1998 and 2005. It has since been replaced by the [[Porsche 997|Type 997]]. Both body styles were used in 2005, depending on model. At its debut, it featured the most significant changes to the Carrera model since its 1963 introduction. The most important among these is the fully [[water-cooled]] engine, replacing the previously [[air-cooled]] engines, used exclusively by the Carrera models. More stringent noise regulations and higher customer expectations for both refinement and a higher performance 4 [[valve]] per [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] engine made the switch necessary.  The 996 Carrera (not GT2, GT3 and Turbo models) engine is designed with what Porsche calls "integrated dry sump oiling". This "integrated dry sump" engine does not have an oil scavenge pump in the crankcase to pump the engine oil to a separate holding tank outside the crankcase as a true dry sump design would have. The only scavenge pumps in the 996 engine are in the camshaft boxes and the oil is pumped from there to the bottom of the crankcase as it would be in any "wet sump" engine.  Other changes include a sleeker body with a more steeply raked [[windshield]] and a re-designed interior.

With these differences in mind, many "purists" consider the 996 to be an altogether different car since it is not air-cooled like the 993 and its predecessors all the way to the [[Porsche 356|356]], at least in spirit, than the Carreras that preceded it, as opposed to being a development of the original.

==Design==
The Porsche 996 was an all new design; the first new 911 that didn't carry over a significant component from a previous variant. All new body work, suspension, interior and drive-train including the first water-cooled engine in a 911. The Porsche 996 replaced the [[Porsche 993]].

The first 996s were available as a [[coupe]] or [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] with either rear wheel or four-wheel drive and a 3.4 [[litre]] [[flat-6]] [[normally aspirated engine]] producing 300 [[Horsepower#Brake horsepower (bhp)|bhp]] (224 kW).  These cars had the same front end as the 1996 [[Porsche Boxster]]. Porsche Carrera Owners complained loudly and long about the "lower priced car that looked just like theirs did ", hence the headlight change for the Boxster. The design for the "fried egg" headlamp could be traced all the way back to the [[Porsche Panamericana]] concept car.

In 2000, Porsche debuted the 996 Turbo, equipped with [[four-wheel-drive]] and a 3.6 litre, twin [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] and intercooled flat six producing 415 bhp (309 kW), making the car capable of 3.9 [[second]] 0 to 60 [[Miles per hour|mph]] times.  An "X50" upgrade package was available from the factory in 2002, increasing power to 444 hp (336 kW) through minor revisions to the turbochargers and engine control software.  Porsche produced a Turbo "S" in 2005, featuring the X50 engine upgrades and the formerly optional [[reinforced carbon-carbon#similar products|Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide]] (C/SiC) [[Disc brake#Ceramic composites|composite ceramic brakes]] (PCCB) as standard equipment.

In 2002, the standard models underwent minor re-styling, which included switching to the Turbo-style headlamps and to a new front fascia.  These were sometimes known as the Mk2 generation of the 996.  In addition, engine capacity was also increased to 3.6 litres across the range, yielding gains of 20 horsepower (15 kW) for the non-Turbo models.  2002 also marked the start of the production of the 996 based [[Targa_top|Targa]], featuring a sliding glass "green house" roof system like its [[Porsche 993#Targa|Type 993]] predecessor.  Also in 2002, the Carrera 4S model was first introduced.  The C4S as it is commonly called, shares the widebody look of the Turbo as well as the brakes and suspension.

==GT variants==

The 996 platform was used as the basis for two [[lightweight]] GT variants called [[Porsche 911 GT2|GT2]]<ref>{{cite web|title=First Drive: 2002 Porsche 911 GT2|publisher=''[[Motor Trend]]''|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0106_2002_porsche_911_gt2|accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref> and [[Porsche 911 GT3|GT3]]. The GT3 was based on the standard 996 Carrera, but was stripped of a great deal of equipment for weight savings, featured stiffer, adjustable [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and upgraded brakes, and used the [[bodyshell]] of the four-wheel-drive version, which incorporated additional front-end stiffening. It was produced in two versions. The first, commonly referred to as the Mk.I GT3, was released in 1999 in all markets, save North America. It featured a naturally aspirated version 3.6L flat six making {{convert|360|bhp|abbr=on}}. This engine was shared with the 996 Turbo and was a derivative of the [[Le Mans]] winning engine developed for the [[Porsche 911 GT1|911 GT1]]. The Mk.II GT3 variant was based on the second generation of the 996, and featured updated aerodynamics, and a more powerful version of the 3.6L engine from the MK.I, now producing {{convert|380|bhp|abbr=on}}. The Mk.II was the first GT3 marketed in the North America. In a 2004 testing of the Mk.II GT3, the car accelerated 0-60&nbsp;mph in 4.0 seconds, and produced 1.03&nbsp;g on the skidpad, the second highest number ever recorded by a street legal automobile.

Also its counterpart, the GT2, was [[Rear-wheel drive|RWD]] mainly to save weight.<ref name=March>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car_news/porsche_911_gt2_car_news|title=Porsche 911 GT2 - Car News |date=March 2001|work=[[Car and Driver]]|accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> It received an added group of aerodynamic body parts, and a re-tuned version of the 996 Turbo's 3.6 litre, twin turbocharged engine featuring larger turbochargers and intercoolers, revised intake and [[exhaust system]]s, and re-programmed engine control software. The result was {{convert|477|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|472|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] ({{convert|462|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|620|Nm|lbÂ·ft|abbr=on}} respectively for the pre-2003 "Mk.I" cars), enough to launch the car from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 3.6 seconds and to a top speed of {{convert|198|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Bigger wheels and tires along with lightweight [[Disc brake#Ceramic composites|ceramic brakes]] were standard.<ref name=March/> The GT2's fixed rear wing (made of [[CFRP]] for the post-2003 cars) appears to be a concession to racing rules that usually outlaw moving aerodynamic devices.<ref name=March/> It had no rear seat and no air conditioning.<ref name=March/> Both cars were available only with six-speed manual [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]]. 

The Turbo, GT2 and GT3 models use the Aluminum crankcase of the air-cooled 911 with its true dry sump oiling system. The six separate individual Nikasil lined cylinders in this engine are covered with two separately installed water jackets each covering a bank of 3 cylinders on each side of the engine, thus adding water cooling to a crankcase originally designed for air-cooled cylinders (the normal 996 Carrera engine has the cylinders and water jackets cast together with the crankcase). This engine is very similar to that of the Le Mans winning Dauer Porsche 962 and Porsche GT1 racing car's engines.

==Evolution==
The 99/00/01 cars are all basically the same. 2002 brought a stiffer body which improved safety and handling. They also added [[Seat belt#Pretensioners_and_webclamps|seat belt pretensioners]]. The [[Tiptronic]] in 2000 was modified to allow it to enter [[manual transmission|manual]] mode by clicking the [[steering wheel]] mounted buttons. The Tiptronic would go back to [[automatic transmission|auto]] mode after 8 seconds. The 2002 cars received the 996 turbo Tiptronic box which is stronger, shifts faster and had 250 shift modes. 2002 cars also received a 3.6L engine which provided an extra {{convert|20|bhp|abbr=on}}. It also had some improved parts helping with some reliability issues on the 3.4L engines. The X74 suspension which lowers and stiffens the car was also available as a 2002+ factory modification. Meanwhile, [[VarioCam|Variocam Plus]] had become standard for every 996 till production ended.

==Special Editions==
Porsche offered a special edition of the 996 for the year 2000. The company introduced the car as "The 911 for the Millennium" and based it on the {{dn|Porsche Carrera|Carrera 4}} [[coupe]]. Only 911 were made.

This special edition was finished in Violet Chromaflair paint with natural [[leather]] interior and dark burr maple [[trim package|trim]]. Available with a [[Tiptronic]] or six-speed [[manual gearbox]], the car was well-equipped. A number plate on the center console and a unique "911" badge on the engine lid and lettering on the door sills make this special edition easy to identify.

Porsche celebrated the 911's 40-year history in 2003, using the slogan, "40 Jahre 911/40 Fast Years". The company also introduced the 996 "40th Anniversary Edition" for model year 2004. This model has the 996 Turbo's front-end, and was available only in Carrera GT Silver exterior paint. Other unique features included: X51 power kit, turbo radiators, limited slip differential, sport [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], polished 5-spoke alloys (unique to this model), GT3 side skirts, natural gray leather interior (with luggage set to match), sports seats (there was a power comfort seat option), polished exhaust tips, heated seats, litronic [[Headlamp#HID (xenon) light sources|bi-xenon]] headlights, special dynamic sealed panels, and a special "40 Jahre 911" logo on the back. The power was increased from 325 to {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}}.  Only 1,963 units were made, to commemorate 1963--the year the 911 was introduced.
