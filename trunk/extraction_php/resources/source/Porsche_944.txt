The Porsche 944 is a [[sports car]] built by [[Porsche]] between 1982 to 1991. It was built on the same platform as the [[Porsche 924|924]], although 924 production continued through 1988. The 944 was intended to last into the 1990s, but major revisions planned for a 944 S3 model were eventually rolled into the [[Porsche 968|968]] instead, which replaced the 944. The 944 was a successful model and was available as both a coupe and cabriolet in naturally aspirated and [[turbocharged]] forms.
==History and model overview==
[[Image:Porsche 944 Frontansicht.jpg|thumb|left|1985-1991 Porsche 944]]
The [[Porsche 924]] had originally been a project of VW-Porsche a joint Porsche/[[Volkswagen]] company created to develop and produce the [[Porsche 914|914]] which was sold in Europe as both a Porsche and a Volkswagen.  In 1972 a replacement for the Volkswagen version of the 914, code named EA-425 began development.  The model was to be sold as an [[Audi]] as part of the VW-Audi-Porsche marketing arrangement.  Although testing had begun in the Spring of 1974 Volkswagen decided to cancel the program due to the expense of production as well as the feeling that the recently released [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] would fill the sports coupe sufficiently.  At the time Porsche was considering introducing their own water cooled front engine 2+2 coupe to replace the [[Porsche 912|912E]] and their model of [[Porsche 914|914]] and Volkswagen's cancellation provided an opportunity.  Porsche purchased the design and finished developmental. The vehicle drove and handled exceptionally well and received positive reviews, but was criticized for the Audi-sourced 2 litre engine; Porsche introduced a Turbocharged 924 to increase performance, but the price was considered too high for the time, which hampered sales. Rather than scrap the design , Porsche decided to develop the 924, as they had with generations of the [[Porsche 911|911]]; although model numbers would change, the 924 would provide the basis for its replacement.

Porsche re-worked the platform and abandoned the Audi engine, installing in its place a new all-alloy 2.5 litre [[straight-4]] engine that was, in essence, half of the [[Porsche 928|928's]] 5.0 litre [[V8]], although very few parts were actually interchangeable. Not a natural choice for a luxury sports car, a four cylinder engine was chosen for fuel efficiency and size, because it had to be fitted from below on the Neckarsulm production line. To overcome the unbalanced secondary forces that make other four cylinder engines feel harsh, Porsche included two counter rotating  [[balance shaft]]s running at twice engine speed. Invented in 1904 by British engineer [[Frederick Lanchester]], and further developed and patented in 1975 by [[Mitsubishi Motors]], balance shafts carry eccentric weights which produce inertial forces that balance out the unbalanced secondary forces, making a [[Straight-4|four cylinder]] engine feel as smooth as a [[Straight-6|six cylinder]]. The engine was factory-rated at {{convert|150|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in its U.S. configuration. Revised [[bodywork]] with wider wheel arches, similar to that of the [[Porsche 924 Carrera GT|924 Carrera GT]], a fresh interior and upgrades to the [[brake|braking]] and [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] systems rounded out the major changes. Porsche introduced the 944 for [[model year|MY]] 1982 to great anticipation. In addition to being slightly faster (despite having a poorer drag co-efficient than the 924), the 944 was better equipped and more refined than the 924, it had better handling and stopping power and was more comfortable to drive. The factory-claimed 0-60&nbsp;mph time of over 9 seconds (8.3 seconds according to "Porsche the Ultimate Guide" By Scott Faragher) was actually rather modest. The factory-claimed top speed of {{convert|130|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} was also pessimistic, Autocar having verified a top speed of {{convert|137|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}{{Verify source|date=September 2009}}. The car had nearly even front to rear weight distribution (50.7%front/49.3%rear) thanks to the rear transaxle balancing out the engine in the front.<ref>Car and Driver, Dec. 1985 issue, http://www.europeancarweb.com/projectcars/0310ec_1986_porsche_944_turbo_specifcations/index.html</ref> This gave it very balanced, predictable handling at the limits of adhesion.

In mid-1985 the 944 underwent its first significant changes. These included :- a new [[dash]] and door panels, embedded radio antenna, upgraded alternator (from 90 amp to 115 amp), increased oil sump capacity, new front and rear cast [[alloy]] control arms and semi-trailing arms, larger fuel tank, optional heated and powered seats, Porsche HiFi sound system, and revisions in the mounting of the [[transaxle]] to reduce noise and vibration. The "cookie cutter" style wheels used in the early 944s were upgraded to new "phone dial" style wheels.  1985 model year cars incorporating these changes are sometimes referred to as "1985B" or "1985 1/2" cars.

In early 1989 before the release of the 944S2, Porsche upgraded the 944 from the 2.5 liter engine to a 2.7 liter engine with slightly more horsepower but a significant increase in torque. In addition to more displacement the new motor also had larger valves.
===944 Turbo (951)===
In 1985 Porsche introduced the 944 Turbo, a higher-performance variant, known internally as the 951 (952 for right-hand drive models). This had a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] and [[intercooler|intercooled]] version of the standard car's engine that produced 220&nbsp;hp (217 in the US) at 6000 rpm. The turbo was the world's first car using a ceramic portliner to retain exhaust gas temperature. The Turbo also featured several other revisions, such as improved [[aerodynamics]], strengthened [[gearbox]], standard [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] oil cooler, wider wheels, and upgraded suspension. Major engine component revisions, more than thirty in all, were made to the 951 to compensate for increased internal loads and heat.

[[Image:1987 Porsche 944 Turbo.JPG|thumb|right|1987 Porsche 944 Turbo (US Model)]]

In 1988, Porsche introduced the 944 Turbo S. The 944 Turbo S had a more powerful engine (designation number M44/52) with 247&nbsp;hp (compared to the standard 944 Turbo's 217&nbsp;hp) and 350 Nm torque (or 258&nbsp;ft·lbf, versus 243&nbsp;ft·lbf). This higher output was achieved by using a larger turbo housing on the exhaust side, and a remapped engine computer. In June 1988, Car and Driver tested the 944 Turbo S and achieved a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 5.5 seconds and a quarter mile time of 13.9 seconds at {{convert|101|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The intake manifold features an additional vacuum port for two total vacuum ports, but intake manifolds can be swapped between S and non-S cars.

The 944 Turbo S's suspension was the then state-of-the-art "M030" option consisting of upgraded Koni adjustable shocks front and rear, ride height adjusting threaded collars on the front struts, progressive springs, larger rear torsion bars, harder bushings throughout, larger {{convert|26.8|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} anti-roll bars at the front, and chassis stiffening brackets in the front frame rails.  The air conditioning dryer lines are routed differently to clear the front frame brace on the drivers side.  The 944 Turbo S wheels, known as the Club Sport design, were 16" forged and flat-dished, similar to the contemporary 928. Wheel widths were {{convert|7.5|in|mm|0}} in the front, and {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} in the rear; sizes of the Z-rated tires were 225/50 in the front and 245/45 in the rear.  The front and rear wing edges were rolled to accommodate the larger wheels. The [[manual transmission]] (case code designation: AOR) of the 944 Turbo S had toughened first and second gears including synchros, standard external cooler (available on earlier turbos as an option, except 1985-1986 models, where it was also standard), and a standard limited slip differential with a 40% lockup setting. The Turbo S front brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 928 S4, with larger 4 piston fixed calipers and discs; ABS was also standard.

The 944 Turbo S interior featured full power seats for both driver and passenger, where the majority of the factory-built Turbo S models sported a "Burgundy plaid" (Silver Rose edition) but other interior/exterior colors were available. A 10 speaker sound system and equalizer + amp was a common upgrade.

In 1989 the 'S' designation was dropped from the 944 Turbo S, and all 944 Turbos featured the 'S' package as standard. The regular 944's displacement was increased to 2.7 L.

===944 S===
In 1987, the [[naturally-aspirated]] 944 S ("Super") variant was introduced. The 944S had a more powerful {{convert|190|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} version of the 2.5 litre engine with twin overhead camshafts and 16 valve heads. This marked the first use of four [[valve]] per cylinder [[cylinder head|head]]s in the 944 series. Performance was quoted as 0 - 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) in 7.8 seconds and {{convert|230|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} top speed.

Also in 1987, dual air-bags and ABS were introduced as options on the base model.  Wheel offset was increased from {{convert|23|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|52|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} to provide clearance for the optional ABS brakes.

===944 S2===
In 1989 944S2 was introduced, and powered by a {{Convert|211|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 3.0 L engine.  The 944S2 had the same rounded nose and a rear valance found on the Turbo model. The S2 was also available as a [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]], a first for the 944 line.  Performance was quoted as 0-60&nbsp;mph in 6.2 seconds (0-100&nbsp;km/h 6.4 s), with a top speed of {{convert|240|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} (manual transmission).

===944 Turbo Cabriolet===
In February 1991 Porsche released the 944 Turbo Cabriolet, which combined the Turbo S's {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine with the [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] body.  Porsche initially announced that 500 would be made; ultimately 625 were built, 100 of which were right-hand drive for the United Kingdom, Japanese, Australian and South African market.  None were imported to the US.

===End of the line===
In early 1990, Porsche engineers began working on what they had intended to be the third evolution of the 944, the S3. As they progressed with the development process, they realized that so many parts were being changed that they had produced an almost entirely new vehicle. Porsche consequently shifted development from the 944 S3 to the car that would replace the 944 entirely, the [[Porsche 968|968]]. The 944's final year of production was 1991; in 1992 the 968 debuted.  The 968 was sold alongside the [[Porsche 928|928]] through 1995, when both models were discontinued.

Although the Porsche 944 has become a rare sight on the street, it has proven to be successful and increasingly popular in amateur road course racing. The [http://www.944-Spec.org 944-Spec class] caters to the 1983 to 1988 8-valve 944, and the [http://www.44cup.com 944 Cup]series has classes for all 924/944/968 and 944 Turbo models.  Both enjoy strong competition in racing events held by the [[National Auto Sport Association]] and other organizations, as well as compatible rules that allow the same cars to race with the [[Sports Car Club of America]], [[Porsche Club of America]], and Porsche Owner's Club.

==Awards==
The 944 was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'s'' [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] from 1983 through 1985, and the ''Turbo'' made the list for 1986.

In 1984, [[Car and Driver]] named the 944 the "Best Handling Production Car in America."

==Production==
In total 163,192 944s were produced between 1982 and 1991.
===944===
A total of 113,070 944s were made between 1982 and 1989, with 56,921 being exported to the United States.
