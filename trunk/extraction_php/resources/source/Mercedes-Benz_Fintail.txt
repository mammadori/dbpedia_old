'''Mercedes Benz Fintail''' ({{lang-de|'''Heckflosse'''}}) is a nickname given to certain Mercedes Benz vehicles which show American influences in design including the presence of tailfins. Though never officially designated as such (they were designated Peilstege, marking the end of the car in rear view mirror). The Fintail series replaced the Ponton series.
