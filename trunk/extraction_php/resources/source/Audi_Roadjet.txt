The '''Audi Roadjet''' is a [[concept car]] developed by the [[Germany|German]] manufacturer [[Audi]], and was officially unveiled at the 2006 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]].  It is a study of a sporty and luxurious mid-size [[hatchback]].

The concept vehicle is particularly notable because it is the first model to feature a newly developed 3.2-liter [[VR6 engine|VR6]] [[Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) [[petrol engine]] with direct fuel injection.  The engine develops a maximum output of {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000 rpm and 363 [[newton metre|Nm]] (244 [[ftÂ·lbf]]) of torque at 4,500 rpm, which is reached through the fixed [[intake manifold]] and the innovative [[valve]] control system called Audi Valvelift System.  The Roadjet, also notable to be the first model equipped with the 7-speed [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]], should be able to accelerate from 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h (60 mph) in 6.4 seconds, while its top speed is electronically limited at 250&nbsp;km/h (155 mph).  The vehicle also features Audi's trademark [[four-wheel drive]] system - [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]].

According to Audi, this study is a technology demonstrator of innovative electronic systems that will be built into the production models in the next few years.
