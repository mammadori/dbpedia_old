The '''Opel Corsa''' is a [[supermini]] that has been produced by [[General Motors]]' European [[subsidiary]] [[Opel]] since 1982 and has also been sold under a variety of other brands (most notably [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]], [[Chevrolet]], and [[Holden]]), and also spawned various derivatives in different markets, all of which are listed in appropriate sections below. The names '''Vauxhall Nova''', '''Holden Barina''' and '''Chevrolet Chevy''' have been used for the Corsa in certain markets.

Despite its global presence, it has never been sold in the [[United States]] or [[Canada]].

The Corsa is built at [[Figueruelas]] in [[Spain]], and in other countries such as [[Germany]] ([[Eisenach]]), [[Argentina]] ([[Rosario]]), [[Brazil]] ([[São Caetano do Sul]] and [[São José dos Campos]]), [[Colombia]] ([[Bogotá]]), [[Mexico]] ([[Ramos Arizpe]]), [[South Africa]] ([[Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape|Port Elizabeth]]), [[India]] ([[Halol]]), and [[China]] ([[Shanghai]]).

The [[front-wheel drive]] Corsa was first launched in April 1983 to replace the Opel Kadett C City. Built in Zaragoza, Spain, the first Corsas were three-door [[hatchback]] and two-door [[saloon (car)|saloon]] models, with four-door and five-door versions arriving in 1984. The basic model was called just the Corsa, which was followed by the Corsa Luxus, Corsa Berlina and the sporty Corsa SR. Six years later, the Corsa received a facelift, which included a new front fascia and some other minor changes. The models were called LS, GL, GLS and GT. The Corsa was known in the UK market as the Vauxhall Nova.

[[File:Vauxhallnova.jpg|thumb|left|A Vauxhall Nova for the British market]]
Power first came from 1.0&nbsp;L 45&nbsp;hp, 1.2&nbsp;L 55&nbsp;hp, 1.3&nbsp;L 70&nbsp;hp and 1.4&nbsp;L 75&nbsp;hp petroleum engines. (the first engines were all equiped with carburators, fuel injection came later, only on the 1.2 and 1.4 engines). The engines were based on well proven [[GM Family II engine|GM Family II]] design, except for 1.0&nbsp;L engine which was based on the [[Opel OHV engine|OHV]] unit from the Kadett C.  There was also a 1.5&nbsp;L diesel engine available, which was also used in the [[Isuzu Gemini]] at around the same time. The engines and most of the mechanical components were derived from those used in the [[Opel Kadett|Astra/Kadett]].

A rare "Sport" model was produced from 1983 in order to homologate for the sub 1300&nbsp;cc class of [[Group A]] for the [[British Rally Championship]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. These sport models had SR suspension, SR engine with twin Weber 40 DCOE carburettors, a bespoke camshaft, close ratio GTE gearbox, and few luxuries. This gave 93&nbsp;hp and a top speed of 112&nbsp;mph (180&nbsp;km/h) with a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 8.9 seconds. These are by far the rarest models (500 produced) and thus acquire a high market price if one does become available. 

A 1.6&nbsp;L multi-point [[fuel injected]] engine with {{convert|100|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and capable of {{convert|186|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} was later added to the Corsa/Nova, giving decent performance and being badged as a GSi (GTE in pre-facelift models in the UK, later models were all called GSi). A model with an {{convert|82|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.4&nbsp;L multi-point fuel injected engine also became available as the SRi, which was otherwise mechanically identical to the GSi.

The design was freshened in 1990 with new bumpers, headlights, grille and interior, but the car was showing its age against strong competition such as the [[Renault Clio]] and [[Peugeot 106]].

===Vauxhall Nova===
The Vauxhall Nova (name for the Opel Corsa in UK) was produced by [[General Motors]] between 1983 and 1993, primarily for the [[United Kingdom|British]] market. It replaced the [[Vauxhall Chevette]] and [[Opel Kadett|Opel Kadett City]]. All Nova and Vauxhall Corsa models were made in Spain, with the first British customers taking delivery of their cars in April 1983. It gave Vauxhall a much-needed modern competitor in the UK supermini market, as the Chevette was older than the majority of its competitors, chiefly the [[Ford Fiesta]] and [[Austin Metro]].

Sales in the UK were strong right up to the end, but by the time the last Nova was made in early 1993, it was looking very dated in comparison to more modern rivals like the [[Peugeot 106]] and [[Renault Clio]]. Its successor was the Corsa (B); the first Vauxhall to adopt the same model name as the Opel version.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} By 1996, all models of the Vauxhall and Opel ranges were identically named.

In 1993 the Corsa B was unveiled, and in the UK, Vauxhall dropped the '''Nova''' name, with the car now being known as the Corsa. The following year, it was launched by [[Holden]] in [[Australia]], as the '''Barina''', replacing a version of the [[Suzuki Swift]] sold under that name. This proved a success, and was the first Spanish-built car to be sold in significant volumes in the Australian market.

[[Straight-4|Four-cylinder]] power came from 1.2&nbsp;L [[GM Family 0 engine|Family 0]], 1.4&nbsp;L and 1.6&nbsp;L [[GM Family 1 engine|Family 1]] petrol engines, as well as an economical 1.5&nbsp;L [[turbodiesel]] engine. Unlike the previous model, there was no saloon version, but one was designed in Brazil for the Latin American market, as saloons were much preferred to hatchbacks. This was also introduced in South Africa and India. A station wagon, panel van and pick-up truck were also introduced. The wagon version was sold in some European markets (including [[Italy]]), badged as an Opel. The Corsa also spawned a small coupé called [[Opel Tigra]]. A 1.0&nbsp;L [[straight-3|3-cylinder]] [[GM Family 0 engine|Family 0]] economy version was launched in 1996, and a [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]-tuned suspension was added as well as an exterior refresh. Strong competition came from new models like the [[Peugeot 206]], [[Fiat Punto]] and [[Škoda Fabia]].

[[File:1997-2000 Holden SB Barina Cabrio 01.jpg|thumb|left|1997–2000 [[w:en:Holden Barina|Holden SB Barina]] Cabrio (Australia).]]

The sedan model is still built and sold in Latin America as '''Chevrolet Corsa Classic'''. A budget version introduced for the Brazilian market, the '''[[Chevrolet Celta]]''', has bodywork resembling the late 1990s [[Opel Vectra|Vectra]] and [[Opel Astra|Astra]]. The Celta is sold in Argentina as the Suzuki Fun.

The saloon and wagon versions were produced in China by [[Shanghai GM]] as '''Buick Sail''' and '''Buick Sail S-RV''', respectively, until 2005. That year they became known as the Chevrolet Sail and SRV. In September 2006, Chile became the first country outside [[China]] to receive the Chinese-assembled Sail; it is called the '''Chevrolet Corsa Plus''', available as a four-door sedan with a 1.6&nbsp;L {{convert|92|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine. The Corsa Plus includes dual front airbags, anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, electric windows and central locking as standard equipment.

In India, the hatchback, saloon and wagon versions were sold as the '''Corsa Sail''', '''Corsa''' (or '''Corsa Joy''') and '''Corsa Swing''' respectively until the end of 2005. The hatchback model was still being produced, and extensively marketed in South Africa as the '''Corsa Lite''' under the Opel branding until 2009 at which point the '''Corsa Lite''' was discontinued.

===Mexico===
{{Main|Cars in Mexico}}
In 1994, '''General Motors de México''' first marketed the Corsa B as the '''Chevy''', which would quickly replace [[Volkswagen]]'s [[Volkswagen Beetle|Sedán]] as the people's favorite. For 2004 (after the Corsa C was introduced), a Mexican designed and produced version of the hatchback and sedan, known as the Chevy C2, was released, which is also sold in Colombia. All Mexican previous versions were known as the '''Chevy''', with the names '''Monza''' used on the sedan, and '''Swing''' (5-door) and '''Joy''' (3-door) for the hatchbacks. The latter 2004 and 2008 redesigns were simply named '''Chevy''' and '''Chevy Sedán'''. The Chevy remains a favorite among taxicab drivers and one of the best selling cars in the country{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.

The Corsa C was revealed in 1999 and introduced to the European market in 2000. [[General Motors]] dubbed the new chassis [[GM Gamma platform|Gamma]] and intended to use it in a number of other models.

[[File:GM chevrolet corsa sedan 2008.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Chevrolet Corsa C ''"Premium Version"'' (Brazil)]]

A [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] version is also offered in Latin America, South Africa and the Middle East. The Brazilian version of the Corsa sold in those countries featured a more conservative front end than its European counterpart. Brazil also offers a pickup truck version of the Corsa named the '''[[Chevrolet Montana]]''' (sold in some markets as the '''Tornado'''), which, as well as the sedan, is exported in [[complete knock down|completely knocked down]] form to South Africa for local assembly. [[Delta Motor Corporation|GM South Africa]] markets the hatchback simply as '''The New Corsa''', and the pickup version as the '''Utility'''. Since 2007, the Corsa C saloon has been discontinued in South Africa.

===Mexico===
[[File:'03-'05 Chevrolet Corsa Comfort.jpg|thumb|left|2003-05 Chevrolet Corsa Comfort sedan (Mexico)]]
The Corsa C arrived in the 2002 [[model year]] as a five-[[car door|door]] hatchback, and was imported from Europe; but for the 2003 model year, the Corsa sold in [[Mexico]] began coming from Brazil and a sedan version was added.  In 2005, the sedan version introduced a [[semi-automatic transmission]] called [[easytronic]] because it was only offered in a five-speed [[manual transmission]], however, the easytronic transmission was rapidly discontinued after the 2007 model year because of poor sales and technical flaws.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  For 2008, the Corsa was tweaked with a freshened grille, lights and a gold colored Chevrolet logo.  The Chevrolet Corsa C was discontinued from the Mexican market in June 2008 leaving only the older and freshened Chevy (Corsa B); and was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Aveo]].

In 2002, the Corsa chassis spawned a [[mini MPV]] called the '''[[Opel Meriva]]''', development of which began under Opel in [[Rüsselsheim]] (but finished by Chevrolet in Brazil).

The Corsa C is still manufactured and sold in South America.  The production plant that produces this car model is located in [[São Caetano do Sul]], Brazil.

Since 2007, the Latin American Corsa C features the Opel-inspired Chevrolet logo with a golden bowtie instead of a chromed one - the new logo was first introduced in the South American market with the new Chevrolet Vectra.

In Australia, the car was launched to much fanfare from many motor journalists, and went on the win the [[Wheels magazine|Wheels]] 2001 "Car Of The Year" ([[COTY]]).  Holden also imported the SRi version with the 1.8L Astra motor and uprated sports suspension including traction control, ABS brakes, a better tyre/wheel combination and Irmscher body kit to produce a "baby hot hatch" Barina.  The face lifted 2004 model was also imported, however, in December 2005, the Corsa C was dropped from the Australian and [[New Zealand]] Holden ranges as a cost-cutting measure by GM, to be replaced by the [[Daewoo Kalos]], which is now badged as a Holden Barina.  Motoring journalists have been scathing in their criticism of the new model, particularly the bland handling, lackluster engine and below-par safety features.

===United Kingdom===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
[[File:Corsa.jpg|thumb|right|A Vauxhall Corsa]]
This Corsa was a huge success for [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] in Britain, being the most popular supermini and second most popular car overall in 2002, 2003 and 2004. It was also Britain's best selling supermini in 2005, achieving third place overall, but in 2006 (the final year of production) it lost top place in the supermini sector after five years, and was overtaken by the [[Ford Fiesta]]. Overall, it was Britain's fourth most popular car in 2006.

=== Engine specifications ===
The Corsa C was introduced with a 1.7&nbsp;L ''[[Fuel injection#Direct injection|DTI]] Ecotec'' turbodiesel engine supplied by Isuzu ([[Circle L engine|Circle L]]) with 75&nbsp;hp (55&nbsp;kW). This was later joined by the 1.7&nbsp;L ''[[Fuel injection#Direct injection|DI]] Ecotec'' turbodiesel engine also supplied by Isuzu. The 1.7&nbsp;L ''DI Ecotec'' did not include an intercooler and this reduced power to {{convert|65|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/news/pr_old/pressrelease_56.htm|title=2001 Opel Corsa press release}}</ref> From 2003 a new 1.3&nbsp;L ''[[Common rail|CDTI]] Ecotec'' turbodiesel engine was supplied by Fiat ([[JTD engine|MultiJet]]) which produced {{convert|70|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 1.7&nbsp;L ''[[Common rail|CDTI]] Ecotec'' turbodiesel was supplied by Isuzu which produced {{convert|100|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This new 1.7 L ''CDTI Ecotec'' featured a [[variable geometry turbocharger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/news/pr_old/pressrelease_1587.htm|title=2003 Opel Corsa press release}}</ref>

The 1.0&nbsp;L and 1.2&nbsp;L ''Ecotec'' [[GM Family 0 engine|Family 0]] engines are carry-overs from the Corsa B; but the 1.4&nbsp;L [[GM Family 1 engine|Family 1]] engine was replaced with a new Family 0 model of the same displacement. The 1.8&nbsp;L Family 1 engine is an upgrade for the previous 1.6&nbsp;L 16-valve engine and produces {{convert|125|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|165|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The edition with the 1.8&nbsp;L engine was named Corsa GSi and was the predecessor of the new Corsa OPC. In 2003, Opel introduced updated versions of these engines with [[TwinPort]] technology, and the 1.2&nbsp;L engine gained another {{convert|5|PS|abbr=on}}, giving it {{convert|80|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} .

The Corsa D was created using a new version of the [[GM Gamma platform|Gamma platform]], which was co-developed by Fiat and [[Opel]], and is also employed by the 2006 [[Fiat Grande Punto]]. The first official pictures of the Corsa D were released by Opel in May 2006.

The new Corsa is available in both three and five-door versions, and once again marketed as a Vauxhall in the UK. The same engines sizes from the Corsa C were available at launch, although the 1.3&nbsp;L CDTI and 1.7&nbsp;L CDTI engines were upgraded, with power ranging from {{convert|75|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|125|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|192|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} OPC/VXR version went on sale in early 2007, with a 1.6&nbsp;L [[turbocharged]] petrol engine powering the front wheels. The {{convert|75|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.3 CDTI engine was updated in mid-2007 to bring CO<sub>2</sub> levels to just 119 g/km, meaning that 12 months' road tax in the UK costs £35 and is eligible for the Plan 2000E (a rebate of €2000 in the purchase of a new car) in Spain.<ref>http://www.planrenovopel.es/pdf/queesplan2000E.pdf</ref>
