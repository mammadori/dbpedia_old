The '''Mercedes-Benz E-Class''' is a range of [[executive car|executive-size]] cars manufactured by [[Mercedes-Benz]] in various engine and body configurations. The E initially stood for ''Einspritzmotor'', (German for fuel injection); a new feature in volume production vehicles at the time that the E-Class first appeared, with the E as a suffix to the engine nomenclature (e.g. 230E) in the 1950s. It was not until the launch of the facelifted [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] that the E was used as a prefix (i.e. E220) and the model referred to officially as the E-Class (or ''E-Klasse''). At this time all Mercedes cars used fuel injection and the company felt it was not necessary to add this as a distinguishing feature. Due to the E-Class' size and durability, the cars also frequently serve as taxis in European countries. Older models like the W123 and W124 are used in Malaysia as inter-state taxis, and the most current model is used in Singapore as a taxi., and Mercedes-Benz offers a taxi specification as well as other special-purpose vehicles (e.g. police or ambulance modifications) from the factory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mercedes-benz.de/content/germany/mpc/mpc_germany_website/de/home_mpc/sonderfahrzeuge0/home/products/branch-solutions/taxi0/e-klasse.html |title=Mercedes-Benz Deutschland - Sonderfahrzeuge - Taxi - E-Klasse |accessdate=2008-08-05 |publisher= [[Daimler AG]] |language=German }}</ref>

== History ==
===W120 'Ponton'===
{{main|Mercedes-Benz W120}}

The first modern mid size Mercedes was the [[Mercedes-Benz W120|W120 'Ponton' 180]] of 1953.  Sharing its engineering with the [[Mercedes-Benz R121|R121]] 190 SL of 1955, the Ponton was a stylish sedan with [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] power. A larger-engined [[Mercedes-Benz W121|W121 190]] appeared in 1958.

===W110 'Fintail'===
{{main|Mercedes-Benz W110}}

Mercedes added tailfins to both the big [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]] and the new [[Mercedes-Benz W110|W110 'Fintail' 190]] of 1962. [[Straight-6]] power appeared for the first time in the 1965 230 model, and the fours grew in displacement that year as well.

===W114/W115 'Stroke-8'===
{{main|Mercedes-Benz W114}}

The mid size Mercedes was redesigned in 1968 as the [[Mercedes-Benz W114|W114/W115 'Stroke-8']]. This time, the 6-cylinder models (The W114s) were most prevalent, with the W115 line making up the bottom of the company's offerings with four - and [[Straight-5|five-cylinder]] power. [[Diesel engine|Diesel]] engines joined the line-up, as did a [[coupé]] body.

===W123===
{{main|Mercedes-Benz W123}}

The popular [[Mercedes-Benz W123|W123]] quickly became a best-seller on its launch in 1977.  Especially in [[Diesel engine|Diesel]] [[Mercedes-Benz 240D|240D]] (and later [[Mercedes-Benz 300D|300D]]) guises, the cars enhanced the company's reputation for product quality. Over 2.3 million were produced until the end of production in 1985.

Saloon/Sedan, Coupé and Estate body configurations were offered.

The 'E-Class' name first appeared in the USA with the face-lifted [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] in 1994 (the w124 was introduced in the US in 1986 but continued with the older models naming convention until 1994, when all Mercedes Benz models switched to a new system i.e. E320 instead of 300E). The [[Mercedes-Benz 300D|300D]] continued to be the fuel economy option over the 4 and 6 cylinder gasoline engines, and the gasoline [[V8 engine]]s (available after 1992) increased gasoline power outputs further. The V8 powered sedans/saloons were named 400E/500E from 1992-1993, and E420/E500 after 1993. Likewise, the 3-liter cars (e.g., 'E300') where also re-badged to 'E320' with the new 3.2 [[litre]] [[internal combustion engine|engines]] and naming rationalization of 1994. 

Saloon/Sedan, Coupé, Convertible and Estate body configurations were offered.

From 1992 to 1994  Mercedes offered a limited production sport version of the W124 sedan, created and assembled with help from [[Porsche]]. This was called the [[Mercedes-Benz 500E|500E]] (E500 for 1994).

The [[Mercedes-Benz W210|W210]] E-Class, launched in 1996, brought the mid-size Mercedes firmly into the upper end of the luxury market. Though six-cylinder models were still offered for a time, the four-light front end and high prices moved the car upmarket. In September 1999 the W210 E-class was facelifted. This included visual, mechanical and quality improvements over the earlier versions. The Coupe/Cabriolet versions were called W208. <ref>[http://www.exoticspotted.com/2009/mercedes-benz-e-class-histor/]</ref>

Launched in 2002, the [[Mercedes-Benz W211|W211]] E-Class was another evolution of the previous model and was considered by the motoring media as an even more competitive offering to the long term rival [[BMW 5-Series]] (which previously was the preferred choice of the motoring media). Before [[North America]]n sales began, the car was shown in the [[2002 in film|2002 movie]] ''[[Men in Black II]]''.

The W211-based [[Mercedes-Benz W219|W219]] [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class|CLS-Class]] 4-door [[coupé]] was introduced as a niche model in 2005, primarily to attract a younger demographic.  

The W211 E-Class was face lifted in 2006 to address quality and technical issues raised by earlier models, [[Sensotronic]] was dropped, while [[precrash system|Pre-Safe]] (w/o brake support) was made standard. The largest factory built engine in the E-class range is the E500 (badged E550 in the U.S.) which had its engine size increased from 5 litres to 5.5 litres in 2006 along with the facelift. There is also an AMG model badged E63 [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] and other tuning house installations. 

Mercedes-Benz introduced their [[BlueTec]] [[Diesel engine|Diesel]] system to the E-Class at the 2006 [[North American International Auto Show]] as the E320 CDI BlueTec. BlueTec is a two-phase system for cleaning diesel emissions. The first phase makes the E320 CDI legal in 45 of the 50 [[United States]] (plus the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]). The second phase uses [[urea]] for further reductions to meet the more stringent standards of [[California]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York]], and [[Vermont]]. Sales of E320 CDI BlueTec began in autumn 2006 as a 2007 model, but 50-state legal models with urea injection will not be introduced until the 2009 model year.
