The '''Audi Steppenwolf''' was a [[concept car]] produced by [[Audi]] and presented at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in 2001. The Steppenwolf was a study for a three-door [[Compact SUV|compact]] [[crossover SUV]] based on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform|Volkswagen Group PQ34]] platform used in the contemporary [[Audi A3]] and [[Audi TT]]. Powered by a 3.2L V6 engine with [[four-wheel drive]], the Steppenwolf had several novel features, including four-level adjustable air suspension (similar to the [[Audi allroad quattro]]), a removable [[carbon fibre]] [[hardtop]] or optional soft top, and an electro-hydraulic [[parking brake]].

The Steppenwolf didn't result directly in a production model. However, six years later, Audi presented the Audi Cross Coup√© quattro, another concept car in the same class, and is planning a production version expected to be called the [[Audi Q3]] for 2010.
