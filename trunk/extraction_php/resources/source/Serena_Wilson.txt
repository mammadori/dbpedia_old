'''Serena Wilson''' ([[August 8]], [[1933]] &ndash; [[June 17]], [[2007]]), often known just as "Serena", was a well-known dancer, choreographer, and teacher who helped popularize [[belly dance]] in the [[United States]]. Serena's work also helped legitimize the dance form and helped it to be perceived as more than [[burlesque]] or [[stripping]]. Serena danced in clubs in her younger years, opened her own [[studio]], hosted her own [[television show]], founded her own dance troupe, and was the author of several books about belly dance.

==Early years==
Serena was born Serene Blake in 1933 in [[New York|New York's]] [[Bronx]]. Her parents were [[vaudeville]] performers with their own show, Blake & Blake, featuring a variety of comedy and musical [[number (music)|numbers]], some of which Serena performed in as a child. As a young adult,  Serena officially changed her name from "Serene" to "Serena".

Serena also began studying with famed dancer [[Ruth St. Denis]], well-known for her interpretations of [[Orient]]al and [[Orientalism|Oriental-style]] dance. In 1952, Serena married Alan (Rip) Wilson, a [[musician]], [[percussionist]], and [[bandleader|leader]] of a [[Dixieland]] band, a combination which complemented Serena's own background. In the mid-1950s, Serena gave birth to their son, Scott.

Not long after their marriage, Rip's band was booked for a [[gig (musical performance)|gig]] with a [[Middle East]]ern theme that required a [[belly dance]]r. In spite of the clash of styles, Rip quickly got hold of the music for popular Middle Eastern [[Traditional pop music|standards]] like [[Misirlou]], and recruited his wife to dance, which Serena felt her studies with St. Denis had prepared her for.

According to her husband, Serena's dance ended up being rather awkward, as she wasn't sure what to do with her hands.  She disguised this by carrying a [[vase]] on her shoulder throughout! The performance was nonetheless a success, inspiring Serena and Rip to pursue a life-long interest in Middle Eastern music and dance.

Rip took up Middle Eastern drumming and frequently accompanied Serena as she honed her skills dancing at the Egyptian Gardens club in [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]], an area then known [[colloquially]] as Greektown for the large number of [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Middle Eastern]] [[cabarets]] lining the street. Soon, Serena had become one of the most popular belly dancers in the city and even performed for various city officials.

==Middle Years==
In the mid-1960s, Serena began teaching belly dance, opening Serena Studios, on [[Eighth Avenue]] in [[New York City]]. In the 1970s she started her own TV show, known as "Serena" and "The Serena Show", which served as a means of educating the masses about belly dancing, and billed itself as "The fun way to beauty, grace, and a youthful figure."<ref name="serena show">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB76_4rSDS8&feature=related The Serena Show]
</ref>

Her son, Scott, continued the family tradition by dedicating himself to the study of the [[oud]], an [[Egypt]]ian [[lute]] or [[guitar]]. Serena also began writing the first two of her books about belly dance, ''The Serena Technique of Belly Dancing'' and ''The Belly Dance Book''.

Serena and Rip's success continued unabated until the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, when [[United States|American]] attitudes towards all things Middle Eastern soured.

==Later Years==
In spite of the bias in American popular culture against the Middle East, Serena continued to perform in a number of Egyptian folkloric shows and appeared several times as the lead dancer in the [[New York City Opera|New York Opera Company's]] production of [[Aida]].<ref name="serena studios">Serena Studios: [http://www.serenastudios.com About Serena].</ref> She also continued teaching at her studio and choreographing for her dance troupe, Serena Dance Theater, which performed throughout New York City. 

Serena's studio also provided dancers for hire, with dancers available for performances at traditional Middle Eastern weddings and other social events. Notably, in keeping with Serena's long-held belief that belly dancing was not comparable with [[stripping]] and [[erotic dance]], her studio would not provide dancers for events in which their performance might be over-[[sexualized]], e.g. for [[bachelorette party|bachelorette parties]], but not [[bachelor party|bachelor parties]], for [[bat mitzvahs]] but not [[bar mitzvahs]].<ref name="serena obituary">Fox, Margalit.

In June, 2007, Serena died suddenly of a pulmonary embolism. She had been scheduled to dance in [[Greenwich Village]] with her son's Middle Eastern band, Scott Wilson and Efendi, that very night. Her son Scott and husband Rip  continue to carry on her passion for Middle Eastern music and dance. Serena's studio in New York also continues to hold classes and provide dancers for performances.
