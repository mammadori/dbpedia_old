The '''968''' is a sports car sold by [[Porsche]] [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] from 1992 to 1995.  It took over the entry-level position in Porsche's lineup from the [[Porsche 944|944]], with which it shared about 20% of its parts. Ultimately, the 968 became the final model in an evolving line started almost 20 years earlier with the introduction of the [[Porsche 924|924]].

== Information ==
Porsche's 944 model debuted for the 1982 model year, was updated as "944S" in 1986 and as "944S2" in 1989. Shortly after the start of production of the S2 variant, Porsche engineers began working on another set of significant upgrades for the model, as executives were planning a final "S3" variant of the 944. During the development phase, 80% of the 944's mechanical components were either significantly modified or completely replaced by the engineers, leaving so little of the outgoing S2 behind that Porsche management chose to introduce the variant as a new model, titling it 968. In addition to the numerous mechanical upgrades, the new model also received significantly evolved styling both inside and out, with a more modern, streamlined look and more standard luxury than on the 944. Production was moved from the [[Audi]] plant in [[Neckarsulm]] (where the 924 and 944 had been manufactured under contract to Porsche), to Porsche's own factory in [[Zuffenhausen]].

The 968 was powered by an updated version of the 944's [[straight-4]] [[internal-combustion engine|engine]], now displacing 3.0&nbsp;L and producing 240&nbsp;[[Horsepower#PS|PS]] (236&nbsp;[[Horsepower#hp (SAE)|hp]]/177&nbsp;[[Watt|kW]]). Changes to the 968's [[powertrain]] also included the addition of Porsche's then-new [[VarioCam]] [[variable valve timing]] system, newly-optimized induction and [[exhaust system]]s, a dual-mass flywheel, and updated engine management electronics among other more minor revisions. The 968's engine was the second-largest 4-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] ever offered in a [[production car]] up to that time.  A new 6-speed [[manual transmission]] replaced the 944's old 5-speed, and Porsche's dual-mode [[Tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]] became an available option. Both the Variocam timing system and Tiptronic transmission were very recent developments for Porsche. The Tiptronic transmission had debuted for the first time ever only 3 years prior to the debut of the 968, on the 1989 [[Porsche 964|Type 964]] [[Porsche 911|911]]. The Variocam timing system was first introduced on the 968 and would later become a feature of the Type 993 air cooled six cylinder engine.

The 968's styling was an evolution on that of the outgoing 944, itself styled evolutionarily from the earlier 924, but elements were borrowed from the more expensive [[Porsche 928|928]] model in an attempt to create a "family resemblance" between models, and the swooping headlamp design, inspired by those of the [[Porsche 959|959]], previewed similar units found later on the [[Porsche 993|Type 993]] [[Porsche 911|911]]. Along with the new styling, the 968 featured numerous small equipment and detail upgrades, including a Fuba roof-mounted antenna, updated single lens tail lamps, "Cup" style 16" alloy wheels, a wider selection of interior and exterior colors, and a slightly updated "B" pillar and rear quarter window to accommodate adhesive installation to replace the older rubber gasket installation. Because some parts are interchangeable between the 968, 944 and 924, some enthusiasts purchase those parts from Porsche parts warehouses as "upgrades" for their older models.

Like the 944, the 968 was sold as both a [[coupe]] and a [[convertible]]. Much of the 968's chassis was carried over from the 944S2, which in itself shared many components with the 944 Turbo (internally numbered ''951''). Borrowed components include the [[Brembo]]-sourced 4-piston [[brake caliper]]s on all four wheels, [[aluminum]] semi-trailing arms and aluminum front A-arms, used in a [[Macpherson strut]] arrangement. The steel unibody structure was also very similar to that of the previous models. Porsche maintained that 80% of the car was new.

== 968 Clubsport ==
From 1993 through 1995, Porsche offered a lighter-weight "Club Sport" version of the 968 designed for enthusiasts seeking increased track performance. Much of the 968's luxury-oriented equipment was removed or taken off the options list; less sound deadening material was used, electrical windows were replaced with crank-driven units, stereo and A/C systems were optional rather than standard, and the sunroof was not available. In addition, Porsche installed manually adjustable lightweight racing seats rather than the standard power-operated leather buckets, a revised [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system optimized for track use, and larger wheels and tires. Club Sport models were only officially available in mainland Europe & Australia, although "grey market" cars found their way elsewhere.

A UK-only version called "968 Sport", was offered for 1994 and 1995, and was essentially a Club Sport model with electric windows and door locks, standard seats and uphostery, stereo system and sunroof. At £29,975, the 968 Sport was priced £5,500 lower than the standard 968, but had most of the latter's desirable "luxuries" and consequently outsold it by a large margin (306 of the 968 Sport models compared to 40 standard 968 coupés).<ref name=Morgan>Peter Morgan, ''Original Porsche 924/944/968'', Bay View Books, 1998</ref>

== 968 Turbo S ==
Porsche briefly produced a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] 968 sold as "Turbo S", a fairly odd naming choice for Porsche which usually reserves the added "S" moniker for models that have been tuned for more power over a "lesser" counterpart, such as with the 911 Turbo which has infrequently been available  in both "Turbo" and higher-performance "Turbo S" guise. Only 15 were produced in total and only for sale in mainland Europe. Tests conducted in 1993 produced a 0 to 60 miles-per-hour time of 4.7 seconds and a top speed of approximately 180 miles-per-hour, performance comparable to the much newer [[Porsche 996|Type 996]] 911.

== 968 Turbo RS ==
A further stripped out version of the Turbo S which was built for Porsche's customer race teams between 1992 and 1994, this variant was available in two states of tune; a 337 bhp version which was built to the German ADAC GT specification and used the K27 [[turbocharger]] from the Turbo S, and an international spec version which used a KKK L41 [[turbocharger]] producing 350bhp and was reduced to 1212&nbsp;kg in weight (the ADAC GT version had to have ballast added to bring the car up to the 1350&nbsp;kg minimum weight limit allowed by ADAC regulations).
Along with the 964 Turbo RS these were the only Porsches to have been given the Turbo RS designation.

== Historical significance ==
The 968 was Porsche's last new front-engined vehicle (of any type) before the introduction of the [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]] SUV in 2003 and was the company's last front-engined sports car until the Panamera. Its discontinuation in 1995 coincided with that of the [[Porsche 928|928]], Porsche's only other front-engined car at the time.

As of 2009, Porsche has not yet built another front-engined sports car, although a 4-door sports-touring sedan, called [[Porsche Panamera|Panamera]] began production in 2009, and a successor to the 928, based on that sedan's architecture, is predicted to follow.
