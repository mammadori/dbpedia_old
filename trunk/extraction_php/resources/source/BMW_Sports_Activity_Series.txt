The '''sports activity vehicle and coupe series''' is a marketing description by '''[[BMW]]''' to describe a line of vehicles that traditionally were in the [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] [[SUV|Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV)]] class.<ref>[http://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/us02.nsf/fwPressemappeFrame?readform&docid=0EE32DDC02C8D7C0C12575130072C9D4 2009 BMW Press Kit]</ref> 

Unlike traditional SUVs which are derived from the body-on-frame construction of light trucks, vehicles in the sports activity family are [[Crossover (automobile)|crossovers]] that are based upon [[unibody]] car platforms. BMW emphasized their sports-car like on-road ability, helping to distinguish this new series from others. The sports activity nomenclatures are indicative of the reality that for the most part, the vehicles are more "activity" based than "utility". The sports activity family of [[BMW]] automobiles are grouped by their X-series branding. 

The first official [[BMW]] to carry to sports activity series nomenclature was the [[1999]] [[BMW X5]] as a Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) which debuted at the North American International Auto Show in [[Detroit]].<ref>[http://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/us02.nsf/fwPressemeldungFrame?readform&docid=9399D79C6CDBFEABC1256BB9002A12B5 BMW Press Release for the release of the SAV]</ref>

*The [[BMW X3]] Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV)
