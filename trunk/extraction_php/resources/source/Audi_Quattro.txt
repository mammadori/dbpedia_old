The '''Audi Quattro''' is a road and [[rallying|rally car]], produced by the [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry|automobile manufacturer]] [[Audi]], part of the [[Volkswagen Group]]. It was first shown at the 1980 [[Geneva Motor Show]] on 3 March.<ref name="Quattro25">Audi of America Press Site [http://www.audiusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=211 25 Years of Audi Quattro] 22 February 2005</ref><ref name="AudiTradition">Audi Tradition [http://fourtitude.rely.net/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/6/1129/printer Audi Tradition at the Techno Classica 2005] 16 March 2005</ref>

The word ''quattro'' is derived from the [[Italy|Italian]] word for "four".  The name has also been used by Audi to refer to the [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] four-wheel drive system, or any four-wheel drive version of an Audi model. To avoid confusion, the original Quattro model is also commonly referred to as the '''Ur-Quattro''' - the "[[wikt:Ur-|Ur-]]" ([[German language|German]] for "primordial") is an [[augmentative]] prefix, in this case meaning "original", and is also applied to the first generation [[Audi S4]] and [[Audi S6]] models, as in "Ur-S4" and "Ur-S6".

The Audi Quattro was the first [[rallying|rally car]] to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of [[four-wheel drive]] in [[auto racing|competition racing]]. It won competition after competition for the next two years.<ref name="Quattro25"/>  To commemorate the success of the original vehicle, all subsequent Audis with their trademark [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] four wheel drive system were badged "quattro" with a lower case "q".  The original car with the upper case "Q" in the Quattro name is a collector's piece.

The Audi Quattro shared many components and the core of its body style with the [[Audi Coupé]], which was a member of the [[Audi 80#B2 (1978–86)|Audi 80 (B2)]] model range.<ref name="Quattro25"/> It was internally designated ''Typ 85'', a type number it shared with the [[Audi Coupé GT]], [[Audi Coupé quattro]] and [[Audi 4000CS quattro]].  Its characteristic flared wheelarches were styled by [[Martin Smith (designer)|Martin Smith]].

==Production history==
The idea for a high four-wheel drive car was proposed by Audi's chassis engineer, Jörg Bensinger, in 1977, when he found that the [[Volkswagen Iltis]] jeep, could outperform any other vehicle in snow, no matter how powerful. Bensinger's idea was to start developing an Audi 80 variant in co-operation with Walther Treser, Director of Pre-Development.<ref>[http://www.isham-research.co.uk/quattro/history.html History of the Audi ur-Quattro]</ref>

===European market===
[[Audi]] released the original Quattro to [[Europe]]an customers in late 1980,<ref name="Quattro25"/> making it both the first car to feature Audi's [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system (hence its name), and the first to mate four wheel drive with a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine.<ref name="Quattro25"/>

The original [[internal combustion engine|engine]] was the {{convert|2144|cc|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} (2.1&nbsp;L), [[straight-5|inline-5 cylinder]] 10&nbsp;valve [[overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]], with a [[turbocharger]] and [[intercooler]].  It produced {{convert|147|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} and [[torque]] of {{convert|285|Nm|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} at 3500&nbsp;rpm; propelling the Quattro from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} in 7.1s, and reaching a top speed of over {{convert|220|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Quattro25"/>

The engine was eventually modified to a {{convert|2226|cc|0|abbr=on}} (2.2&nbsp;L) inline-5 10&nbsp;valve, still producing{{convert|147|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, but with peak torque lower in the rev-range.<ref name="Quattro25"/>  In 1989, it was then changed to a {{convert|2226|cc|0|abbr=on}} inline-5 [[multi-valve|20v]] (2.2&nbsp;L&nbsp;20v) [[overhead camshaft#Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] setup producing {{convert|162|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, now with a top speed of {{convert|230|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Quattro25"/>

Audi Quattros are often referred to among owners and enthusiasts by their engine codes, to differentiate between the earlier and later versions: the earliest 2144&nbsp;cc 10v being the "WR" engine, the 2226&nbsp;cc 10v being the "MB" engine, and the later 20v being the "RR" engine.  Hence, Quattro models may be referred to as either the ''WR Quattro'', ''MB Quattro'', and ''RR'' or ''"20v" Quattro'', respectively.

Quattro car production was 11,452 vehicles over the period 1980–1991,<ref name="Quattro25"/><ref name="AudiTradition"/> and through this 11 year production span, there were no major changes in the visual design of the vehicle.  For the 1983 [[model year]], the dash was switched from an [[analog signal|analogue]] instrument cluster, to a green digital [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD) [[electronic instrument cluster]].  This was later changed in 1988 to an orange LCD electronic instrument cluster.  The interior was redesigned in 1984, and featured a whole new dash layout, new [[steering wheel]] design, and new centre console design, the switches around the instrument panel were also redesigned at this time.  In 1985 the dash changed slightly with harder foam and lost a diagonal stripe, the dash switches were varied slightly and the diff lock pull knob gave way to a two-position turning knob with volt and oil temp digital readouts.

External styling received very little modification during its production run.  Originally, the car had a flat fronted [[grille]] featuring four separate [[headlamp]] lenses, one for each of the low and high beam units.  This was altered for the 1983 model year, and replaced with combined units featuring a single lens, but housing twin reflectors.  This was changed again, for the 1985 model year, in what has become known as the 'facelift model' and included such alterations as a new sloping front grille, headlights, and trim and badging changes.  The RR 20v Quattro also featured a new three spoke steering wheel design, leather covering for door arm rests, gloveboxes, centre console and door pockets.  There was also a full length leather wrapped centre console running all the way to the rear seats.  20v was also the first Ur-Q to have "quattro" script interior with partial leather seats.  The floor on the drivers side had a bulge due to dual catalytic exhaust setup. The different models may be distinguished by the emblems on their boot lids: the WR had a vinyl 'quattro' decal or a brushed aluminium effect plastic emblem, the MB had chrome plated 'audi', 'audi rings' and 'quattro' emblems, whilst the RR had only chrome plated 'audi rings'.

The rear suspension was altered early on with geometry changes and removal of the rear anti-roll bar to reduce a tendency for lift-off oversteer. For the 1984 facelift, the wheel size went from 6x15" with 205/60-15 tyres to 8x15" wheels with 215/50-15 tyres. At the same time the suspension was lowered 20mm with slightly stiffer springs for improved handling. For 1987, the [[Torsen]] centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] was used for the first time, replacing the manual centre differential lock.<ref name="Quattro25"/>

===North American market===
Sales of the Quattro in [[North America]] began with the 1983 [[model year]], which were constructed concurrently, and were of the same design as, the [[Europe]]an 1982 models (they did not include the minor cosmetic changes of the European 1983 model) and continued through 1986.  Total sales in the USA were 664.  [[Canada|Canadian]] market received cars that were identical to the US cars with exception of the [[speedometer]], which was [[metric system|metric]] like the early Euro cars.  Official sales figures for Canada were 99, which included 61 in 1983, 17 in 1984, 18 in 1985 and 3 in 1986.  Although it's believed that there might have been up to 6 cars bought in 1986.

US/Canadian cars were also equipped with larger impact bumpers with built in shock absorbers, just like the rest of the 4000/Coupé models.  None of the cars came with [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS), however they were otherwise "loaded" with options, including [[air conditioning]], and in 90% of the cars, leather upholstery.  Most of the 1984 and 1985 Canadian models did not have [[sunroof]]s.  The remainder of the electric, [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and cosmetic updates took place at the same time as the European cars.  Out of 99 cars imported to Canada 35 are still known to be on the road.

The initial 2.1L (2144cc, engine code "WX") engine for US/Canadian models included minor component and [[engine control unit]] (ECU) changes, including lowered [[turbocharger]] boost pressure, different [[camshaft]], emission controls including [[catalytic converter]], and [[lambda]] [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] fuel control, which lowered power to {{convert|160|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.  Otherwise, mechanical specifications were identical to the European spec cars.  The WX engine was also used on [[Switzerland|Swiss]] and [[Japan]]ese market cars.  In fact Audi built 200 special edition cars in 1988 with WX engine and analogue instruments, the rest of the car was identical to the MB cars of that year.

The original Audi Quattro competition car debuted in 1980, first as a development car, and then on a formal basis in the 1980 Janner Rally in [[Austria]].  Largely based on the bodyshell of the road-going Quattro models (in contrast to the forthcoming Group B cars), the engine of the original competition version produced approximately {{convert|300|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.  In [[1981 World Rally Championship season|1981]], [[Michèle Mouton]] became the first [[female]] ever to win a world championship rally, piloting an Audi Quattro.<ref name="Quattro25"/>  Over the next three years, Audi would introduce the A1 and A2 evolutions of the Quattro in response to the new [[Group B]] rules, raising power from the [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[straight-5|inline 5-cylinder engine]] to around {{convert|350|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

The Quattro A1 debuted at the [[1983 World Rally Championship season|1983 season]] opener [[Monte Carlo Rally]], and went on to win the [[Swedish Rally]] and the [[Rally Portugal]] in the hands of [[Hannu Mikkola]].  Driven by [[Stig Blomqvist]], Mikkola and [[Walter Röhrl]], the A2 evolution won a total of eight world rallies; three in 1983 and five in [[1984 World Rally Championship season|1984]].

The Audi '''Sport Quattro''' was a Quattro programme car developed for [[homologation]] for [[Group B]] [[rallying]] in 1984, and sold as a production car in limited numbers.<ref name="Quattro25"/>  It featured an all [[aluminium alloy]] {{convert|2133|cc|1|abbr=on|lk=on}} (2.1&nbsp;L) [[multi-valve|20v]] [[overhead camshaft#Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] engine slightly smaller than that of the Audi Quattro (in order to qualify for the 3-litre engine class after the scale factor applied to turbo engines).  In road-going form, the engine was capable of producing {{convert|225|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}},<ref name="Quattro25"/> with the competition cars initially producing around {{convert|331|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Quattro25"/>

The vehicle also featured a body shell composed of [[carbon fiber reinforced plastic|carbon]]-[[kevlar]]<ref name="Quattro25"/> and boasting wider arches, wider wheels (nine inches as compared to the Ur-Quattro's optional eight inch wide wheel rim), the steeper windscreen rake of the Audi 80 (requested by the Audi Sport rally team drivers to reduce internal reflections from the dashboard for improved visibility) and, most noticeably, a {{convert|320|mm|1|abbr=on}} shorter wheelbase.  This was carried out in order to improve handling potential in the face of newer, smaller competition, such as the [[Lancia 037]] and the [[Peugeot 205|Peugeot 205 T16]], which had been purpose-built from the start for Group B rules.

A total of 224 cars of this "short version" Sport Quattro were built, and were offered for sale at a heady price of 203,850 German Marks.<ref name="Quattro25"/>

The '''Audi Sport Quattro S1''' was introduced at the end of 1984 as an update to the Audi Sport Quattro.  The car featured a [[straight-5|inline 5-cylinder engine]] that displaced {{convert|2110|cc|1|abbr=on|lk=on}} and produced an officially quoted figure of {{convert|350|kW|PS bhp|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name="Quattro25"/>  However, the [[turbocharger]] utilised a recirculating air system, with the aim of keeping the turbo spinning at high rpm, when the driver closed the throttle, either to back off during cornering, or on gearshifts.  This allowed the engine to resume full power immediately after the resumption of full throttle, reducing [[turbo lag]].  The actual power figure was in excess of {{convert|500|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} at 8000&nbsp;rpm.<ref name="Quattro25"/>

In addition to the improved power output, an aggressive aerodynamic kit was added that featured very distinctive wings and spoilers to the front and rear of the car to increase [[downforce]].  The weight was lightened to just {{convert|1090|kg|0|abbr=on}}, and now accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} in just 3.1 seconds.<ref name="Quattro25"/>  Some of the cars were supplied with a "power-shift gearbox", which is said to be a forerunner of today's [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG) technology.<ref name="Quattro25"/>

The S1 proved to be an immediate success in the rally circuit, helping [[Walter Röhrl]]<ref name="Quattro25"/> and Christian Geistdörfer win the [[1985 World Rally Championship season|1985]] [[Rallye Sanremo|San Remo Rally]].  A modified version of the S1, was also driven by [[Michèle Mouton]].<ref name="Quattro25"/>  The S1 evolution would become the final [[Group B]] car produced by [[Audi]], with the works team withdrawing from the Championship following the [[1986 World Rally Championship season|1986]] rally in Portugal.<ref name="Quattro25"/>

Twenty years after the cancellation of Group B, the Sport Quattro S1 was still widely regarded as the most powerful rally car ever fielded in international competition, with the final factory machines of 1986 rated at an incredible {{convert|441|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Quattro25"/>  In addition to Group B competition, the S1 won the 1985 [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]] with [[Michèle Mouton]] in the driving seat, setting a [[world record]] time in the process.  This victory was repeated in 1987, this time at the hands of [[Walter Röhrl]].
