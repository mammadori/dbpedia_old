'''Jerry Rubin''' ([[July 14]], [[1938]] – [[November 28]], [[1994]]) was a radical [[United States|American]] social activist during the 1960s and 1970s. He became a successful businessman in the 1980s.

==Early life==

Rubin was born in [[Cincinnati]], the son of a bread delivery man and union representative, and grew up in the then-upscale [[Avondale, Cincinnati, Ohio|Avondale]] neighborhood. 

Rubin's parents died within 10 months of each other, leaving Rubin the only person to take care of his younger brother, Gil, who was 13 at the time. Jerry wanted to teach Gil about the world and decided to take him to [[India]]. When relatives threatened to fight to obtain custody of Gil, based on his plans to go abroad with his brother, Jerry decided to take his brother to [[Tel-Aviv]] instead. Here Rubin studied sociology for 12 months whilst his brother, Gil, who had learned [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], later decided to stay in [[Israel]] and moved to a [[kibbutz]]. Before returning to social and political activism, Rubin made a controversial visit to Cuba, despite the law forbidding Americans to travel to Communist run countries. However, the trip (especially after an encounter with activist [[Che Guevara]]), proved to be highly inspirational to Rubin, and thus furthered his ambitions.

Rubin attended Cincinnati's [[Walnut Hills High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Walnut Hills High School]], co-editing the school newspaper, ''The Chatterbox'' and graduating in 1956. While in high school Rubin began to write for ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'', compiling sports scores from high school games. He later went on to graduate from the [[University of Cincinnati]], receiving a degree in [[sociology]].  Rubin attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1964, but dropped out to focus on [[social activism]].

==Social activism==
Rubin began to demonstrate on behalf of various left-wing causes after dropping out of [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. Rubin also ran for Mayor of Berkeley, receiving over twenty per cent of the vote, but having been unsuccessful, Rubin turned all his attentions to political protest.  His first protest was in Berkeley, protesting the refusal of a local grocer to hire [[African Americans]]. Soon Rubin was leading protests of his own. 

Rubin organized the VDC ([[Vietnam Day Committee]]), led some of the first protests against the war in [[Vietnam]], and was one of the founding members of the [[Youth International Party]] or Yippies, along with social and political activist [[Abbie Hoffman]]. He played an instrumental role in the anti-war demonstrations that accompanied the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]] by helping to organize the Yippie Festival of Life in Lincoln Park and speaking at an anti-war rally at the Grant Park bandshell on August 28, 1968. Violence between Chicago police and demonstrators (which an official government report called a "[[police riot]]") eventually led, in 1969, to the indictment of Rubin and seven others ([[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Rennie Davis]], [[John Froines]], [[David Dellinger]], [[Lee Weiner]], [[Tom Hayden]], and [[Bobby Seale]]) on several charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot.<ref>{{cite book

The defendants were commonly referred to as the "[[Chicago Eight]]." Seale, however, was later severed from the case after demanding the right to serve as his own lawyer and sentenced to four years for contempt of court, making the Chicago Eight the Chicago Seven. Rubin (along with the six other defendants) was found not guilty on the charge of conspiracy, but guilty (with four other defendants) on the charge of incitement. He was also sentenced by the judge to more than three years imprisonment for contempt of court. All the convictions for incitement were later thrown out by an appeals court who cited judicial and prosecutorial misconduct (the government bugged the offices of the defense team). Most of the contempt of court citations were also overturned on appeal.<ref>{{cite book

==Author==
Jerry Rubin's anti-establishment beliefs were put down in writing in his book, ''DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution,'' ([[Simon and Schuster]], 1970, ISBN 0-671-20601-X), with an introduction by [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Eldridge Cleaver]] and unconventional design by [[Quentin Fiore]]. In 1971 his journal, written while incarcerated in the [[Cook County Jail]], was published under the title ''[[We are Everywhere]],'' ([[Harper & Row]], ISBN  06-090245-0).  The book includes an inside view of the trial of the [[Chicago Seven]], but otherwise focuses on the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]], the [[Black Panthers]], [[LSD]], [[women's rights|women's liberation]] and his view of a coming revolution.  
In 1976, Rubin wrote another book entitled ''[[Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven]]'', which contained a chapter narrating his experience at an [[Erhard Seminars Training]] (EST) that was later included in the reader [["American Spiritualities."]] "Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven" is described as "tracing his personal odyssey from radical activist of the 60's to a practitioner in the growth potential movements of the 70's." <!-- [ref.http://www.thephildickian.com/political.html] -->

*''Do It!'' was also the inspiration for a track of the same name on the 1972 [[Aphrodite's Child]] album [[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]].[http://www.engelen.demon.nl/666.htm#DO%20IT] It was also the apparent inspiration for the titles of two other books: ''Eat It: A Cookbook'' by [[Dana Crumb]] and ''Grow It! The Beginner's Complete In-Harmony With Nature Small Farm Guide'' by [[Richard W. Langer]].

==Death==
On [[November 14]], [[1994]], Rubin [[jaywalking|jaywalked]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]], near [[UCLA]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It was a weekday evening and, as usual, traffic was heavy, with three lanes in each direction. A car swerved to miss Rubin, and a second car (immediately behind the first) was unable to avoid him. He was taken to the [[UCLA Medical Center]], where he died 14 days later. He is interred in the [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].
