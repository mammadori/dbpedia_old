The '''Volkswagen Concept R''' is a [[concept car]] developed by the [[Germany|German]] [[automaker]] [[Volkswagen]] and officially unveiled at the 2003 [[Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung|Frankfurt Auto Show]].  It is a study of a sporty two-seat [[roadster]] with [[mid-engine]] and [[rear wheel drive]].

The Concept R is powered by a [[V6]] 3.2&nbsp;L [[Fuel Stratified Injection|FSI]] [[petrol engine]] developing a maximum output of {{convert|265|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,250&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|320|Nm|ft.lbf|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,800&nbsp;rpm.  It is strong enough to accelerate the car from 0 to 100&nbsp;[[km/h]] in 5.3&nbsp;seconds and make it reach the electronically limited top speed of 250&nbsp;km/h (155&nbsp;mph).  Without the speed governor, the car would be even able to reach the top speed of 270 km/h (167&nbsp;mph).  The power is transferred to the road via a six-speed [[direct-shift gearbox]].

The designer team for this concept was led by [[Murat GÃ¼nak]] and [[Peter Schreyer]], and broke the ground for the Volkswagen brand in developing the roadster vehicle. At {{convert|162|in|mm}} of length, {{convert|69|in|mm}} of width and {{convert|48|in|mm}} of height, the Concept R roadster has almost the same length and width as the fifth generation [[Volkswagen Golf]] [[hatchback]], on whose platform it has been built.

The concept has some interesting design features such as the Volkswagen logo which is generated digitally by a display and begins to pulsate in the so-called [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]] screen when the driver turns on the ignition.  When the ignition is activated the pulse stops.  Also, its seats are not adjustable in any way and the driver must electrically move the polished metal information block of the instrument panel, including the steering wheel and pedal cluster back or forth to find the correct seating position.  For the first time in a sports car, the seats are filled with active foam which adapts to the body shape of the driver and passenger.

At a press dinner held during the 2005 [[North American International Auto Show]], [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]], the chairman of the [[Volkswagen Group]], confirmed that Volkswagen intended to build a production vehicle similar to this concept. {{As of|2009}}, no production model has appeared, however another, similar, concept car, the [[Volkswagen Concept BlueSport]] was unveiled at the 2009 [[North American International Auto Show]].<ref name="bluesport">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thecarconnection.com/marty-blog/1016791_2009-detroit-show-volkswagen-bluesport-concept|title=2009 Detroit Show: Volkswagen BlueSport Concept|last=Halvorson|first=Bengt|date=2009-01-11|work=TheCarConnection.com|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>
