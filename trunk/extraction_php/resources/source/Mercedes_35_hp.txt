The '''Mercedes 35 hp''' was a radical early car model designed in 1901 by [[Wilhelm Maybach]] and [[Paul Daimler]], for [[Emil Jellinek]]. Produced in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] by the [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG), it began the ''[[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]]'' line of cars. After the 1926 merger with Benz &amp; Cie., makers of Benz vehicles since 1871, the company name was changed to [[Daimler-Benz]]AG and the two model lines were merged to form the ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'' line of automobiles. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] AG merged with [[Chrysler]], becoming [[DaimlerChrysler]] AG until the demerger from / disposal of Chrysler in 2007, where the company name was changed to Daimler AG .

Unlike the previous generation of automobiles, which were modified [[stagecoach]]es, the ''Mercedes 35 hp'' is regarded nowadays as the first car like the modern ones
<ref name="stuff">http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1901-mercedes-35-hp.htm ''1901 Mercedes 35 HP'' at ''howstuffworks.com''</ref>: it bore a powerful [[petrol engine]], it was both wider and larger with a tailored steel [[chassis]], and its [[Center of mass|center of gravity]] was near the ground. Originally designed as a racing car, the ''Mercedes 35 hp'' was also made for normal road use.

==History==
===Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG)===
DMG was a car company based in [[Cannstatt]], Stuttgart, as the expansion of a previous company which was owned and run by [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]], who had also revolutionized the motor world by introducing the [[petrol engine]] and [[patent]]ing many other things. DMG built automobiles using the Daimler and Maybach's ''DMG-Phoenix'' engine of 8 [[Horsepower|hp]] with 4 [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinders]], first built in 1894, which had also been successfully used in many of the early European car races.

===Wilhelm Maybach===
In the 19th century, [[Wilhelm Maybach]]'s career as an industrial designer had been with [[Gottlieb Daimler]] in their Cannstatt workshop, at which together they had pioneered the petrol engine production and were responsible for designing and making some of the world's first automobiles. By 1900, Maybach was the [[Chief Engineer]] within the ''DMG'', which had been originated from their workshop, although never he got along with the new capitalist board. Also in 1900, Gottlieb Daimler died and his son Paul had taken his place beside Maybach.

===Emil Jellinek===
[[Emil Jellinek]] was a wealthy [[Austria]]n businessman and Austro-Hungarian diplomat living in [[Nice]] on the [[French Riviera]]. His ten year old daughter was named [[Mércédès Jellinek|Mércédès]], from the [[Spain|Spanish]] word meaning ''mercy'', given to her to commemorate her [[France|French]] mother's [[Sepharadi]] family background. Jellinek used to name his possessions after her, such as his mansions, the automobiles he sold, his racing car team, etc. He himself was often known as ''Monsieur Mercedes''.

As an avid fan of the ''DMG'' brand, Jellinek had signed up two ''DMG-Phoenix'', the predecessor of the ''Mercedes 35 hp'', for competing in the 1900 ''Nice-La Turbie'' race ([[March 30]]), introducing the ''Mercedes'' name then, after his own daughter, for both his racing team and its cars. A tragedy ensued when the chief mechanic of the DMG, Wilhelm Bauer who raced one of the cars, was killed after the first curve of the race. Consequently, the DMG canceled all further involvement in [[motorsport]].

Nonetheless, Jellinek persuaded the DMG for the design of a new model for competing again. 36 of these cars would be delivered, for the large sum of 500,000 [[German gold mark|goldmarks]]. He insisted that the powerful engine should be developed by both Maybach and Paul Daimler and be named ''Daimler-Mercedes'', after his daughter. Such renaming was granted because the ''Daimler'' brand of the DMG had been already conceded to the [[France|French]] ''[[Panhard]]'' carmaker for all France. Furthermore, Jellinek specified revolutionary improvements. Unlike the previous generation of cars, unstable motorized coaches of narrow high bodies which were so prone to overturn, the novel ''Mercedes'' should be longer, wider, and of a lower center of gravity. Also it would have a light steel body and strong chassis, onto which the engine would be firmly fixed near the ground and lowering the car's center of gravity.

In 1900, over the following months Jellinek oversaw the process closely at first through daily [[telegram]]s and traveling personally subsequently. Maybach tested the new car for the first time on [[November 22]] and Jellinek received his first delivery on [[December 22]], 1900.

==Further development==

In January 1901, Emil Jellinek's Mercedes team tested six of the new ''Mercedes 35 hp'' in the ''[[Grand Prix de Pau]]'', but the racecar was of a disappointing performance by multiple technical complications and enduring just for few laps. However in the ''Nice-La Turbie'' event of March 1901, it was much different. Jellinek participated through five ''Mercedes 35 hp'' and the German driver Wilhelm Werner. The cars dominated the race from start to finish with a record average speed of 51.4&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph), beating the previous 31.3&nbsp;km/h (20&nbsp;mph) and reaching top speeds of 86&nbsp;km/h (55&nbsp;mph). Those results easily outclassed all other competing cars in any capacity. The automotive world was so astonished that [[Paul Meyan]], director of the French Automobile Club, stated: "We have entered the Mercedes era".

In Stuttgart, DMG mounted two additional back seats on the ''Mercedes-35hp'', transforming it for a family car. Between March and August 1901, it manufactured two more ''Mercedes'' models, the 12/16 hp and the 8/11 hp. The ''Mercedes'' was so successful that the production lines of the DMG ran at full capacity. The ''Mercedes'' trademark was used on DMG production automobiles from June 23, 1902, to 1926. It was formally registered on [[September 26]], [[1902]].

In June 1903, Emil Jellinek changed his own name to Jellinek-Mercedes, stating: "This is probably the first time that a father has taken his daughter's name".

Often confused with this ''Mercedes'' automobile brand are the cars of the ''Daimler-Benz'' company, formed in a 1926 merger of DMG and [[Karl Benz]]'s ''[[Benz & Cie.]]'', which were called by a new brand name, ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'', regardless of in which plant they were produced after the merger. A commitment was made for the two companies to remain together until 2000. Mercedes-Benz has endured as one of the world's great brands and is now the property of Daimler AG. Over nineteen million automobiles have been sold using that brand name.

==Technical description==
===Dimensions===
The Mercedes 35 hp had a [[wheelbase]] of 2.345&nbsp;metres and a [[Track (automobile)|track]] of 1.400&nbsp;metres. Its wooden [[wheel]]s were all the same size.

The total weight was also dramatically reduced to 1,200 [[kilogram|kg]] by making the main [[chassis]] [[Frame (vehicle)|frame]] of pressed steel of carefully designed U-shaped cross section.

The relatively light engine (230 kg, 34.3 kilograms/hp) was mounted over the front [[axle]] without any extra sub frames and, so, its center of gravity was closer to the ground.

===Axles===
The wooden wheels of the Mercedes 35 hp were non-removable, featuring:
*12 [[spoke]]s
*steel covers
*nearly identical pneumatic [[tire]]s of 910x90-front / 1020x120-rear

There were two braking systems one hand operated and the other by foot.
*The main brake was the [[hand brake]] which acted on the rear wheels which had 30 centimeter [[drum brakes|drums]].
*The secondary, [[Left-foot braking|foot brake]], acted on the chain drive's intermediate shaft and was [[Water cooling|water-cooled]].

Both axles were rigid, equipped with semi-elliptic [[Spring (device)|springs]]. The steering-axles were designed to minimise transmission of road shocks to the driver.

The [[steering column]] was inclined backwards unlike the vertical shaft on many of its contemporaries.

===Drive system===
The engine of the Mercedes 35 hp was at the front of the car driving the rear wheels through a large [[roller chain]].
	
The [[Manual transmission|gearshift]] was at the driver's right side, featuring a gate change system with four forward speeds and a reverse gear. The drum like compact [[clutch]] system was attached to the [[flywheel]].

The flywheel consisted of a self-adjustable coil spring made up of wound spring steel. The tension at which the clutch operated was regulated by a conical cam.

===Engine===
The  main bearings were made of magnalium, an [[aluminium]] [[alloy]] with 5% of [[magnesium]]. The [[crankcase]] was also made of aluminium.

The four cylinders, cast in grey [[iron]] with fixed heads, gave a total [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of 5,918 [[cubic centimeter|cc]] (bore/stroke: 116x140&nbsp;mm), and were arranged in pairs each pair with a single spray-nozzle [[carburetor]].

The intake and exhaust valves were no longer opened by cylinder pressure but by camshafts at both sides of the engine driven by gears from the flywheel.

The engine also incorporated:
*low-voltage [[Magneto (electrical)|magneto]] with make and break spark ignition. This was fitted at Jellinek's demand, replacing the antiquated hot tube system.
*pumped water cooling system
*fan behind the radiator
The engine was started by a hand crank aided by the presence of a decompressor.

Maybach's tubular radiator, patented in 1897, known as a honeycomb radiator, was similar to the present time ones. Its rectangular [[grille]] had 8,070 pipes of 6x6&nbsp;mm each with a square cross section to improve airflow, and holding 9 litres of water. The airflow was assisted by a fan located behind the radiator.

The Mercedes 35 hp engine ran between 300 and 1000 rpm, the speed controlled by the driver using a lever on the steering wheel. Its peak output was 35&nbsp;hp at 950&nbsp;rpm.

The road car's average speed was 70-75&nbsp;km/h (45&nbsp;mph). The racing version achieved 85&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph).
