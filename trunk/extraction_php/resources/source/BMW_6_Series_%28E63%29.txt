The '''BMW E63/E64''' is the current model of the '''[[BMW 6 Series]]''' of [[luxury car|luxury]] [[coupé]]s, introduced in Autumn 2003 in Frankfurt Motor Show by [[Germany|German]] car manufacturer [[BMW]]. It comes as either a coupé or cabriolet (convertible) and in several engine variants ranging from a 3 litre [[straight-6]] to 5 litre [[V10 engine|V10]] in the [[BMW M6|M6]] model.

In 1989 the original [[BMW 6 Series|6 Series]] was supplanted by the more expensive and higher performance [[BMW 8 Series|8 Series]]. In late 2003, the [[BMW 6 Series|6 Series]] was reintroduced as a 2004 model, with coupé and convertible versions based on the BMW E63 and BMW E64 platforms, respectively. The E63/64 itself is based on the [[BMW E60]], the latter which forms the current iteration of the [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series]] sedan.

==Engines==
These two models are each available with either a 3.0&nbsp;L (2996&nbsp;cc) [[straight-6]] [[BMW N52#N52B30|N52]] engine producing {{convert|190|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|300|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of torque from 2500–4000&nbsp;rpm (in the '''630i'''), a 4.4&nbsp;L (4398&nbsp;cc) [[V8]] making {{convert|245|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|450|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of torque at 3600&nbsp;rpm (in the '''645Ci''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmw.com/generic/com/en/products/automobiles/showroom/6series/coupe/index.html |title=BMW AG : Products : 6 Series Coupé |publisher=Bmw.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>  or In Europe a diesel engined variant (the 635d) is available. This has the same 3.0 L6 twin turbo diesel engine as in the 535d and 335d. It has {{convert|286|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm and {{convert|580|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of torque available at 1750 rpm. The 645 models have now been phased out in the favor of the more powerful 650i and they are now called 650i Coupé and 650i Cabriolet. (no Ci anymore in the naming) The 630i is not available on US market. It is available in Europe as both Coupé and Cabriolet.

The V8 in the 645Ci is the [[BMW N62|N62]] engine, the same powerplant used in the 545i and 745i, with [[BMW]]'s [[Valvetronic]] variable valve timing system. This is an all aluminum engine with 4 valves per cylinder. This 6-Series comes with either a 6 speed automatic transmission or a 7 speed [[SMG]] sequential gear box. For the 2006 model year, BMW remodeled the 645Ci as the 650i. The reason for this change was the increase in engine displacement. A manual transmission is also available.

Various auto tuners offer aftermarket products for the BMW E63/E64 that include improved engine software, throttle bodies, and exhaust sets that improve horsepower through the power band.

==Styling==
Unlike that of the new [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series]] and [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]] models, the styling of the new 6 Series has generally received a warm welcome from the BMW community—except, largely, owners and enthusiasts of the E24. The new 6 Series was designed to look like a shark, and many have acknowledged the resemblance.  The controversial rear styling is considered to work somewhat better on the shapely E63 than on other BMWs.

==Autumn 2007 update==
In the autumn of 2007 BMW debuted an updated BMW 6-Series Coupe and Convertible. They feature new LED turn signals in the headlights, slightly restyled rear tail lamps with an LED turn signal, and a redesigned third LED brakelight that has been enlarged and moved to the top of the trunklid.

==M6==
{{main|BMW M6}}
In 2005, an [[BMW M6#E63.2F64 M6|M6]] version of the new 6 Series was introduced. It shares the [[BMW E60|E60]] [[BMW M5]]'s engine and transmission (500 hp). In the third quarter of 2006, BMW announced the [[BMW M6#E63.2F64 M6|M6]] convertible as an upcoming 2007 model. The 2008 model year [[BMW M6#E63.2F64 M6|M6]] Coupé and Cabriolet both benefited from the standard 6-Series refresh during the fall of 2007.
