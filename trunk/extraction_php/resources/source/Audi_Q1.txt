The '''Audi Q1''' is a name commonly used for a proposed [[mini SUV|mini]] [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]] from the German carmaker [[Audi]]. It is expected to be based on the [[Volkswagen Group A0 platform|Volkswagen Group PQ24 platform]], shared by the [[Volkswagen Polo]], [[Å koda Fabia]] and [[SEAT Ibiza]] superminis.

The Q1 designation is merely for model reference purposes in relation to the [[Audi Q5]] and [[Audi Q3]].

The Q1 would slot below the upcoming Audi Q3, and would similarly be required to not use the "Q" designation in its name in the [[United States]] as an agreement with the carmaker [[Infiniti]] requires. No firm plans by Audi to produce the Q1 have been published so far.
