The '''GINA Light Visionary Model''' is a fabric-skinned [[shape-shifting]] sports car [[concept car|concept]] built by [[BMW]]. GINA stands for "Geometry and functions In 'N' Adaptions".<ref name=Wired>[http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/06/bmw-builds-a-ca.html], GINA on Wired.</ref><ref name=GINAx>[http://www.baekdal.com/design/automotive/bmw-gina/] BMW GINA&nbsp;— Design Feature.</ref><ref name=autoweek>[http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080610/FREE/916890563/1023], GINA on Autoweek.</ref> It was designed by a team led by BMW’s head of design, [[Chris Bangle]], who says GINA allowed his team to "challenge existing principles and conventional processes."<ref name=Wired/> Other designers include Anders Warming.<ref>[http://www.bmwism.com/bmws_designers.htm BMW Car Designers throughout history]</ref>

The construction began in 2001.<ref>[http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/223443/bmw_gina_concept.html BMW GINA concept - German giant reveals GINA concept with moving bodywork.]</ref>

== Fabric body ==
BMW says the flexible, stretchable [[Waterproofing|water resistant]] [[translucent]] man-made fabric skin&nbsp;– [[polyurethane]]-coated [[Spandex]], is resilient and durable. It resists high or low temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not slacken or damage the fabric.<ref name=AOL>[http://aol.whatcar.com/news_article.asp?NA_ID=233198&type=autocar] GINA on AOL.</ref> The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The fabric is stretched over a moveable frame;<ref name=Wired/> essential shapes are formed beneath the skin by an [[aluminium]] wire structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used.<ref name=Wired/> The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators, for example, the [[headlights]] are revealed when small motors pull the fabric back in an [[eyelid]] like fashion. As the fabric is translucent the taillights shine through it.

== Exterior ==
GINA has just four panels&nbsp;— the [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]], the two side panels and the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]].<ref name=Wired/> Its skin appears seamless, but it can “grow” a higher rear spoiler for stability at high speed.<ref name=AOL/> Its doors open in a [[Butterfly doors|butterfly style]], and are each covered by a fabric piece reaching all the way from the nose of the car to their trailing edge which when closed leaves a perfectly smooth surface. Access to the engine can be gained through a slit that can open in the middle of the bonnet. <ref name=Wired/>

== Interior ==
When the car is parked, the car’s [[steering wheel]] and instruments sit in an ‘idle’ position on the centre console to allow the driver easy entry.<ref name=AOL/> The steering wheel and instruments assume their correct positions when the driver presses the start button and the [[headrest]] rises from the seat once the driver is seated, making it easier to  get in and out of the car.<ref name=Wired/><ref name=autoweek/>
