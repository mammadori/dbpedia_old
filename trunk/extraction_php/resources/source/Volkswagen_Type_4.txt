The '''Volkswagen Type 4''' was a mid-sized 2 or 4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]] or 2-door [[station wagon|estate]] built by [[Volkswagen]] (VW) of [[Germany]]. It was introduced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in October 1968<ref name=Autocar1968>{{cite journal| authorlink = Unsigned| title = News and Views: What's new at Paris| journal = [[Autocar]]| volume = vol 129 (nbr 3790)| pages = page 59 |date = date 3 October 1968}}</ref> and withdrawn from sale in 1974.

The Type 4 was larger than the [[Volkswagen Type 3]] and had a more powerful engine (1.7 - 1.8 litres, as opposed to 1.5 - 1.6 for the Type 3). The Type 3 and Type 4 were the last of the company's [[air-cooled]] models apart from the vanagon Type 2 bus range which continued until 1983 (and had an updated version of the type 4 fuel injected engine), and followed on from the [[Volkswagen Type 1]] ("Beetle"). They were succeeded by the massively successful [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf/Rabbit]] and [[Volkswagen Passat|Dasher/Passat]].

==Features==
[[Image:VW 411 LE 1971 2.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Volkswagen 411LE.]]The Type 4 introduced many firsts to the Volkswagen range. These included: [[unibody]] construction, [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension, rear suspension with coil springs and trailing wishbones, a hydraulic clutch (for models equipped with a [[manual transmission]]), and one of the first [[automatic transmission|fully automatic transmissions]] (the first was in the 1969 Type 3 models) in a Volkswagen. (Previous cars had used an automatic (vacuum-actuated) clutch, but gears still had to be changed manually.) The Type 4 was also Volkswagen's first 4-door car. The MacPherson strut front suspension was later successfully employed in the [[VW Beetle|1302/1303]] ("Super Beetle").

The Type 4's battery was located under the driver's seat. In the rear of the car was located a [[Gasoline heater|gasoline-operated heater]] (an [[Eberspächer]] BA4) that was fired by a glow plug accessible from a hidden rear window deck plate.

==Models==
[[Image:Volkswagen 411 Front view Essex.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Volkswagen 411 4-door saloon. 1968 models, without fuel injected motors, are distinguished by their unusually shaped single headlamp covers.]]
The Type 4 was marketed as the Volkswagen 411, produced from 1968 to 1972, and, modestly improved, as the 412 from 1972 till 1974. Both ranges included a [[fastback]] saloon and an estate version. The car at launch came with a 1679 cc twin carburettor engine: just one year later, in 1969, this was replaced with a fuel injected unit, increasing claimed power output from 68 to {{convert|80|bhp|abbr=on}}, and making this one of the first mass production vehicles to include the feature &mdash; along with the Volkswagen Type 3, which also had received electronic fuel injection in 1968.   Fuel injection was indicated by the suffix letter 'E' (for ''Einspritzung'') in the model's name:  the 411E's {{convert|80|bhp|abbr=on}} engine was shared with the mid-engined [[Porsche 914]] also launched in 1969.  The most obvious visual change in 1969 was the replacement of single rectangular headlights, behind windcheating covers, with uncovered twin headlights  
[[Image:Typ 4 412 Variant aus Offenbach.JPG|thumb|1974 Volkswagen 412 estate.]]
Towards the end of 1973 the '''Volkswagen 412''', featuring a slightly larger, 1795 cc engine, replaced the 411.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1974/>  Fuel feed reverted to a twin carburettor system.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1974/>  The 412's headlight surround was reshaped and the nose panels were redesigned, to give the car a slightly less bland look.

The design of the Volkswagen 412 Variant was followed when the [[Volkswagen Brasilia]] was produced in [[Brazil]], primarily for the [[Latin America]]n markets.

==Sales and marketing==
Even after five years of disappointing sales, no attempt was made to have the car compete on price, suggesting that the Type 4 was probably not particularly cheap to produce.   In February 1974 on the domestic market the 4-door 412L was priced at DM 10,995 (DM 11,145 for the 412 LS).<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1974/>   The price setter in the sector was probably the [[Opel Rekord]] which was offered in 1700 cc guise for DM 10,823, itself fractionally undercut by the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Consul 1700]] at DM 10,740.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1974/>   The West German government was at this time cultivating currency stability, and from across the [[River Rhine|Upper Rhine]] the 1800 cc [[Peugeot 504|Peugeot 504 L]] was offered at a challenging DM 10,195.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1974/>   Unfortunately, however, even in its home country, the verdict of the market place did not support Volkswagen's evident belief that the 412 deserved to command a price premium on account of its Volkswagen qualities.

During a six year production span, just 367,728 Type 4s were produced. That was better than the 210,082 achieved by the contemporary [[Volkswagen K70]] (which effectively had only a four year model life). Nevertheless, Type 4 sales levels must have been disappointing when set against the volumes achieved by the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Type 1 (Beetle)]] and [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3]] models.  The domestic market dominance of [[General Motors|GM]]'s [[Opel Rekord]], its production running at about 300,000 cars annually, was not seriously threatened by Volkswagen's 411/412 in the family sedan sector.

In the United States, where the Type 4 was on sale for four seasons, it was regarded as too underpowered. The Type 4 was in fact a sales disaster in the U.S., selling only 117,110 units over a four-year-period.

==Popular perception==
In contemporary German vernacular, the 411 was called "Nasenbär" ("[[coati]]") or "Vier Türen elf Jahre zu spät", meaning "four doors coming eleven years too late" because it was Volkswagen's first 4-door sedan. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.   (The [[Opel Rekord]] had been offered with four doors only since 1959 while its Vauxhall counterparts were always four-door-only, and starting in 1957 [[Auto Union]] had offered a four door version of [[Auto Union 1000|their small family sedan]].)

==The powerplant lived on==
{{main|Volkswagen air cooled engine}}
While the Type 4 was discontinued in 1974 when sales dropped, its engine became the power plant for [[Volkswagen Type 2]]s ("Kombis") produced from 1972 to 1979: it continued in modified form in the later "Vanagon" which was air-cooled from 1980 until mid-1983. The engine that superseded the Type 4 engine in late 1983 retained Volkswagen Type 1 architecture, yet featured water-cooled cylinder heads and cylinder jackets. The [[Wasserboxer]], VW speak for a water-cooled, opposed-cylinder (flat or [[boxer engine]]), did not enjoy the reputation for longevity that the original air-cooled design had forged. From the very start, the engine suffered cylinder-to-head sealing problems, mostly due to [[galvanic corrosion]], often a result of slack maintenance schedules. Volkswagen discontinued the engine in 1992, upon the introduction of the Eurovan.
