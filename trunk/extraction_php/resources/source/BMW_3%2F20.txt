The '''BMW 3/20 PS''' was the first BMW automobile designed entirely by BMW.  It was manufactured from 1932 to 1934, replacing the 3/15 model that was initially an [[Austin 7]] manufactured under licence from the [[Austin Motor Company]].

The engine used in the 3/20  was based on the Austin Seven engine used in the 3/15, but its crankshaft ran in plain bearings instead of roller bearings and had an {{convert|80|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke, generating a displacement of {{convert|788|cc|CID|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Norbye30 />  The new engine design also had a water pump and an [[overhead valve]] [[cylinder head]]. These design changes caused the engine to generate 20&nbsp;hp, but did not change the taxable horsepower rating of 3 PS, thus giving the model designation 3/20. <ref name="unixnerd.demon.co.uk" />

The 3/20 was larger than the 3/15, with an {{convert|84.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and a body {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} lower than the 3/15.<ref name="unixnerd.demon.co.uk">Unixnerd: BMW's Early History</ref>. It inherited the 3/15 DA-4's [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]] and added a [[swing axle]] [[independent rear suspension]], using a transverse leaf spring similar to that used at the front.<ref name=Norbye30 /> 

Journalist and engineer [[Josef Ganz]], who had criticized the 3/15 DA-4's suspension system in the magazine ''[[Motor-Kritik]]'',<ref name=MotorKritik>Article ‘''Die Schwingachse des Kleinen'',’ ''Motor-Kritik'' magazine, issue 3, early February 1931</ref>, was contracted in July 1931 as a consultant in the design of the 3/20 AM-1.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Four versions of the 3/20 were built: AM 1, AM 2, AM 3 and AM 4, where AM denoted ''Automobil München''.<ref name=Norbye30 />
