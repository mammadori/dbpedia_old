The '''Audi Coupé GT''' ('''''Typ'' 85''') is a two-[[vehicle door|door]] [[coupé]] produced and sold by [[Audi]] from 1980 to 1987.  The car was an attempt by Audi to offer a cheaper version of its [[turbocharger|turbocharged]], [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] [[Audi Quattro]] - without turbochargers or four wheel drive.

The Coupé GT featured a similar body shape to the Quattro, but without the knife-edged fender flares of the more expensive car.  Mechanically, the biggest changes from the Quattro to the GT were the use of a [[naturally-aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] 1.9&nbsp;[[litre]] carburetter [[petrol engine]], 2.0&nbsp;litre, 2.2, or 2.3&nbsp;litre [[fuel injection|fuel injected]] [[straight-five engine|inline five cylinder]] engine and a [[front-wheel drive]] [[powertrain|drivetrain]].  Although some later Coupé GTs were also fitted with a [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#DZ|1.8&nbsp;litre]] injected [[inline-four engine|inline four cylinder]] engine.

From late 1984, Audi made available the option of the [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system to produce the [[Audi Coupé quattro]], a model which was rarer than the turbocharged Quattro model.  This was only produced with the 2.2&nbsp;litre engine.

From September 1980 to September 1987, 174,687 Coupé GTs were built.<ref>Werner Oswald: ''Deutsche Autos 1945-1990'', vol. 4, ISBN 3-613-02131-5, p. 263.</ref>
