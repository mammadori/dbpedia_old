The '''BMW Concept X6 ActiveHybrid''' is the concept vehicle of [[BMW]]s first full-hybrid vehicle and was revealed at the [[Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung]] Frankfurt in September 2007. BMWs first mild-hybrid [[BMW Concept 7 Series ActiveHybrid]] was revealed at the Paris Motor Show in October 2008. Both cars will make their market debuts at the end of 2009 <ref>[http://jalopnik.com/cars/frankfurt-auto-show/frankfurt-auto-show-bmw-x6-activehybrid-concepts-298085.php jalopnik.com: Frankfurt Auto Show: BMW X6, ActiveHybrid Concepts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and can drive in electrical mode at low speeds. 

The BMW Concept X6 ActiveHybrid uses the V8 Twin Turbo with High Precision Injection that powers the BMW X6 xDrive50i.  

A defining feature of the BMW Concept X6 ActiveHybrid is its Two-Mode active transmission, an innovative technology that controls the interplay of the electrical motors and the internal combustion engine. The car can operate in two modes: mode 1 delivers high torque when pulling away from a standing start and at low speeds, while mode 2 is suited for higher speeds. The result is that the car always uses the available power resources in the most efficient possible way, whatever speed it is travelling at. 

The [[BMW_X6#ActiveHybrid_X6_.282009-.29|ActiveHybrid X6]] made its world premiere at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] (IAA) in September 2009.

It extends the current BMW X model line up, currently consisting of the [[BMW X1]], [[BMW X3]], [[BMW X5]] and the [[BMW X6]].
