'''Mercedes-AMG GmbH''', commonly known as '''AMG''', is a subsidiary of the [[Mercedes-Benz]] car company specializing in [[Sports sedan|high-performance luxury cars]].

AMG models are typically the most expensive and highest-performance of each nameplate. AMG models typically have more aggressive looks, higher performances, better handling and better stability than their regular Mercedes counterparts.<ref>[http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/06q4/2008_mercedes-benz_cl63_amg_and_s63_amg-first_drive_review]</ref>

==History==
AMG was founded as a racing engine forge in 1967 under the name ''AMG Motorenbau und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH'' (''AMG Engine Production and Development, Ltd.''), by former Mercedes engineers [[Hans Werner Aufrecht]] and [[Erhard Melcher]] in [[Burgstetten|Burgstall an der Murr]], near [[Stuttgart]]. The letters "AMG" stand for Aufrecht, Melcher and [[Aspach, Baden-Württemberg|Großaspach]], Aufrecht's birthplace (but at no time an AMG location). In 1976 most of AMG moved to [[Affalterbach]], with the racing engine development remaining at the old location in Burgstall. At this time Erhard Melcher ceased to be a partner, but continued to be an employee at the Burgstall location.

In 1990, with AMG having become a high-profile purveyor of modified Mercedes cars, Daimler-Benz AG and AMG signed a contract of cooperation, allowing AMG to leverage Daimler-Benz's extensive dealer network and leading to commonly developed vehicles (the first one being the Mercedes-Benz C 36 AMG, in 1993). On 1 January 1999 DaimlerChrysler, as it was called between 1998 and 2007, acquired 51 percent of AMG shares, and AMG was renamed to Mercedes-AMG GmbH.<ref>{{cite web | last = Newhardt | first = David | title = Behind the Scenes: Mercedez-Benz AMG | publisher = [http://www.motortrend.com MotorTrend.com] | url = http://www.motortrend.com/features/scenes/112_0009_dreamfac/ | accessdate = 2008-03-22 }}</ref> Racing engine development was divested and continues to exist in Burgstall under the name [[HWA AG|HWA]] (Aufrecht's initials). On 1 January 2005 Aufrecht sold his remaining shares to DaimlerChrysler, and since then it has been a wholly-owned subsidiary.

===Development of the product range===
[[Image:Mercedes AMG C63 W204 amk.jpg|thumb|AMG logo on a Mercedes C63 AMG (W204)]]
AMG started off by designing and testing racing engines. It expanded its business into building ''[[custom]]'' road cars based upon standard Mercedes cars.

AMG initially produced a range of unofficial upgrade and accessories packages mainly for the [[Mercedes-Benz W107]],<ref name="Motor Trend">Hall, Jim. "Rhapsody in Red: 500SL AMG" ''Motor Trend Magazine'', October, 1983.</ref> [[Mercedes-Benz W126]], [[Mercedes-Benz W124]], [[Mercedes-Benz R129]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W201]] models. There were no official tie-ups until the mid 1980s, when AMG started to supply the company with aftermarket alloy wheels and automotive styling products. Typical AMG cosmetic and performance enhancements from 1979 to 1985, which could all be custom ordered by the buyer, included 15" or 16" [[ATS (wheels)|ATS]] for AMG 5 spoked Penta wheels, [[Recaro]] seats, painting of all external chrome parts to the car's body color or to black, a smaller diameter AMG steering wheel, lowered and stiffened suspension, [[aerodynamic]] AMG front air dam and spoiler kit, modified cams, a custom exhaust to increase base [[horsepower]], and a 5 speed manual transmission.<ref name="Motor Trend"/>

[[Image:Ats amgpenta.jpg|thumb|AMG Penta 5 Spoke 16x8 type 1 wheel]]
The release of the AMG Hammer sedan in 1986, based on the [[Mercedes-Benz W124]], took AMG's performance modifications for a fast compact sedan to a new level. AMG made the world's fastest passenger sedan at the time, nicknamed the Hammer<ref name="Auto Week">"AMG's Hammer" ''Auto Week'', June 23, 1986.</ref>, by squeezing Mercedes 5.6-liter V8 tuned by AMG to 360&nbsp;hp into a midsized 300-series sedan. It was very aggressive for the era, with 32-valve cylinder heads and twin camshafts, and said to be faster than the [[Lamborghini Countach]] from 60 to 120&nbsp;mph.<ref name="Car Magazine">Setright, LJK. "Firebrand: AMG Hammer Sedan" ''Car Magazine'', December, 1986. Pp.149-155</ref> Later models were even more powerful and introduced the 17" AMG Aero 1 Hammer wheels.

Through the early 2000s, AMG focused principall on [[supercharged]] engines, but the company officially abandoned this technology in 2006 with the introduction of the [[Mercedes-Benz M156 engine|M156 V8]].  On [[16 January]] 2006, Mercedes-AMG Chairman Volker Mornhinweg told [[AutoWeek]] that the company would use [[turbocharging]] for higher output rather than supercharging.<ref>[http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060120/FREE/60116017/1024/LATESTNEWS AMG's new chief has big plans for 2006 - AutoWeek Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Motor racing===
[[Image:DTM Mercedes AMG.jpg|thumb|Mercedes AMG DTM car (2003)]]

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, AMG entered the big [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3]] V8 saloon, affectionately named the "Red Sow", in the 1971 [[Spa 24 Hours]], and the [[European Touring Car Championship]]. AMG and Mercedes worked together on [[Mercedes-Benz W201]] cars for the 1988 [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM, German Touring Car Championship). AMG was made the official partner.

When DaimlerChrysler acquired a majority share of AMG in 1999, the motor racing department was divested into [[HWA|HWA GmbH]]. Their first car was the ill-fated [[Mercedes-Benz CLR]]. Since 2000, HWA builds and runs the cars for [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (DTM), as well as the M271 engine tuned for use in [[Formula 3]].

Six successive lightly modified Mercedes-Benz AMG models (including, most recently, an SL 63 AMG) have acted as the [[safety car]]s for the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Formula One]] World Championship.

===Relationship with Pagani===
AMG also provides engines for the [[Pagani]] [[Pagani Zonda|Zonda]] [[supercar]].  The engines used are variants of the [[Mercedes-Benz M120 engine|M120]] 7,291cc displacement [[V12 engine]] originally used in the [[SL-Class#AMG|SL73 AMG]]. The M120 is the largest displacement naturally-aspirated engine provided by AMG and is now exclusively used by Pagani.

==Current AMG models==
All AMG [[internal combustion engine|engines]] are hand built, using a "one man, one engine" philosophy at the current AMG plant in Affalterbach, Germany. To signify this, each AMG engine builder stamps the engines they produce with an engraved plaque depicting their signature.

As part of the official Mercedes product line, the AMG models are sold side-by-side with regular production models, unlike those offered by other Mercedes tuning firms such as [[Brabus]].

===55===
The main engine is a 5.5&nbsp;L [[V8 engine]], designated the [[Mercedes-Benz M113 engine|M113]], that carries the "55" designation. This engine comes in two configurations.
* The first configuration is a naturally aspirated V8 with {{convert|360|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} that is used in compact cars, namely the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|C55 AMG]], [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class|CLK55 AMG]] and [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class|SLK55 AMG]] .
* The other configuration is a similar unit but with a highly efficient [[Twin-screw type supercharger|Lysholm]] type [[supercharger]] manufactured by IHI, is found in the rest of the AMG 55 models which are typically midsized or larger vehicles.  The ''published'' output according to Mercedes varies from {{convert|476|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} to {{convert|517|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} and {{convert|700|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} to {{convert|720|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}}, depending on various methods of power measurements and different [[Engine Control Unit|ECU]] programming for national legislations.

AMG phased out both the naturally aspirated and supercharged 5.4&nbsp;L engines in favor of the new [[Mercedes-Benz M156 engine|M156]] V8 beginning in 2006.

For the Model Year 2009:
* [[Mercedes-Benz M113 engine|M113]] 5.4&nbsp;L "55" V8 models ([[naturally aspirated]])
**[[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class|SLK55 AMG]]
* [[Mercedes-Benz M113 engine|M113]] 5.4&nbsp;L "55" V8 models ([[supercharged]])
**[[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|G55 AMG]]

===63===
AMG developed its own [[V8 engine]] (dubbed [[Mercedes-Benz M156 engine|M156]] in development) for the DTM series.  This [[naturally aspirated]] V8 will also be used to replace most of the "55" models.  The ''published'' output according to Mercedes varies from {{convert|457|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} on the C63AMG, to {{convert|525|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} on the C/CLK/R/ML/GL/S/SL/CL/E 63 AMG.

Despite its badging, the 2001 [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S63 AMG]] and 2001 [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class|CL63 AMG]] have completely unrelated engines, sporting a [[naturally aspirated]] 6.3L V12 producing 444 PS (438&nbsp;hp/327&nbsp;kW).

In 2009, AMG developed M159 engine which based in M156, used in [[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG|SLS AMG]].

===65===
These are the only AMG vehicles using a [[5G-Tronic|5-speed automatic transmission]], as the newer [[7G-Tronic]] cannot handle the torque from the V12 engines.
