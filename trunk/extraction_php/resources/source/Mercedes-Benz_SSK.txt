The '''Mercedes-Benz SSK''' is a [[roadster]] built by [[Germany|German]] [[automobile manufacturer]] [[Mercedes-Benz]] between 1928 and 1932. Its name is an [[acronym]] of ''Super Sport Kurz'', with the last word being the German for "short", a reference to the fact that the car was based on the earlier [[Mercedes-Benz S]], but with {{Convert|19|in}} chopped from the [[chassis]] to make the car lighter and more agile for [[auto racing|racing]].<ref name="top10_MB">[http://cars.uk.msn.com/News/Top_ten_article.aspx?cp-documentid=544788 "Top 10: greatest-ever Mercedes"], Henry Biggs, [[MSN|MSN Cars]]</ref> It was the last and greatest car designed for the company by the brilliant [[engineer]] [[Ferdinand Porsche]], before he left to pursue the foundation of his own company.<ref name="porsche964">[http://www.porsche964.co.uk/history/ferdbio.htm "Ferdinand Porsche 1875 – 1951"], Prescott V.

Fewer than 40 SSKs were built during its production span, of which about half were sold as ''Rennwagen'' (racing cars).<ref name="sportscarmarket">[http://www.sportscarmarket.com/Profiles/2003/September/German/ "1929 Mercedes-Benz SSK Roadster"], Keith Martin's [[Sports Car Market]], September 2003</ref> Fitted with a [[supercharged]] seven [[litre]] [[straight-6]] [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] producing {{Convert|200|-|300|PS|kW|lk=on}} and over {{convert|500|lb·ft|N·m|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] (depending on the [[engine tuning|state of tune]]),<ref name="trossi">[http://www.supercars.net/cars/1219.html "1930 Mercedes-Benz 710 SSK Trossi Roadster"], supercars.net</ref> it was driven to victory in numerous races, including the 1929 500 Miles of Argentina, the 1929 and 1930 Cordoba Grands Prix, the 1931 Argentine Grand Prix, and, in the hands of legendary [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix racing driver]] [[Rudolf Caracciola]], the 1929 British Tourist Trophy race, the 1930 Irish Grand Prix, the 1931 German Grand Prix, and the 1931 [[Mille Miglia]].<ref name="unique">[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/heritage_mercedes_sl.htm "Mercedes SL Heritage"], Unique Cars and Parts</ref><ref name="mm1931">[http://www.ddavid.com/formula1/mille_miglia_1931.htm 1931 Mille Miglia], ddavid.com</ref>
