Riviera Motors was the Beaverton, Oregon based regional distributor of Volkswagens.  Westfalia Campmobiles were selling too quickly for the distributorship to meet demand at the time, so beginning in 1965, Riviera Motors contracted with ASI (Automotive Services, Inc.), based in the Vancouver, Washington area, for Type 2 camper conversions.  

ASI/Riviera campers were converted to Westfalia-styled Campmobiles from panel and passenger vans during the split windscreen era, with conversions predominantly based on passenger van models after the 1968 introduction of the bay window Type 2.  Production continued until sometime in the mid 1980's, with conversions built on the Vanagon (T25) platform after 1979.
