The '''Maybach Exelero''' is a high-performance [[sports car]] designed and built by [[Germany|German]] [[luxury car]] manufacturer [[Maybach]]. It was presented in May 2005 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The 700&nbsp;hp ([[horsepower#hp (SAE)|SAE]]) (514&nbsp;kW) two-seater with a [[bi-turbo]] [[V12 engine]] is a one-off design commissioned by Fulda Tyres. Fulda is using this car as a reference vehicle to test a new generation of wide tires. The German luxury car manufacturer created the one-off model as a modern interpretation of its legendary streamlined sportscar from the 1930s. There are various allusions to the historical predecessor, which was likewise based on a powerful Maybach automobile. In this case, the Maybach SW 38 was also used by Fulda for tire testing.

==Trivia==
American rapper [[Jay-Z]] drove this vehicle in the music video of his song [[Lost One]] and the first to take delivery was noted automobile collector [[André A. Jackson]].
