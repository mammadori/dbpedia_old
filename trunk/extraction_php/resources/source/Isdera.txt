'''Isdera''' is a privately-run [[automaker]] based in a small workshop in [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]]. The company was formerly based in [[Leonberg]], [[Germany]]. Each high-performance [[sports car]] is hand-built by a small team of craftsmen, and the only way to purchase an Isdera is to call the CEO directly. Each vehicle is custom built for its buyer, and a waiting period of six months is to be expected.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1969 by Eberhard Schulz, and its first vehicle, the Isdera Erator GTE, was built in 1970. Some other vehicles in the company's history are the 1983 Spyder 036i, the 1984 Imperator 108i and the 1986 Imperator 033i Spyder. Each model was unveiled at the [[Salon International de l'Auto|Geneva Motor Show]], [[Switzerland]].

In 1993 Isdera designed the [[Commendatore 112i]]. The Commendatore weighed {{convert|1450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, could go 0 to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds, and had a top speed of {{convert|342|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The car had a [[Mid-engine design|mid-mounted]] [[Mercedes-Benz]] 6.0&nbsp;L [[V12 engine]] producing {{Convert|402|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 6-speed [[manual transmission]]. The Commendatore had many advanced and unique features such as two sets of [[gull-wing door]]s, a velocity-sensitive electronic [[chassis]] that lowers the car at high speeds, and an automatic [[Air brake (road vehicle)|air brake]]. The 112i was featured in the video game ''[[Need for Speed II]]''.

An estimated 70 cars have been sold by Isdera since 1983. Projects since 1993 have been kept top secret by Isdera. The companyâ€™s most recent automotive ventures and sales figures have not been released to the general public.

In 1999, Isdera produced a fully functional prototype called the Silver Arrow C112i. The vehicle shared the same body and chassis as the 1993 Commendatore 112i, but was powered by a Mercedes-Benz, {{convert|400|hp|abbr=on}} V12. The car's top speed was recorded at 205 mph (330 km/h). At the time of its introduction, the Silver Arrow was the only car in the world to feature an automatically lifting airbrake.

The Silver Arrow prototype was offered for sale on [[eBay]] in October 2005 for US$3 million, but was not sold. At the time of the auction, the car was located in Switzerland.

In 2006, Isdera introduced the Autobahnkurier AK116i, a controversially-styled vehicle powered by two Mercedes-Benz V8 engines - one for each axle - from the W126-500SE, and reminiscent of a 1930s touring car.
