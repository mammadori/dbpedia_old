The '''Opel Tigra''' is a small coupe produced by [[Opel]] (a subsidiary of [[General Motors Corporation]]) based on its [[Opel Corsa|Corsa]] [[Supermini car|supermini]]. It was originally available as a small [[coupé]], produced from 1994 to 2000, with a new [[roadster]] model introduced in 2004. The Opel Tigra is sold in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as the '''Vauxhall Tigra''', in Australia as the '''Holden Tigra''', and was sold in [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]] as the '''Chevrolet Tigra'''.

==Tigra Mk I (1994-2000)==

[[Image:Tigra 2x2 interior layout .jpg|thumb|200px|left|Tigra's different interior design]]The Tigra was based on the [[concept car]] of the same name and built on the platform of the second generation [[Opel Corsa#Opel_Corsa_B|Opel Corsa B]]. The production vehicle was introduced at the 1993 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], with production starting in early 1994.

The Tigra shared no body panels with the Corsa on which it was based, and the interior layout was different too, with a 2+2 seating arrangement.   Whether because of a wish to save weight or a wish to contain costs, rear seat accommodation was for many purposes vestigial, suitable only for very small people, preferably armed with extra cushions<ref name=CAR200102>{{cite journal| authorlink = Greg Fountain| title = Last stand: Before [the Ford] Puma there was Tigra...| journal = [[Car Magazine]]| volume = | pages = page 210 |date = date February 2001}}</ref>.

The Tigra was available with two [[petrol]] engines options, both from the [[GM Family 1 engine|Ecotec family]], a more affordable 1.4&nbsp;L with 90&nbsp;HP (66&nbsp;kW), and a larger sportier version, powered by the 1.6&nbsp;L engine with 106&nbsp;HP (78&nbsp;kW), sourced from the Corsa GSi and later Corsa Sports. Both were [[DOHC]] [[multivalve|16 valve]] engines with [[electronic fuel injection]]. The smaller engine was available with an optional 4-speed [[automatic gearbox]].

Added to the mass-market underpinnings was a suspension tweaked by [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]. However, the car carried extra weight, with 150&nbsp;kg (330&nbsp;lb) over the equivalent engined Corsa models. Acceleration on the 1.6&nbsp;L model was 10.5 seconds, one second slower than the Corsa GSi. However, a higher top speed of 203&nbsp;km/h (126&nbsp;mph) compensated for its acceleration troubles. This speed increase was obtained thanks to the higher [[gear ratio]]s, a lower [[drag coefficient]] of 0.31, and standard 15" wheels on the more powerful model.

The car was imported by [[Chevrolet]] and sold as the '''Chevrolet Tigra''' in [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]], and as the '''Vauxhall Tigra''' in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Brazilian Chevrolet Tigra was imported only for a few months, between late 1998 to early 1999, due to a sudden depreciation of the [[Brazilian real|real]], which forced [[General Motors do Brasil]] to end importation. Only the 1.6&nbsp;L model was imported, detuned to 99&nbsp;HP (73&nbsp;kW) for tax purposes. The 15" wheels were also exchanged for more affordable 14" wheels.

After an absence of a four years, Opel resurrected the Tigra nameplate in 2004 for a new sports car based on the [[Opel Corsa#Opel_Corsa_C|Opel Corsa C]]. The '''Tigra Twin Top''', as it was called, is a 2-seater [[coupé convertible]] with a retractable hardtop in the fashion of the [[Peugeot 206|Peugeot 206 CC]]. The Tigra is produced by French [[coachbuilder]] [[Heuliez]].

Like its predecessor, the Tigra Twin Top is available with two petrol-powered engines. The base model uses the 1.4&nbsp;L engine with 90&nbsp;HP (66&nbsp;kW), now from the [[GM Family 0 engine|Family 0]], different from the previous generation's 1.4, while the top of the range uses the Ecotec 1.8&nbsp;L from the Corsa GSi, with 125&nbsp;HP (92&nbsp;kW). An economic version, using [[Fiat]]'s [[JTD engine|Multijet]] 1.3 Diesel engine, was introduced in 2005.

The second generation is marketed in [[Australasia]] as the XC-series '''Holden Tigra''', only with the 1.8&nbsp;L engine.

Production of the Tigra Twin Top is still in production today{{-}}
