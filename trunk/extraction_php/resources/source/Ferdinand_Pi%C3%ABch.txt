'''Ferdinand Karl Piëch''' (17 April 1937) is an [[Austrians|Austrian]] automobile engineer and manager.  He is a grandson of [[Ferdinand Porsche]], and son of [[Louise Piëch]] (the sister of [[Ferry Porsche]]).

Piëch was the winner of the award of [[Car Executive of the Century]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title= This Just In: Model T Gets Award|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1DF1439F937A15751C1A96F958260|date=1999-12-24|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Vienna]], Austria, Piëch graduated from the [[ETH Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in 1962, with a degree in mechanical engineering, having written a master thesis about the development of a [[Formula One]] (F1) engine.  At the same time, Porsche was involved in F1 and developed an 8-cylinder for the [[Porsche 804]].

From 1963 to 1971, he worked at [[Porsche]] in [[Stuttgart]], on the development of the [[Porsche 906]] and following models that led to the successful [[Porsche 917]]. In 1972, he moved to [[Audi]] in [[Ingolstadt]], Germany. Starting from 1975, he was manager of technological engineering, being responsible for the concepts of the [[Audi 80]] and [[Audi 100]].  He celebrated his 40th birthday on 17 April 1977 with a ball at which guests included [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and at which the staff of the Porsche Hotel presented him with an Audi 80 that was just 40 cm (16 in) long and constructed of [[marzipan]].<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197709>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ferdinand Simoneit (Ed_| title = Personalien: Ferdinand Piech| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 9 1977| pages = Seite 7 |date = date 27 April 1977}}</ref>    In 1977 he also began the development of a car for the [[World Rally Championship]],  resulting in the [[four-wheel drive]] [[Audi Quattro]].  The engine used in the Quattro model was a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[straight-5|inline-5]]&nbsp;cylinder unit.  

Piëch held a small engineering company in the time between leaving Porsche AG and joining Audi, and while there he developed a 5&nbsp;cylinder in-line [[diesel engine]] for [[Mercedes-Benz]].  He picked up the concept again after moving to Audi, because there was a market demand for engines with more than 4 cylinders. At the time, Audi (and the Audi-derived VW Passat/Santana model range) used logitudinally mounted inline engines and front wheel drive. More conservative layouts with 6 cylinders were abolished because of engineering and production costs (v6-engine) and packaging requirements (straight 6 did not fit because front wheel drive required that it be mounted in front of the axis).

In 1993, Piëch moved to [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen AG)]], where he became [[Chair (official)|Chairman]] and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], succeeding Dr. [[Carl Hahn]].  He retired from the Board of Management in 2002, but as Chairman of the [[Supervisory Board]], he still serves in an advisory capacity.
In 2000, he was named chairman of [[Scania (company)|Scania AB]].<ref>[http://www.scania.com/news/press_releases/2000/q2/press_9741.asp Ferdinand Piëch new chairman of the Scania Board] 24 May 2000, Scania.com</ref>  He retired from the management board in 2002 and succeeded as chairman by [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]]. 

While head of [[Volkswagen Group]], Piëch was known for his aggressive moves into other markets.  He drove the Volkswagen and Audi [[brand]]s upmarket with great success.  Piëch also pursued other [[marque]]s, successfully acquiring [[Lamborghini]] for Audi, and establishing [[Bugatti Automobiles SAS]].  His purchase of British [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Bentley]] was more controversial.  After successfully buying the [[Crewe]], [[England]] carbuilding operation, VW was denied the use of the Rolls-Royce name.  Piëch later claimed that he only really wanted the Bentley brand, but at the time the loss of Rolls to rival [[BMW]] was widely seen as a major failure. 

What was not a failure, however, was his effort to rescue Volkswagen in [[North America]].  Dr. Hahn's previous efforts to regain market share in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] - which he had built up as the head of [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] from 1958 to 1965 - were to no avail, but Piech helped reverse VW's fortunes by agreeing to the manufacture of the [[Volkswagen New Beetle]], the introduction of which in 1998 gave Volkswagen of America a much needed momentum.

==Engineering==
At Porsche, Piëch triggered significant changes in the company's policy.  For example, the position of drivers in [[auto racing|race cars]] was moved from the left to the right, as this gives advantages on the predominantly clockwise race tracks.  After making mainly small 2000&nbsp;[[cubic centimeter|cc]] race cars that were supposed to be closely related to road cars, Porsche made a risky investment by unexpectedly building twenty-five 5000&nbsp;cc [[Porsche 917]], surprising the rule makers at the [[FIA]].  Even [[Ferrari]] had needed to sell his company to [[Fiat]] before making such a move.  Always thinking big, Piëch started development of a 16-cylinder engine for the [[Can-Am]] series.  It is probably no coincidence that his grandfather had developed a famous supercharged 16-cylinder engine for the [[Auto Union]] racing cars in the 1930s.  Piëch was denied the chance to complete it, as a turbocharged version of the existing 12-cylinder was simpler, more powerful and very successful.  Three decades later as CEO of Volkswagen Group, Piëch insisted on the very ambitious [[Bugatti Veyron]], with a turbocharged [[W16 engine|W16]]-cylinder, {{convert|987|hp|kW}} and {{convert|407|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed.  These figures are higher than those of the Porsche 917, and most current racing cars.  Piëch was also behind the [[Volkswagen Phaeton]] luxury saloon, which was intended as a rival to other German luxury cars, but the sales of the model have been disappointing.

==Porsche ownership==
Piëch owns a significant share of [[Porsche]], roughly 13%. In order to prevent discussions among the many family members, a policy was established in early 1972 that no [[Porsche family]] member is allowed to be involved in the management of the company.  Even company founder [[Ferry Porsche]], Piëch's uncle, only held a seat on the supervisory board of Porsche after the company's legal form was changed from a limited partnership to a private legal company.  This made Piëch move to [[Audi]] after the foundation of his engineering bureau.
