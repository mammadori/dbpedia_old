The concept vehicle was based on the second-generation [[Audi TT]] and provided, to some extent, a preview of the new TT, which was yet to be launched. It was powered by a 3.2-litre [[VR6 engine]], developing a maximum output of {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6200 rpm, and torque peaking at {{convert|35.0|kgm|Nm ftlbf|abbr=on}} between 2500 and 3000 rpm.  The engine, already featured in some of the Audi's production models, such as the second generation [[Audi A3]], and the Audi TT sports car, accelerated the Shooting Brake from 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h (62 mph) in 6 seconds, reaching an electronically limited top speed of 250&nbsp;km/h (155 mph).  The vehicle also featured Audi's well-known [[four wheel drive]] system - [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]].

The exterior appearance is dominated by a massive single frame front grille, characteristic to the newest Audi models, as well as clear-glass headlights with the new [[LED]] technology and 19-inch double-spoke wheels originating from [[quattro GmbH]].  The interior puts the emphasis on sporty design and is dominated by materials like aluminium and leather.  A notable interior feature is an evolutionary version of navigation system with [[touch screen]] monitor and character recognition.

In 2007, it became clear that Audi decided not to take the car through to full-scale production.<ref>{{cite web
