The '''Opel Senator''' was a large [[automobile]], two generations of which were sold in [[Europe]] by the [[Germany|German]] [[General Motors]] subsidiary, [[Opel]], from 1978 until 1994. A [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]], its first incarnation was also available with a [[fastback]] [[coupé]] body as the '''Opel Monza''' and '''Vauxhall Royale Coupe'''.

Through the international divisions of General Motors, it was also known in various markets as the '''Chevrolet Senator''', '''Daewoo Imperial''' (in South Korea), '''Vauxhall Royale''' and '''Vauxhall Senator'''.

The original Senator shared its [[automobile platform|platform]] with the smaller [[Opel Rekord]], the latter being lengthened to make the Senator.

The later car, from 1987, shared its base with the [[Opel Omega]], which was again lengthened to produce the Senator.

The '''Senator A''' (the "A" being used for differentiation here, but not a marketed name) was a [[six-light]], lengthened version of the [[Opel Rekord]] E, complemented by a three-door fastback coupé version on the same platform called the Opel Monza, which was planned as a successor for the [[Opel Commodore]] coupé.

===Different market names===
The Senator A and Monza were initially sold in the [[United Kingdom]] as the Vauxhall Royale (and Vauxhall Royale Coupé), because the Opel marque was not so well established, but they were also under their Opel names. The vehicle was also available in [[South Africa]] as the '''Chevrolet Senator''' until 1982, when it was re-badged as an Opel.

===Engines===
The engine range for the first phase of the model's life included the 2.0E, 2.5S (and later the fuel-injected E), the 2.8S and the new developed 3.0E, which had {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|248|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} with fuel injection. The 3-speed [[BorgWarner]] [[automatic transmission]] from the Commodore range needed to be modified to cope with the new and improved power outputs. Opel's own 4-speed [[manual transmission]] was not up to the job and, instead of putting in a more modern 5-speed manual gearbox, Opel turned to transmission producer [[Getrag]], and installed their 264 4-speed manual gearbox in the early Monzas. This was soon replaced with the Getrag 240 for the 2.5 and 2.8 engines, and the Getrag 265 for the 3.0E; both 5-speed manual gearboxes.

The [[straight-six engine]]s were all of the CIH (camshaft in head) same design earlier used in the Commodore models. The CIH configuration is originated from the 1,7 and 1,9 litre straight 4 engines that was first used in the Opel Kadett and Rekord models in 1966, and subsequently was a engine layout that stayed in the Opel cars up until 1993 (the last CIH engine facotory mounted was a 2,4 litre straight 4 CIH used in the Opel Frontera).

With the 3.0 litre engine, the Monza was the fastest car Opel had built up until then, capable of speeds of {{convert|215|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, and 0-100&nbsp;km/h (0-62mph) in 9.5 seconds.

===Mid-life facelift===
The original Senator and Monza were face-lifted in 1982/3. In the UK, the Senator "A2" (as it is sometimes referred to) initially sold only as an Opel, before being re-badged for the UK (as a Vauxhall) in 1984. The A2 Monza was only sold as an Opel.

The facelifted car looked similar to its predecessor, with relatively minor changes: headlights increased in size, and chrome parts were changed to a matt black or colour-coded finish.

Interiors were improved, and engines changed. Now, straight-4 CIH 2.0E and 2.2E engines from the Rekord E2 were available. The 2.5E was given a new [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[fuel injection]] system. The 2.8S was taken out of production, and the 3.0E and a new 3.0H engines were at the top of the range. The 3.0E received upgraded Bosch fuel injection.

===Monza GSE===
[[Image:Opel Monza GSE vl white TCE.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Monza GSE]]
The last incarnation of the Monza was the GSE edition; basically the A2 car, but a high-specification model which had [[Recaro]] sports seats, digital [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] instruments, and an enhanced all-black interior. It also featured a large rear spoiler on the boot. Also GS/E models are equipped with a 40% limited slip differential, a addition that had to be ordered separately on earlier 3,0E cars when purchasing.

By the time the Senator was updated to the new Senator B, and the Monza canceled, 47,008 Monzas had been built. There was no direct Monza replacement, although the idea of a large Opel/Vauxhall sporting car was also seen in the [[Lotus Carlton]] / Lotus Omega saloon. Opel's next coupé was the slightly smaller [[Opel Calibra]].

===Variants===
In the UK, a [[four-wheel drive]] conversion was available, engineered by [[Ferguson Research Ltd.|Ferguson]], who had previously provided similar modifications for the [[Jensen FF]]. These were used by the [[British Armed Forces|British armed forces]] in Germany under the [[BRIXMIS]] (British Commanders'-in-Chief Mission to the Soviet Forces in Germany) operations for the collection of technical intelligence.

A limited edition convertible edition was also available in Germany, where the company "Keinath" reinforced the car heavily, and this added to the all round weight to the car. The Convertible edition is very rare, and are easily recognized by being an all white A2 model, with white or red leather interior.

German tuner and manufacturer Irmscher also made a special "irmscher" version of the Monza, and added small sideskirts and frontspoiler. The most remarkable about these versions where the upgrade of the engine. The 3,0E engine got a reshaped crankshaft and different pistons and rods and the volume was increased to 3,6 liters, and a remapped ECU was added to the Bosch injection system, thus giving the car 206PS, and a large amount of extra tourque. These engines are very popular still, and very hard to find.

===Other uses of the Monza name===
This Monza should not be confused with the South African Opel Monza, which was a saloon version of the smaller [[Opel Kadett]]. To complicate things further, there also was a Chevrolet Monza in [[Brazil]], which was a version of the 1981 German [[Opel Ascona]] but with a three-door fastback body not available anywhere else. There was also an unrelated [[Chevrolet Monza]] in the [[United States]]. In Venezuela, the Opel Senator A was sold as Chevrolet Monza, in sedan, and a hatchback, known as "Monza Hatch".

A new model, the '''Senator B''' (marketed without the "B" suffix), arrived in 1987, a long-wheelbase version of the [[Opel Omega]]. There was no Monza equivalent.

There were various versions of the Senator B: 12-valve 2.5&nbsp;L and 3.0&nbsp;L sized engines were released in 1987 along with a luxury "CD" model with the 3.0&nbsp;L engine. The CD version boasted adjustable suspension, [[air conditioning]], heated seats, [[trip computer]] and [[cruise control]]. The cars were available with either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic gearboxes. Leather seats were also available as an extra-cost option.

A 24-valve 3.0&nbsp;L was introduced in 1989, generating {{convert|204|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} (compared with {{convert|177|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for the older 12-valve version).  This model was very popular with the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|police force]] in the UK, with several cars being supplied to upgraded police specification. The main feature of the new engine was a "Dual Ram" system, increasing torque at low engine speeds by means of a redirected air flow system engaged at 4,000&nbsp;rpm.

Later in the model's lifespan, the 2.5&nbsp;L was replaced by a 2.6&nbsp;L Dual Ram, and the 3.0&nbsp;L 12-valve was deleted in 1992. CD versions of the 2.6&nbsp;L and 24-valve 3.0&nbsp;L were available up to the model's withdrawal in 1994.

When the second-generation Omega was released in 1994, Opel considered that it was sufficiently represented in the upper end of the market by the top-specification Omega Elite. Consequently, the Senator was cancelled after 1994 and not directly replaced.
