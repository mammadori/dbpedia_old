The '''Volkswagen Touareg''' is a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[luxury car|luxury]] [[sport utility vehicle]] produced by German [[automotive industry|automaker]] [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Passenger Cars]] since 2002.  It was the third sport utility vehicle from the automaker, after the much older [[Volkswagen 181|Volkswagen 181 "Kurierwagen"]], and the [[Volkswagen Iltis|Iltis]] (later produced by [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]]).

==Pronunciation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
The correct German pronunciation is Tou-a-reg, something like "too" plus a quick "ah" then the "reg".{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  Volkswagen produced several commercials to enable people to pronounce the name, which was predicted to be too difficult.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  The name was evidently borrowed from the [[Tuareg]] people, a [[Berber people|Berber]]-speaking group in [[North Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Development==
{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2009}}
The Touareg (internally designated ''Typ 7L'') was a [[joint venture]] project developed by [[Volkswagen Group]], who also include [[Audi]], and [[Porsche]], who were also looking to add a luxury-type SUV to its lineup, as a cost-sharing initiative.  The goal was to create an [[off-road vehicle]] that could handle like a sports car.  The team, with over 300 people, was led by [[Klaus-Gerhard Wolpert]], and was based in [[Weissach im Tal]], Germany.  The result of the joint project is that the [[Porsche Cayenne]] shares the Touareg's [[Volkswagen Group PL71 platform]], although there are styling, equipment, and technical differences between the two vehicles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The Volkswagen Touareg is built in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].  The manufacturing plant shares production with Touareg-cousins, the [[Porsche Cayenne]], and the [[Audi Q7]].  Due to the demand, and the exchange rates of [[euro]]s against the [[United States dollar|US dollar]], as well as different pricing and environmental policies in the USA, the [[V6 engine|V6]] and [[V8 engine]] variants make up most of Volkswagen's American Touareg offering.  However, a limited number of the [[V10 engine|V10]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]]s were available in the 2004 model year (before being pulled for environmental reasons).  They were brought back to the United States for the 2006 as a "Tier I emissions concept (43 state emissions)".<ref name="completespecs1">{{cite web|title=Touareg - Complete Specs (USA)|url=http://www.vw.com/touareg/completespecs/en/us/#/show_all|publisher=VW.com|date= |accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref>

==Feature highlights==
{{Refimprovesect|date=March 2009}}
The Touareg comes standard with [[four-wheel drive]] system.  An automatic progressively locking centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] (with manual override), and a "low range" setting that can be activated with in-cabin controls.  Options to make the vehicles more capable off-road include an available air [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system which can raise the car's [[ride height]] on command, and an interior switch allowing the rear differential to be manually locked.  Its load level ground clereance is at 6.3&nbsp;[[inch]]es, Off Road Level is at 9.6&nbsp;inches, and Xtra clearance of 11.8&nbsp;inches.<ref name="completespecs1"/>

The 5.0&nbsp;[[litre]] [[overhead camshaft#single overhead camshaft|single overhead camshaft]] (SOHC), 20-valve [[V10 engine|V10]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]] pushes the Touareg from standstill to {{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in 7.8&nbsp;[[second]]s, and on to {{convert|230|km/h}} maximum.

The 6.0 [[liter]] [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshaft]] (DOHC), 48-valve [[W12 engine]]d version was initially intended to be a limited-edition model, with just 500 units planned to be produced; around 330 were slated for sale in [[Saudi Arabia]], with the remainder sold in Europe.  No sales in the United States were made.  Eventually, the W12 model became an ordinary model without any production restrictions.  Currently it is being sold in Europe.  It is estimated to reach {{convert|100|km/h|1}} in 5.9 seconds.<ref>[http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041004/FREE/410040711&SearchID=7329098035109 "Super Touareg", ''Autoweek'', 4 October, 2004]. Retrieved on [[2008-05-27]]</ref>

====V10 TDI (2002-)====
The V10 TDI was offered in the United States for a limited time in 2004, but emissions regulations forced it off the market for a temporary period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Auto Tech: Pumpe Duse|url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/jk/040929.htm|work=CanadianDriver Communications Inc.,|publisher=CanadianDriver.com|date=29 September 2004|accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref>

The V10 TDI returned to the U.S. market as 2006 model year vehicle in 5 states. Later US models went on sale in 2006, which was compliant with 50 states emission with Ultra-low sulfur diesel and particulate filter. The 2006 US model's MSRP was $67,750.<ref>[http://green.autoblog.com/2006/10/19/vw-touareg-diesel-now-on-sale-with-a-particulate-filter/ 2006 VW Touareg diesel now on sale with a particulate filter]</ref>  Stricter CARB emissions standards resulted in the V10 TDI being cancelled again in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid|first=Sam|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/10/27/in-the-autoblog-garage-2008-volkswagen-touareg-v10-tdi|title=In the Autoblog Garage: 2008 Volkswagen Touareg V10 TDI|publisher=Autoblog.com|date=2008-10-27 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>  This has since been replaced by a V6 TDI engine that meets the [[California Air Resources Board]]'s (CARB's) minimum emission requirements for the 2009 model year.

=====V10 TDI environmental and health concerns=====
The V10 TDI diesel version of the Touareg was named "Meanest Vehicles for the Environment in 2007" by the [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE)]]<ref>[http://www.greenercars.org/highlights_meanest.htm The Green Book of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy 2007]</ref> for its fuel economy of 17 miles per US gallon city (14&nbsp;l/100&nbsp;km) and 22&nbsp;mpg highway (10&nbsp;l/100&nbsp;km).  Note that diesel vehicles are judged at a disadvantage - to illustrate, an average [[North America]]n full-size (gasoline(petrol)-not diesel) SUV usually travels 13&nbsp;mpg (US) (18&nbsp;l/100&nbsp;km) city and 16&nbsp;mpg (US) (15&nbsp;l/100&nbsp;km) highway.  This earned the Touareg the low "Green Score" of 14, as compared to the [[Honda Civic GX]], which was the "greenest", at a score of 57.

===Awards===
The Touareg was ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Best Luxury SUV]] for 2003, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Sport/Utility of the Year]] for 2004, "Four Wheeler" magazine's Four Wheeler of the Year for 2005, and Overlander's 2003 4WDOTY.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Facelift 2007==
[[Image:Volkswagen Touareg -- 07-09-2009.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Volkswagen Touareg 2 (US)]]
The Touareg's first [[facelift (automobile)|facelift]] was unveiled at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile 2006|2006 Paris Motor Show]], and debuted in [[North America]] as a 2008 model.  It now features the shield [[grille]] from others in the [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Passenger Cars]] range.  The updated Touareg has more than 2300 redesigned parts and boasts some new technological features:
*ABS Plus, which works in conjunction with the [[traction control system]], and shortens the [[braking distance]] by up to 25% on loose surfaces;
*Front Scan, an [[adaptive cruise control]] system, which can slow or even stop the car depending on traffic conditions;
*Side Scan, a [[blind spot (automobile)|blind-spot]] warning system: it uses radar at the rear of the car to sense another car's presence, and causes [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) built into the [[wing mirror]]s to flash.  If the driver indicates to move out, the LEDs flash at an accelerated rate to warn the driver until the other vehicle moves out of the Touareg's field of vision.

The 2007 Touareg, alongside an already lengthy options list, could be equipped with a driving dynamics package, a [[rollover]] sensor, a 620&nbsp;watt Dynaudio sound system, and redesigned comfort seats.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  All diesel versions now have the [[diesel particulate filter]] standard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In the US and Canada, the facelifted Touareg is marketed as the Touareg 2.

===Production===
The chassis of Volkswagen-Red Bull Baja Race Touareg TDI was produced by Arciero Miller Racing in [[Foothill Ranch, California]].

Although Volkswagen originally had planned to introduce a range of hybrid models including in its entry level vehicles, the company stopped the plan for low end hybrids after the company's CEO had been changed to [[Martin Winterkorn]]. However, the change of plan did not affect Touareg hybrid, because Touareg luxury SUV can more easily absorb the additional cost and is a better candidate for improved fuel economy.<ref>[http://green.autoblog.com/2007/02/01/volkswagen-ditches-low-end-hybrids-touareg-gets-the-nod/ Volkswagen ditches low end hybrids, Touareg gets the nod]</ref>
