The E25 '''BMW Turbo''' prototype was built as a celebration for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich.

For this occasion, renowned designer [[Paul Bracq]] created an innovative design for a [[BMW]] automobile, the BMW Turbo. Only two were ever built. Today, it is one of the rarest BMWs, with its elegant design, [[gull-wing door|gullwing doors]] and futuristic cockpit. BMW later used the Turbo's design themes on the [[BMW M1|M1]], the [[BMW 8-Series|8-Series]], the [[BMW Z1|Z1]] and the 2008 M1 Homage Concept.
