{{TOC right}}The '''Volkswagen Transporter''' series, also referred to as the '''Volkswagen Group T platform''' series, refers to several generations of [[motor vehicle]]s from [[Volkswagen Group]].  These are traditionally in the [[light commercial vehicle]] sector, and comprise [[van]]s, [[pickup truck|pick-ups]], [[campervan]]s, and other derived vehicles, spanning over 55 years of production.  Throughout their generations, they have generally been avaialble worldwide.

Though the T1 to T3 generations were named unofficially and retrospectively, the T series is now considered an official [[list of Volkswagen Group platforms|Volkswagen Group automotive platform]].{{-}}

==T1==

{{main|Volkswagen Type 2#T1}}
1950-1967 — Initially derived from the Type 1 [[Volkswagen Beetle]], the T1 was the first generation of Volkswagen's hugely successful Transporter family.  Known informally to enthusiasts as "split screens" or "splitties".{{-}}

{{main|Volkswagen Type 2#T2}}
1968-present — The T2 platform is basically a cosmetically upgraded T1 (since only one vehicle shares the platform at this point, the distinction is used for both the Type 2 generation and platform), with a [[Volkswagen Type 4]] engine optionally available from 1972 on.  This generation was informally known as "bay" (derrived from [[bay window]]) or "bread loaf".

===Flexible-fuel===
{{As of|2009}}, a modern T2 with a [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flexible-fuel engine]] that runs on any combination of [[gasoline]] and [[ethanol (fuel)|ethanol]] is still manufactured in [[Brazil]] as the Volkswagen Kombi Total Flex.{{-}}

==T3==

{{main|Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)}}
1980-1991 — Also known as the T25, (or Vanagon in the [[United States]]), the T3 platform was introduced in 1980, and was one of the last new Volkswagen platforms to use an [[air-cooled engine]].  The [[Volkswagen air cooled engine]] was phased out for a [[water cooling|water-cooled]] [[flat engine|boxer engine]] (still [[rear-engine design|rear mounted]]) in 1984.{{-}}

==T4==

1990-2003 — The first officially designated "T platform" vehicle, the T4 dramatically updated the Volkswagen van line by using a [[front-engine design|front-mounted]], [[front-wheel drive]], water-cooled engine.{{-}}

==T5==
{{main|Volkswagen Transporter (T5)}}

2003-present — The T5 is the current variant of the Volkswagen Transporter.  In [[North America]] it is sold only in Mexico but not in the United States or Canada.

The T5 range received a [[facelift (automobile)|facelift]] in late 2009.  Updated [[powertrain]] options include [[common rail]] diesel engines, and a world-first useage in a light commercial vehicle of a [[dual clutch transmission]] - namely Volkswagen Group's 7-speed [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]].{{-}}
