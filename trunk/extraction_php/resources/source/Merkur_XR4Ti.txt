The '''[[Merkur]] XR4Ti''' was a short-lived [[United States]] and [[Canada]]-market version of the [[Europe]]an [[Ford Sierra|Ford Sierra XR4i]]. It was the brainchild of then Ford Vice President [[Robert Lutz|Bob Lutz]]. It was sold in the US from 1985 to 1989. It was the first vehicle of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford's]] Merkur range, followed in 1988 by the [[Merkur Scorpio]]. Ford had hopes of importing its top European models under this brand, including the [[Ford Sierra|Sierra Sapphire]] but the venture was ultimately unsuccessful due to branding issues, increasing [[Deutsche Mark]] exchange rates, general poor marketing tactics and the introduction in 1990 of new safety requirements such as [[airbags]] that would have increased retooling and production costs.

==History==

The cars were hand assembled and built entirely by [[Karmann]] Coachwerks in [[Rheine]], [[Germany]].

The XR4Ti was distinguished mechanically by its [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Ford Pinto engine#2.3 OHC|Ford Lima]] 2.3 L [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] SOHC engine and independent rear suspension, and stylistically by its large bi-plane spoiler (replaced in later years with a single rear spoiler). It came with either the [[Ford C3 transmission|C3]] 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] or the Ford [[Type 9]], 5-speed [[manual transmission]].  Many felt it resembled the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] RS at the time, although the two were built on different platforms. Mechanically, it differed from the European [[Ford Sierra#XR4i and other sporting models|Ford Sierra XR4i]], which had a 2.8l Ford Cologne [[V6]].

The XR4Ti was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'s'' [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1985. In 2009 however, ''Car and Driver'' staff apologized for including the XR4Ti in their 1985 "Ten Best" list, and effectively recanted the award, citing that in hindsight it did not meet the criteria.[http://autos.yahoo.com/articles/autos_content_landing_pages/846/dishonorable-mention-the-10-most-embarrassing-award-winners-in-automotive-history/]

It has been suggested that Ford had planned to import [[South America]]n-made Sierras to supplement its range before the cancellation of the Merkur brand in 1989, but this was not realized, nor the proposed plan actually confirmed.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Many attribute airbag legislation for the 1990 model years and weak sales as the cause for the Merkur range to be discontinued.

The XR4Ti sold for approx. US$18,750.00 and the Scorpio for just a little over US$27,250.00


In 2009 Car and Driver declared it one of the worst cars it had ever named "Best" owning to its peculiarity and low  consumer appeal.<ref>http://autos.yahoo.com/articles/autos_content_landing_pages/846/dishonorable-mention-the-10-most-embarrassing-award-winners-in-automotive-history Car and Driver's dishonerable mention</ref>

==Engines==

The XR4Ti came with one engine, the 2.3 liter turbocharged, in-line, fuel injected 'Lima' four cylinder using an EEC-IV computer. The 4-cylinder engine was generally rated at {{Convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} when mated with an automatic transmission (8 to 10 [[lbf/inÂ²]] [55 to 70 [[kPa]]] boost), and {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} when matched with the 5-speed manual transmission (12 to {{convert|14|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. boost). This engine weighs a surprising {{convert|450|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} in full (turbo) trim. This engine is basically the same as that found in the SVO Mustang and the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe of the time, though the SVO Mustang and Thunderbird Turbo Coupe differed by having an intercooler and better EECIV programming.

==Options==

The XR4Ti options included heated seats, leather seats, power windows, power door locks and a moonroof (retractable, tinted glass), with heated power mirrors coming equipped as a standard item. Some were sold with crank windows (very few, in actuality) and a solid roof but most came with everything but the leather seats.

==Performance==

The top speed of the manual transmission XR4Ti 1985-87 was {{convert|140|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.  The bi-plane rear spoiler was changed to a single spoiler for the 1988-1989 cars; it actually increased the drag coefficient compared to the bi-plane spoiler of the earlier cars. 

[[Car & Driver]] tests for the XR4Ti reported 0-60 mph times from 7 seconds flat  and as high 7.9 seconds and 1/4 mile times at around 15.7 seconds.  Later tests by Car & Driver showed 7.8 seconds for the 0-60mph times and they mentioned the press car might have been a ringer which was common at the time.  In their test data, they initially stated the car came with a limited slip differential which was a misprint, at the time there were no LSD's available in either the American Merkur XR4Ti or its sister car the Europe-only XR4i.   It wasn't until the introduction of the European only XR4x4 and Cosworth Sierra that a LSD was offered from the factory.

==Motorsport==

Despite the XR4Ti never being sold outside the United States and Canada, in 1985, [[Andy Rouse]] used one to compete in the [[British Touring Car Championship|British Saloon Car Championship]].  He took the overall title for that year and the class title for the following year with 14 race victories altogether.<ref>[http://www.btccpages.com/driv/rouseandy.php BTCC Pages - Drivers - Andy Rouse<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Eggenberger Motorsport]] was among the few to use an XR4Ti to compete in the [[European Touring Car Championship|ETCC]] and the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft|DTM]] (German Touring Car Championship) with positive results. Ford would use the car's technical feedback from the teams to develop the super car version of the Sierra in 1986, the [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth|Sierra Cosworth]], shortly superseded by the RS500. Some of the body panels used to stiffen the Sierra chassis and create the Merkur shell were subsequently branded 909 Motorsport parts for later adaptation to a Sierra shell. Many see the successes and failures of the XR4Ti as being the blueprint for success of the dominant [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth|Sierra Cosworth]].

Between 1986 and 1987, [[Wally Dallenbach, Jr.]] and [[Scott Pruett]] campaigned the Roush prepped XR4Ti, although of a [[tubeframe]] construction like that of a [[NASCAR]] racer, to take the [[Trans-Am Series]] title.
