The '''Volkswagen Type 2''' (also known as '''Transporter''' or '''Bus''') was the second automotive line introduced by [[Germany|German]] automaker [[Volkswagen]].  It was a [[van]] introduced in 1950, initially based on Volkswagen's first model, the Type 1, also known as the "[[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]".  The Type 2 is the forerunner of modern cargo and passenger vans.  The Type 2 spawned a number of imitators, both in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], including the [[Ford Econoline]], [[Dodge A100]], and the [[Chevrolet Corvan|Corvair 95 Corvan]], the last even adopting the Type 2's rear-engine configuration.  {{As of|2009}}, updated versions of this line are produced for international markets, both as a passenger and cargo van, and as a [[pickup truck]].  It is also unofficially known as a "microbus", a "minibus"<ref>[http://www.projo.com/lifebeat/content/Mark28_07-28-09_T9F6IMQ_v12.27857d7.html Patinkin, Mark/ "1969 was the most tumultuous and normal year"], ''[[Providence Journal]]'', July 28, 2009</ref> or "hippie van," the latter due to its popularity with the 1960s/70s counter-culture movement.

In the [[Disney Pixar]] movie ''[[Cars (Disney)|Cars]]'', the character Fillmore, voiced by the late [[George Carlin]], is portrayed as an anti-establishment hippie-type, and is a psychedelically-painted Volkswagen Microbus.  In 2009, Volkswagen itself used a microbus, with the same demeanor, in its advertising.  The Microbus from the television commercials is voiced by [[Thomas Haden Church]].{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==History==
[[Image:VWcampervan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A "Camper" at [[The Henry Ford]].]]
The idea for the Type 2 is credited to [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Volkswagen importer [[Ben Pon (senior)|Ben Pon]], who drew the first sketches of the van in 1947. Although the [[aerodynamics]] of the first prototypes were poor, heavy optimisation took place at the [[wind tunnel]] of the Technical University of [[Braunschweig]].  The wind tunnel work paid off, as the Type 2 was aerodynamically superior to the Beetle, despite its slab-sided shape.  Three years later, under the direction of Volkswagen's new [[CEO]] [[Heinz Nordhoff]], the first production model left the [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|factory]] at [[Wolfsburg]].  It has similarities in concept to the 1920s [[Rumpler Tropfenwagen]], and 1930s [[Dymaxion car]] by [[Buckminster Fuller]], neither of which reached production.

Unlike other rear-engine Volkswagens, which evolved constantly over time but never saw the introduction of all-new models, the Transporter not only evolved, but was completely revised periodically with variations referred to as versions "T1" to "T5," although only generations T1 to T3 (or T25 as it is called in Ireland and Great Britain) can be seen as directly related to the Beetle (see below for details).
[[Image:Be Your Own Goddess art bus (1967 VW Kombi) IMG 0136.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Custom painted ''art bus'']]
The Type 2, along with the 1947 [[Citroën H Van]], among the first 'forward control' vans in which the driver was placed above the front wheels.  It started a trend in Europe, where the 1952 GM [[Bedford CA]], 1960 BMC [[Morris J4]], and 1960 [[Commer]] FC copied the concept.  In the United States, the [[Corvair]]-based Chevrolet Corvan cargo van and Greenbrier passenger van went so far as to copy the Type 2's rear-engine layout, using the Corvair's horizontally-opposed, air-cooled engine for power.  Except for the Greenbrier and various 1950s-70s [[Fiat]] minivans, the Type 2 remained unique in being rear-engined.  This was a disadvantage for the early "barndoor" Panel Vans, which couldn't easily be loaded from the rear due to the engine cover intruding on interior space, but generally advantageous in traction and interior noise.

===In counterculture===

During the [[hippie]] era in the United States, the Bus became a major [[counterculture]] symbol.  There were several reasons: The van could carry a number of people plus camping gear and cooking supplies, extra clothing, [[do-it-yourself]] carpenter's tools, etc.  As a "statement" its boxy, utilitarian shape made the Type 2 everything the American cars of the day were not.  Used models were inexpensive — many were hand-painted (a predecessor of the modern-day [[art car]]).  Some Bus enthusiasts, especially for antiwar activists, would replace the VW logo with a painted [[peace symbol]] up front.  Since that time the original 1950–1967 Type 2 (especially the pre-1956, nicknamed barndoors) has become a [[collector's item]].

==Variants==
[[Image:Samba(1).jpg|thumb|right|250px|VW Samba bus]]
The Type 2 was available as a:
*[[Panel van]], a delivery van without side windows or rear seats.
*Walk-Through Panel Van, a delivery van without side windows or rear seats and cargo doors on both sides.
*High Roof Panel Van ({{lang-de|Hochdach}}), a delivery van with raised roof.
*Kombi, from {{lang-de|Kombinationskraftwagen}} (combination motor vehicle), with side windows and removable rear seats, both a passenger and a cargo vehicle combined.
*Bus, also called a ''[[Volkswagen Caravelle]]'', a van with more comfortable interior reminiscent of passenger cars since the third generation.
*[[Samba (bus)|Samba-Bus]], a van with skylight windows and cloth sunroof, first generation only, also known as a ''Deluxe Microbus''.
*Flatbed [[pickup truck]], or Single Cab, also available with wider load bed.
*[[Crew cab]] pick-up, a flatbed truck with extended cab and two rows of seats, also called a '''Doka''', from {{lang-de|Doppelkabine}}.
*[[Volkswagen Westfalia Campers|Westfalia camping van]], "Westy", with [[Westfalia]] roof and interior.
*Semi-camping van that can also still be used as a passenger car and transporter, sacrificing some camping comforts. "Multivan" or "Weekender", available from the third generation on.

Apart from these factory variants, there were a multitude of third-party conversions available, some of which were offered through Volkswagen dealers.  They included, but were not limited to, refrigerated vans, [[hearse]]s, [[ambulance]]s, police vans, [[fire apparatus|fire engines]] and ladder trucks, and camping van conversions by companies other than Westfalia.

The first generation of the Volkswagen Type 2 with the split [[windshield]], called the '''Microbus''', '''Splitscreen''', or '''Splittie''' among modern fans, was produced from 8 March 1950 through the end of the 1967 model year.  From 1950 to 1956, the T1 was built in [[Wolfsburg]]; from 1956 it was built at the completely new Transporter factory in [[Hanover]].  Like the Beetle, the first Transporters used the [[Volkswagen air cooled engine]], an {{convert|1131|cc|1|lk=on}}, {{convert|19|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}, [[air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] [[flat-4|four-cylinder]] [[boxer engine]] mounted in the rear.  This was upgraded to an {{convert|1192|cc|1}} (1.2L) {{convert|30|bhp|kW PS|0}} (36hp SAE) in 1953.  A higher compression ratio became standard in 1955; while an unusual early version of the 34&nbsp;bhp (40hp SAE) (30&nbsp;kW) engine debuted exclusively on the Type 2 in 1959. This engine proved to be so uncharacteristically troublesome that Volkswagen recalled all 1959 Transporters and replaced the engines with an updated version of the 34&nbsp;bhp (40hp SAE) (30&nbsp;kW) engine. Any 1959 models that retain that early engine today are true survivors. Since the engine was totally discontinued at the outset, no parts were ever made available.

The early versions of the T1 until 1955 were often called the '''T1a''' or "Barndoor", owing to the enormous rear engine cover, while the later versions with a slightly modified body (the roofline above the windshield is extended), smaller engine bay, and 15 in (381&nbsp;mm) wheels instead of the original 16 in (406&nbsp;mm) ones were called the '''T1b'''. From the 1964 model year, when the rear door was made wider (same as on the T2), the vehicle was referred to as the '''T1c'''. 1964 also saw the introduction of an optional sliding door for the passenger/cargo area instead of the outwardly hinged doors typical of cargo vans.  This change arguably makes the 1964 VW the first true [[minivan]], although the term wouldn't be coined for another two decades.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

In 1962, a heavy-duty Transporter was introduced as a factory option. It featured a cargo capacity of one metric ton (1,000&nbsp;kg) instead of the previous {{convert|750|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, smaller but wider 14 in (356&nbsp;mm) wheels, and a 1.5 L, 42 DIN&nbsp;hp (31&nbsp;kW) engine. This was so successful that only a year later, the 750&nbsp;kg, 1.2&nbsp;L Transporter was discontinued. The 1963 model year introduced the 1493 cc (1.5L or "1500") engine as standard equipment to the US market at 51hp (38&nbsp;kW) with an {{convert|83|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore, {{convert|69|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke, and 7.8 to 1 compression ratio. When the Beetle received the 1.5&nbsp;L engine for the 1967 model year, its power was increased to 53 hp DIN (40&nbsp;kW).
The Volkswagen Kombis engine has been noted to be very reliable and to also last a very long time.

German production stopped after the 1967 model year; however, the T1 still was made in [[Brazil]] until 1975, when it was modified with a 1968-79 T2-style front end and big 1972-vintage taillights into the so-called "T1.5" and produced until 1996. The Brazilian T1s were not identical to the last German models (the T1.5 was locally produced in Brazil using the 1950s and 1960s-era stamping dies to cut down on retooling, alongside the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]/Fusca, where the pre-1965 body style was retained), though they sported some characteristic features of the T1a, such as the cargo doors and 5-stud (205&nbsp;mm bolt circle) rims. Brazil production air-cooled vehicles (including the [[Volkswagen Brasilia|VW Brasilia]]) are a rare find in the USA and usually sought after by collectors.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Among American enthusiasts, it is common to refer to the different models by the number of their windows. The basic Kombi or Bus is the '''11-window''' (a.k.a. 3-window bus because of three side windows) with a split windshield, two front cabin door windows, six rear side windows, and one rear window. The deluxe model featured eight rear side windows and two rear corner windows, making it the '''15-window''' (not available in Europe). Meanwhile, the sunroof deluxe with its additional eight small skylight windows is, accordingly, the '''23-window'''. From the 1964 model year, with its wider rear door, the rear corner windows were discontinued, making the latter two the '''13-window''' and '''21-window''' respectively.  The 23 and later 21 window variants are usually described as [[Samba (bus)|Sambas]].

====The T1 and the Chicken Tax====

The Volkswagen T1 played a role in a historic episode during the early 1960s, known as the '''Chicken War.''' [[France]] and [[West Germany]] had placed tariffs on imports of U.S. chicken.<ref name="wsjtransit">{{cite web

In retrospect, audio tapes from the Johnson White House, revealed a [[quid pro quo]] unrelated to chicken. In January 1964, President Johnson attempted to convince [[United Auto Workers]]'s president [[Walter Reuther]] not to initiate a strike just prior the 1964 election and to support the president's civil rights platform. Reuther in turn wanted Johnson to respond to [[Volkswagen]]'s increased shipments to the United States.<ref name="nyt1"/>

In 1968, the second generation of the Type 2 was introduced. It was built in Germany until 1979. In Mexico, the Volkswagen Combi and Panel were produced from 1970 to 1994. The Brazilian VW plant has produced the Kombi since the 50s until today. Models before 1971 are often called the '''T2a''' (or "Early Bay"), while models after 1972 are called the '''T2b''' (or "Late Bay").

This second-generation Type 2 lost its distinctive split front [[windshield]], and was slightly larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor. Its common nicknames are '''Breadloaf''' and '''Bay-window''', or '''Loaf''' and '''Bay''' for short.<ref>[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1084792 "Type II Volkswagen (thing)", section "Type 2/T2"] (Spells the term "Bread-Loaf")</ref> At 1.6&nbsp;L and 48 DIN&nbsp;hp (35&nbsp;kW), the engine was also slightly larger. The new model also did away with the [[swing axle]] rear suspension and transfer boxes previously used to raise ride height. Instead, [[half-shaft]] axles fitted with [[constant velocity joint|CV joint]]s raised ride height without the wild changes in [[Camber angle|camber]] of the Beetle-based swing axle suspension. The updated Bus transaxle is usually sought after by off-road racers using air-cooled VW components.

The T2b was introduced by way of gradual change over three years. The first models had unique body features, such as curvaceous bumpers with the front bumper wrapping around to form the step when the door was opened (replaced by shapeless stand-off bumpers on later models), front doors that opened right out to 90 degrees from the body, no lip on the front guards, and crescent air intakes in the D pillars (later models have squared off intakes). They also had unique engine hatches, and up until 1972 front indicators set low on the nose rather than high on either side of the fresh air grille - thus giving rise to their nickname as "Low Lights". The 1971 Type 2 featured a new, 1.6&nbsp;L engine with dual intake ports on each cylinder head and was rated at 50 DIN&nbsp;hp (37&nbsp;kW). An important change came with the introduction of front [[disc brake]]s and new wheels with brake ventilation holes and flatter hubcaps. 1972's most prominent change was a bigger engine compartment to fit the larger 1.7 to 2.0&nbsp;L engines from the [[VW Type 4]], and a redesigned rear end which eliminated the removable rear apron. The air inlets were also enlarged to accommodate the increased cooling air needs of the larger engines.

This all-new, larger engine is commonly called the '''Type 4 engine''' as opposed to the previous '''Type 1 engine''' first introduced in the Type 1 Beetle.  This engine was called "Type 4" because it was originally designed for the Type 4 (411 and 412) automobiles.  They used the "Type 1" engine from the Beetle with minor modifications such as rear mount provisions and different cooling shroud arrangements. The "Type 3'' so called ''pancake" 1500 and later 1600 cc engines used in Type 3 notchback, fastback and squareback cars, plus the Type 34 Karmann Ghia, were never used in Type 2 vans or buses. The pancake nickname came from its low overall height due to mounting the cooling fan on the end of the crankshaft, a technique later employed for the Type 4 engines. European vans stuck with the upright fan Type 1 1600 engine even after the Type 4 motor became standard for US Type 2 export models.

In the Type 2, the [[VW Type 4]] engine was an option for the 1972 model year onward. This engine was standard in models destined for the US and Canada. Only with the Type 4 engine did an [[automatic transmission]] become available for the first time in the 1973 model year. Both engines displaced 1.7 L, rated at 66 DIN&nbsp;hp (49&nbsp;kW) with the [[manual transmission]] and 62 DIN&nbsp;hp (46&nbsp;kW) with the automatic. The Type 4 engine was enlarged to 1.8&nbsp;L and 68 DIN&nbsp;hp (50&nbsp;kW) for the 1974 model year and again to 2.0&nbsp;L and 70 DIN&nbsp;hp (52&nbsp;kW) for the 1976 model year. The 1978 2.0 L now featured hydraulic lifters, eliminating the need to periodically adjust the valves as on earlier models. The 1975 and later U.S. model years received Bosch L-Jetronic electronic fuel injection as standard equipment; 1978 was the first year for electronic ignition, utilizing a hall effect sensor and digital controller, eliminating maintenance-requiring breaker points. As with all Transporter engines, the focus in development was not on power, but on low-end [[torque]].  The Type 4 engines were considerably more robust and durable than the Type 1 engines, particularly in transporter service.

The year 1973 also saw the most noticeable exterior changes. The front turn indicators were squared off from the previous version and set higher in the front valance, above the headlights.  This model year also brought new square-profiled bumpers, which became standard until the end of the T2 in 1979. Crash safety improved greatly with this change due to a compressible structure behind the front bumper. This meant that the T2b was capable of meeting US safety standards for passenger cars of the time, though being vans they were not required to. The only thing that shrunk on the new model, or so it seemed, was the large and distinctive "VW" emblem on the front of the early model.

Later model changes were primarily under the skin. By 1974, the T2 had gained its final shape. Very late in the T2's design life, during the late 1970s, the first prototypes of Type 2 vans with [[four wheel drive]] were built and tested.

====T2 Hot Wheels====
The T2 also has the distinction of being the basis for one of the most sought-after and valuable toys in US history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In 1969, [[Mattel]] introduced a new model to their line of [[Hot Wheels]] die-cast toy cars. This was the "Beach Bomb," a customized Type 2 complete with [[surfboard]]s. The prototypes had the surfboards placed in the car, sticking out from the rear window. These "Rear Loaders" turned out to have an excessively high center of gravity, making them prone to tip over in banked curves, so the Beach Bomb was completely redesigned. The production model had its body sectioned to reduce height, a counter weight added to its base, and the surfboards were placed inside widened rear fenders to create a lower center of gravity, resulting in the nickname "Side Loader".
Only a few dozen of the prototype "Rear Loaders" have survived, with only two of them painted in "Spectraflame Hot Pink". One of these Hot Pink Rearloaders was sold privately in 2000 for $72,000 while the other sold in 2004 for over $50,000.

===T2c===

The '''T2c''', so called since it got a slightly raised roof — by about 10&nbsp;cm — in the early 1990s, was built for the [[South America]]n and [[Central America]]n markets. In Brazil it is known as "Kombi".

Since 1995, the T2c has been built in [[Brazil]] with 1.6L air-cooled engines for the Brazilian market and with the water-cooled 1.8 L 4 cyl. inline 90 bhp fuel injected engine for the Mexican market, the latter easily identified by their large, black-coloured, front-mounted radiators.
Since production of the original Beetle was halted in late 2003 as a 2004 model, the T2 remained the only Volkswagen model with the traditional air-cooled, rear-mounted boxer engine when the Brazilian model shifted to water-cooled on December 23, 2005. There was a 1.6 L 50hp water-cooled Diesel version of the T2, which was manufactured from 1981 to 1985 in Brazil. This version suffered from low torque and cooling problems which led to short engine life. Most of them have already disappeared or converted to VW gasoline 1.6 or 1.8 L units, from the so called "AP" family.

The end of the VW air-cooled engine on a Worldwide basis was marked by a Special Edition Kombi. An exclusive Silver paint job and limited edition emblems were applied to only 200 units in late 2005, and were sold as 2006 model-year.

The shift to water-cooled engines is in response to Brazil's emission laws which went into effect from 2006. The new water-cooled engine will [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|run on petrol as well as alcohol]], which costs about 50% less than ordinary fuel in Brazil. Borrowed from the [[VW Fox]], the engine is an EA-111 1.4 8v Total Flex. 1390 cc, {{convert|78|hp|abbr=on}} on petrol, and {{convert|80|hp|abbr=on}} when run on [[ethanol]], and 124 Nm (91 lb.ft) torque. This version has been very successful, despite the minor changes made to the overall vehicle. It still boasts the 4-speed transmission, but with a new differential ratio it can cruise at 120 kph at 4,100 rpm. Top speed is 130 kph. 0-100 kph (0-60 mph) is achieved in 22.7 sec (vs. 29,5 sec for the latest air cooled version). All that comes with an average 6.6% better fuel economy, and nearly 2[[dB]] less noise (again vs. the air cooled version).

The VW T2 is by far the longest model run in Brazil, having been introduced in September 1950. The fierce competition from European [[FWD]] newer generation vans still cannot match the VW "Kombi" unparalleled cost-benefit equation. Only produced in 2 versions, bus (9-seater or 12-seater - a fourth row is added for metro transportation or school bus market) or panel van, it offers only one factory option: the rear window defog. As of June 2009, the T2 is built at the VW's [[São Bernardo do Campo]] plant at a rate of 97 jobs per day.

Specialists say the VW T2 will come to an end in Brazil by 2012, when ABS brakes and Air-Bags tend to become mandatory.

===T3===
{{Main|Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)}}

The '''T3''', known as the '''T25''' in Britain and Ireland, and '''Vanagon''' in Canada and the US, was built from May 1979 to 1991 (or July 1992 if one includes the syncro version), and was the third distinct generation of the Type 2.  It featured an all-new mechanical design that matched the T2 in length and height, but was wider by 12&nbsp;cm and considerably heavier.  Additional interior space was created by lowering the engine compartment; the rear door is 75% larger than the T2's. The suspension and almost all mechanical components were completely changed, and frontal crash protection was greatly increased.  The body was considerably squared-off, though retaining the overall impression of previous versions.  Body variants remained the same as before.

Until 1982, the T3 was available with the same air-cooled engines as the T2.  Starting in 1981, water-cooled [[diesel engine]]s were available options and for 1984, water-cooled [[gasoline]] boxer engines replaced the previous air-cooled ones.

From 1985, the '''T3 syncro''' represented the first production Type 2 with four-wheel drive.  The syncro drive system was full-time [[four-wheel drive]], with drive to the front axle controlled by a viscous coupling that delivered torque when required.  European syncros were normally fitted with front and rear pneumatically operated differential locks to improve traction.  These were not normally fitted to US-spec Vanagons due to fears over product liability.

[[Flat-4]] engine size and performance grew considerably over the T25's production run, from the 1.6 L, 50 DIN&nbsp;hp (37&nbsp;kW) and 2.0 L, 70 DIN&nbsp;hp (52&nbsp;kW) air-cooled engines to 1.9&nbsp;L water-cooled powerplants rated at 60 DIN&nbsp;hp (44&nbsp;kW) or 78 DIN&nbsp;hp (57&nbsp;kW) to the top-of the line 2.1 L, 112 DIN&nbsp;hp (82&nbsp;kW) (95&nbsp;hp for vans with [[catalytic converter]]s) fuel-injected version.  Likewise, the diesel engine grew to 1.9&nbsp;L and 65 DIN&nbsp;hp (48&nbsp;kW).  There was a turbodiesel option, but only in 1.6 L, 70 DIN&nbsp;hp (52&nbsp;kW) trim.  The 1.9&nbsp;L turbodiesel upgrade was not available until the introduction of the T4.

In its home market, the T3 was replaced by the T4 for the 1990 model year, but some syncro models and vehicles for [[Deutsche Post]] and the German [[military]] continued to be produced in [[Graz]], [[Austria]] until 1992.  The last German-built T3s were the very sought-after "Limited Last Edition" models of which 2,500 were built.

Meanwhile, the T3 was still being built in [[South Africa]], with a slightly modified body (larger windows, different ventilation, less room above the engine), fuel-injected four and five-cylinder inline engines and new equipment packages.  South African T3 production was halted in 2002.

==Post-Type 2 generations==
===T4===
{{Main|Volkswagen Transporter (T4)}}

Since 1990, the Transporter in most world markets has been front-engined and water-cooled, similar to other contemporary Volkswagens.  It is quite noteworthy that this happened almost two decades later than it did for the passenger cars, especially since commercial vehicles are usually not purchased for sentimental reasons.

VW Eurovan is the [[United States|US]] brand name. T4s are marketed as Transporter in Europe, the UK and Ireland.

===T5===
{{Main|Volkswagen Transporter (T5)}}

The '''Volkswagen Transporter T5''' range is the fifth generation of [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] medium sized [[light commercial vehicle]] and people movers. Launched 6 January 2003 the T5 went into full production in April 2003, replacing the fourth generation range.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.volkswagen-commercial-vehicles.com/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/en_vwn/unternehmen/chronikuebersicht/2001-heute.html www.volkswagen-commercial-vehicles.com]</ref>

Key markets for the T5 are Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and Turkey. It is not sold in the US market due to it being classed as a light truck, accuring the 25% chicken tax on importation. The T5 has a more aerodynamic design. The angle of the [[windshield]] and A-[[pillar (car)|pillar]] is less; this makes for a large [[dashboard]] and small hood.

In June 2009, VW announced the one-millionth T5 rolled off the production line in [[Hannover]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles builds one millionth T5|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/vwag/vwcorp/info_center/en/news/2009/06/vw_commercial_vehicles_builds_one_millionth_t5.html|work=[[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft]]|publisher=VolkswagenAG.com|date=30 June 2009|accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref>

==Additional developments==

In 2001, a [[Volkswagen Microbus Concept]] was created, with design cues from the T1 generation in a spirit similar to the New Beetle nostalgia movement.  Volkswagen planned to start selling it in the United States market in 2007, but it was scrapped in May 2004 and replaced with a more cost-effective design to be sold worldwide.

In 2006, the Brazilian branch of [[Volkswagen Group]] started selling a VW Bus with a new 1.4L water-cooled rear-mounted engine.  This marks the end of the Brazilian air-cooled engine era.  The "new" VW Bus (called "Kombi" in Brazil) uses the old generation T2 body.

==Names and nicknames==
Like the Beetle, from the beginning, the Type 2 earned many nicknames from its fans.  Among the most popular,{{citation needed|date=November 2009}} at least in Germany, are '''VW-Bus''' and '''Bulli''' (or '''Bully''') or '''Hippie-van''' or the bus.  The Type 2 was meant to be officially named the Bully, but [[Heinrich Lanz]], producer of the [[Lanz Bulldog]] farm tractor, intervened.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}  The model was then presented as the '''Volkswagen Transporter''' and '''Volkswagen Kleinbus''', but the Bully nickname still caught on.

The official German-language model names '''Transporter''' and '''Kombi''' (''Kombinationskraftwagen'', combined-use vehicle) have also caught on as nicknames. Kombi is not only the name of the passenger variant, but is also the [[Australasia]]n and [[Brazil]]ian term for the whole Type 2 family; in much the same way that they are all called '''VW-Bus''' in Germany, even the pickup truck variations.  In [[Mexico]], the German Kombi was translated as '''Combi''', and became a household word thanks to the vehicle's popularity in [[Mexico City]]'s public transportation system.  In [[Peru]], where the term Combi was similarly adopted, the term '''''Combi Asesina''''' (Murdering Combi) is often used for buses of similar size, due to the notorious recklessness and competition of bus drivers in [[Lima]] to get passengers.  In [[Portugal]] it is known as '''''Pão-de-Forma''''' (Breadloaf) because its design resembles a bread baked in a mold. Similarly, in [[Denmark]], the Type 2 is referred to as '''''Rugbrød''''' ([[Rye bread]]). [[Finland|Finns]] dubbed it '''''Kleinbus''''' (mini-bus), as many taxicab companies adopted it for group transportation; the name Kleinbus has become an appellative for all passenger vans.  The vehicle is also known as Kleinbus in [[Chile]].

In the United States, however, it is a VW bus, a "vee-dub", a minibus, a hippie-mobile, hippie bus, or hippie van, "combie", Microbus or a Transporter to aficionados.  The early versions produced before 1967 used a split front windshield (giving rise to the nickname "Splitty"), and their comparative rarity has led to their becoming sought after by collectors and enthusiasts.  The next version, sold in the USA market from 1968 to 1979, is characterised by a large, curved windshield and is commonly called a "bay-window".  It was replaced by the [[Vanagon]], of which only the [[Westfalia]] camper version has a common nickname, "Westy".

It was called '''Volksie Bus''' in South Africa, notable in a series of that country's TV commercials.  Kombi is also a generic nickname for vans and minibuses in South Africa and Swaziland, often used as a means of public transportation.

In the [[United Kingdom]], it is known as a "Campervan", "hippy van", "vdub", and as the more tongue-in-cheek "mind expanding van".

==Mexican production==

T2 production began in 1970 at the [[Puebla]] assembly factory. 

Offered as a 9 passenger version called the '''Volkswagen Combi''', and from 1973 as a cargo van called the ''Volkswagen Panel'', both variants were fitted with the 1.5 L aircooled boxer engine and 4 speed manual gearbox. In 1974, the 1.6 L 44 bhp boxer engine replaced the 1.5 previous one, and production continued this way up to 1987. In 1987 the watercooled 1.8 L inline 4 cyl. 85 bhp engine replaced the aricooled 1.6 L. This new model is recognizable by its black grille, bumpers and moldings. 

In 1988 a luxury variant, '''Volkswagen Caravelle''' made its debut in the Mexican market to compete with the [[Nissan Van C22 (Vanette)|Nissan Ichi Van]], which was available in cargo, passenger and luxury versions. 

The main differences between the two are that the Caravelle was sold as a 8 passenger version while the Combi was available as a 9 passenger version, the Caravelle was only painted in metallic colors, while the Combi was only available in white, and the Caravelle was fitted with an AM/FM stereo cassette sound system, velour upholstery, reading lights, mid and rear headrests, and wheel covers from the European T25 model. 

In 1989, the 10&nbsp;cm higher roof made its debut in all variants, and the Combi began to be offered in 8 or 9 passenger variants. In 1991, since Mexican anti-pollution regulations required a 3 way [[catalytic converter]], a Digifant [[fuel injection]] system replaced the previous [[carburetor]]. The three variants continued without change until 1994. 

In 1995 production ended in Mexico, with models imported from Brazil. The Caravelle was discontinued, the Combi was replaced by the T4 '''EuroVan Pasajeros''' and '''EuroVan Carga''', passenger and cargo van in long wheelbase version, 5 cyl. inline 2.5 L 115 bhp and 5 sp. manual gearbox imported from Germany.
