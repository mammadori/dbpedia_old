==History==

In 2001 [[Roland Gumpert]] proposed a new generation [[sports car]]. One of the first concerns of this car was that it be a street-legal car, ready for the race track. Gumpert returned to [[Germany]] at the end of 2001, after more than three years in [[China]]. There he was the head of sales and marketing, responsible for the development of the dealer network of the [[Audi]]-[[VW]] joint enterprise. Just after he returned to [[Germany]], [[Roland Meyer]] asked him if he would assist him in building a prototype sports car. [[Audi]] approved Gumpert's involvement in this project, on the condition that, if they did eventually develop a new sports car, it would not be a [[prototype]], but a series product.<ref name="PR Gumpert Dezember 2008_english">{{cite web|url=http://www.m5board.com/vbulletin/attachments/gtboard-com-general-sportscars/75991d1229461830-40th-gumpert-apollo-manifacturered-apollor-project-rleated-audi-r8-pr-gumpert-dezember-2008_english.pdf|format=PDF|title=PR Gumpert Dezember 2008_english|accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref>

The company was founded in 2004 under the name GMG Sportwagenmanufaktur
Altenburg GmbH. The technical guidelines were defined and the first designs of the car were drawn by [[Marco Vanetta]]. Upon Vanetta's completion of this process, the first 1:4 [[scale model]] of Gumpert's car was produced in 2002.

Gumpert continued with the development of the Apollo, along with the [[Technical University of Munich]] and the [[Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences]]. They have assisted with the [[construction|construction work]], [[simulation|computer simulations]], and [[wind tunnel|wind tunnel tests]]. This research and development helped forming the blueprint for the first 1:1 scale model. Finally two prototype apollos were constructed.<ref name="Gumpert Car" /><ref name="Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur - History">{{cite web|url=http://www.gumpert.de/eng/historie.html|title=Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur - History|accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref> .
