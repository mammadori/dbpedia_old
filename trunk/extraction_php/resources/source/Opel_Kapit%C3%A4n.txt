The Kapitän was the last new Opel model to appear before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], developed during 1938 and launched in the spring of 1939 at the Geneva motor show.  The first Kapitän was available in many different body styles, the most popular one being the 4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]. 2-door [[coupé]] [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolets]] were also built. The pre-[[World War II|war]] Kapitän featured a unitary body, a modern feature for its time.   The car inherited its 2.5 litre engine from [[Opel Super Six|its predecessor]]:  in this application a maximum speed of 118 km/h (73 mph) was reported<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197619>{{cite journal| authorlink = B Busch (Ferdinand Simoneit - Ed)| title = Als der Fürerschein eine Mark kostet: B Busch blickt in den Rückspiegel: 1938 | journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

Civilian automobile production by Opel ceased in the Fall / Autumn of 1940, by which time 25,371 Kapitäns had been produced:  a further three were assembled during 1943, giving a total production volume for the version launched in 1939 of 25,374.

Included in the production total were 248 of the two seater [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolets]] built for Opel by independent coach builders [[:de:Gläser-Karosserie GmbH|Gläser]] of [[Dresden]] and [[Hebmüller]] of Wülfrath in [[Wuppertal]].   There would, however, be no resurrection for the cabriolet Kapitäns in 1948 when the sedan / saloon version was reintroduced.

In October 1948, the Kapitän was re-introduced as a large six-cylinder saloon only, based on the 1939 version. The main differences were round headlights as opposed to hexagonal ones. From May 1950 the shifter was relocated from the floor to the steering column. The first post-war Kapitän reached a top speed of {{convert|126|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}, needed 29 seconds to reach {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} and consumed {{convert|13|L/100 km}} in the process.

Up to February 1951, 30.431 Kapitäns were built.

The 1951 Kapitän, introduced in March 1951, was a stylistically slightly modernized version of the old model; technically it was much the same. The engine's [[compression ratio]] rose from 6.0:1 to 6.25 to 1, its output from {{convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|58|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.

From March 1951 up to July 1953, Opel built 48,562 cars of this series.

In November 1954, Opel launched a completely new Kapitän that was longer and wider than its predecessor. Carried over was the six-cylinder engine, though its compression ratio was raised to 7.0:1, giving {{convert|68|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} initially. For 1955, output rose to {{convert|71|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and was further enhanced to {{convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for 1956. The ´54 featured a revised rear [[live axle]], a rear stabilizing bar and slightly enlarged drum brakes.

Model year 1956 saw a mild facelift with a more up-to-date grille, bezeled headlamps, larger front indicator lights and revised side trim. The ´56 reached a top speed of {{convert|140|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}} and consumed {{convert|13|L/100 km|abbr=on}}.

From May 1957, a semi-automatic 3-speed overdrive transmission with an additional fourth gear became available on request.

From November 1953 to February 1958, 154,098 Kapitäns were built. In its time, this generation was the third most popular car in Germany behind [[Volkswagen]]´s [[VW Beetle|Beetle]] and Opel's own [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]] (Oswald, p. 73).

The 1958 Kapitän (series P1), introduced in June 1958, was both wider and lower than its predecessor, and featured panoramic windows. It was only built for one year. This time, the 2.5 l-six's output was raised to {{convert|80|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Wheelbase, track widths, length and width were all slightly stretched, while a flatter roof made the car some {{convert|6|cm|in}} lower.

From June 1958 to June 1959, 34.282 cars were built.

The P2 Kapitän came to market in August 1959 and while it still had the panoramic windscreen, it gained a new grille and a redone body with a more angular roof and a new rear. It was driven by a stronger new, oversquare 2.6 liter-inline six (bore x stroke: 85 x 76.5 instead of 80 x 82 mm), still of [[Overhead valve|OHV]] and [[pushrod]] design. Carried over were the 3-speed and 4-speed overdrive transmission; the latter was replaced from December 1960 by a version of [[General Motors|GM]]´s 3-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic.

The P2 climbed to a top speed of {{convert|150|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}, reached {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 16 seconds and consumed {{convert|12|L/100 km|abbr=on}}.

From August 1959 to December 1963, Opel built 145,618 units of this Kapitän series.

The large Opels were never dominating players in their market segment on the same scale as the smaller [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]] and [[Opel Kadett|Kadett]] models, possibly due to the strength of [[Mercedes-Benz]] in the big car sector<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197715>{{cite journal| authorlink = Helmut Eicker (Ferdinand Simoneit - Ed)| title = Kurztest: Opel Diplomat | journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 15 1977| pages = Seite 58 - 63 |date = date 20 July 1977}}</ref>.     Nevertheless the highpoint for the big Opels was 1960 when together the Kapitän and [[Opel Admiral|Admiral]] were Europe's top selling six cylinder saloons, with nearly 48,000 sold<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197715/>.

In 1964, Opel introduced the completely new '''KAD''' (Kapitän, [[Opel Admiral|Admiral]], [[Opel Diplomat|Diplomat]]) models; the Kapitän served as the base model of this three-tier model range.

It was powered by the same engines as the contemporary [[Opel Admiral]], namely a 2.6 l-inline six or a 2.8 l-six; a few Kapitäns even received the [[Chevrolet]]-sourced 4.6 l-V8. For the Austrian market, 580 Kapitän and Admiral models received a 2.5 l-six with an output of {{convert|112|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in 1966/67.

Like its more expensive brethren, the Kapitän was reworked in late 1967 and received rub strips, a new [[ZF]] steering and a collapsible [[steering column]]. At the same time, a new HL (Hochleistung = high performance) version of the 2.8 l-six became available that put out {{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.

Sales of the Kapitän A fell sharply off; up to its discontinuation in November 1968, a total of 24,249 cars left the factory.

The Kapitän B was introduced in 1969 and was the last car bearing the Kapitän name. Engine options included a 1-bbl 2.8 l-inline six or a 2-bbl version of same, coupled with a 4-speed manual or Opel's 3-speed automatic transmission.

Production ended in May 1970. The Admiral and Diplomat lived on for another seven years until they were replaced by the [[Opel Senator|Senator]] in 1978.

Just 4,976 Kapitan B models were built in 15 months.
