==History==
===Foundations===
The company was founded by [[Gottlob Auwärter]] in [[Stuttgart]] in 1935,<ref name=NeoplanLocations/><ref name=Neoplan35-53/> and manufactured [[coachwork|bodywork]] for [[bus]] and [[truck]] chassis.<ref name=Neoplan35-53/>  From the beginning, the design of the buses produced was stylistic.  After [[World War II]], an all-[[steel]] body design was developed, a rarity at that time.<ref name=Neoplan35-53/>  The company became known for its technical expertise,<ref name=NeoplanHistory>{{cite web|title=History - The story of NEOPLAN Bus GmbH|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/History.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> and by 1953 had moved away from manufacturing buses on truck chassis,<ref name=Neoplan35-53/> to a partial [[monocoque]] design with a steel tube skeleton, providing the structural support,<ref name=Neoplan35-53/><ref name=NeoplanHistory/> enhanced by welded side panels.<ref name=Neoplan35-53/>  The engine was moved to the [[rear-engine design|rear]],<ref name=Neoplan35-53/> and the running gear and body functioned as one. In 1957, [[air suspension]]<ref name=NeoplanHistory/> was made available, greatly improving the ride of the bus for the passenger.

===1960s===
In 1961, a new design, the [[Neoplan Hamburg|Hamburg]],<ref name=Neoplan61-64>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 1961 to 1964|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1961_to_1964.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> was unveiled at the [[Geneva Motor Show|Geneva Salon]] and caused a sensation in the industry.  At a time when most coaches were rounded, bulbous or streamlined, the new design had clear-cut lines with edges and large windows.<ref name=Neoplan61-64/>  Developed by the founder's eldest son [[Albrecht Auwärter]] and another student, Swiss [[Bob Lee]], as part of their dissertation at Hamburg University, the design also allowed every passenger to regulate fresh air supply through a nozzle from two air ducts.<ref name=Neoplan61-64/>

Both Albrecht and Lee joined NEOPLAN after university.  Albrecht took over management of the company in 1965.  Bob Lee became head of Engineering and Design.

In 1964, the founder's second son, [[Konrad Auwärter]], developed a [[double-decker bus|double-deck design]] for a service bus as part of his dissertation.<ref name=Neoplan61-64/>  The 'Do-Bus' design had extremely low weight, and could carry over 100 passengers.<ref name=Neoplan61-64/>  It also featured a low-frame front [[axle]] with forward-mounted [[steering]] gear that permitted a low flat floor.<ref name=NeoplanHistory/><ref name=Neoplan61-64/>  The double-deck principle was applied to coach design, creating a revolutionary high-capacity comfortable vehicle for touring.  This vehicle was known as the [[Neoplan Skyliner|Skyliner]],<ref name=Neoplan65-71>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 1965 to 1971|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1966_to_1971.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> and created an image for the company that differentiated the NEOPLAN brand from its competitors, and created interest in its products across Europe.

===1970s===
In 1971, the [[Neoplan Cityliner|Cityliner]] was introduced.<ref name=Neoplan65-71/>  This design had a passenger platform at a level above the driver's cab, and included an onboard toilet.<ref name=Neoplan65-71/>  The vehicle also made use, for the first time, of [[glass-reinforced plastic|glass-fibre reinforced plastic]] for certain areas of the body.<ref name=Neoplan65-71/>  In 1973, the [[Neoplan Jetliner|Jetliner]] was introduced,<ref name=Neoplan72-75>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 1972 to 1975|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1972_to_1975.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> featuring a large one-piece [[windshield|windscreen]], with the driver and door windows sloping from the passenger window line down to the bottom of the windscreen level.<ref name=Neoplan72-75/>

A second manufacturing facility opened in [[Pilsting]] in 1973,<ref name=NeoplanLocations/><ref name=Neoplan72-75/> and a third opening in [[Kumasi]], Ghana in December 1974<ref name=NeoplanLocations/> to support a large order.<ref name=Neoplan72-75/>

The double-deck Skyliner concept was taken to its ultimate conclusion in 1975, with the introduction of the [[Neoplan Jumbocruiser|Jumbocruiser]],<ref name=Neoplan72-75/> a double-deck articulated coach {{convert|18|m|ftin|0|lk=on}} long<ref name=NeoplanHistory/><ref name=Neoplan72-75/> and {{convert|4|m|ftin|0}} high.<ref name=Neoplan72-75/>  The [[Neoplan Spaceliner|Spaceliner]],<ref name=Neoplan76-81>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 1976 to 1981|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1976_to_1981.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> introduced in 1979 took the Cityliner concept of passenger floor level above the driver, and extended the actual floor above the cab.  This kept the height of the vehicle lower than a double-decker, at {{convert|3.65|m|0}}, but still allowed installation of toilets, kitchens or sleep cabins below the passenger compartment.<ref name=Neoplan76-81/>

===1980s===
A new fourth plant was added in 1981 in [[Berlin]],<ref name=Neoplan76-81/> and Bob Lee led the establishment of a [[Neoplan USA|fifth plant]] in [[Lamar, Colorado]].  In 1984, a further plant was added in [[Honey Brook, Pennsylvania]].  The US plants were later spun off into a separate, and now defunct, independent company ([[Neoplan USA]]) that used the NEOPLAN name under license.

In 1980, the [[United Kingdom]] deregulated services over {{convert|35|mi|0|lk=on}} in length.  This led to intense competition on a variety of long-distance services, with operators looking to differentiate their service.  NEOPLAN vehicles, with their futuristic design and high quality construction, began to be imported in greater numbers.  These vehicles, so different from the products of the UK coachbuilders [[Duple Coachbuilders|Duple]] and [[Plaxton]], became increasingly popular.  In particular the Skyliner, with its head-turning design, comfort, and high capacity, became a status symbol for many operators of the period, in particular, Trathens Travel Services of [[Plymouth]].

The [[Neoplan Metroliner|Metroliner]] was introduced in 1988.<ref name=Neoplan82-91>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 1982 to 1991|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1982_to_1991.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref>  This vehicle was the first full monocoque bus in the world, requiring no separate chassis or skeleton.<ref name=Neoplan82-91/>

===1990s===
A manufacturing facility was opened in [[Ehrenhain]] in 1990.<ref name=Neoplan82-91/>

In 1992, the {{convert|15|m|ftin|0}} four-axle [[Neoplan Megaliner|Megaliner]] was introduced,<ref name=Neoplan92-96>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 1992 to 1996|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1992_to_1996.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> prompting a change in [[European Union]] regulations to allow non-articulated vehicles greater than {{convert|12|m|ftin|0}} in length.  The [[Neoplan Starliner|Starliner]] was introduced in 1996,<ref name=Neoplan92-96/> and would go on to win the ''Bus of the Year'' award for two consecutive years - in 1998 and 1999.<ref name=Neoplan97-99>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 1997 to 1999|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1997_to_1999.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref>

===2000s===
In 2001, NEOPLAN, or correctly, "Gottlob Auwärter GmbH & Co KG" was acquired by [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] subsidy [[MAN Nutzfahrzeuge|MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG]]<ref name=Neoplan00-02>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 2000 to 2002|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/2000_to_2002.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> to form [[Neoman Bus|NEOMAN Bus GmbH]].  The Starliner wins the ''Bus of the Year'' award for two more years in 2001 and 2002.<ref name=Neoplan00-02/>

A new coach designed for touring was introduced in 2003 under the name [[Neoplan Tourliner|Tourliner]],<ref name=Neoplan03-04>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 2003 to 2004|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/2003_to_2004.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> and the Starliner was redesigned in 2004, representing arguably the most futuristic vehicle yet to bear the NEOPLAN name, and included technical advancements such as [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP).<ref name=Neoplan03-04/>

The [[Neoplan Trendliner|Trendliner]] was released in 2004,<ref name=Neoplan03-04/> as a 'dual purpose' intercity and combination bus - which is designed to be used seven days a week.<ref name=Neoplan03-04/>

In 2005, two new shorter {{convert|13|m|ftin|0}} versions of the Tourliner and Trendliner were released.<ref name=Neoplan05-07>{{cite web|title=Milestones - History from 2005 to 2007|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/2005_to_2007.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref>  From 2006, Euro4 compliant engines from MAN began being fitted in the new generation [[Neoplan Cityliner|Cityliner]].<ref name=Neoplan05-07/>

In 2007, a new [[Auwärter Museum]] was opened in [[Landau]]/[[Isar]].<ref name=Neoplan05-07/>

On 1 February 2008, NEOMAN Bus GmbH was fully integrated into the Bus Division of the larger MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group, and ceased to exist in its own right.  NEOPLAN and [[MAN AG Buses]] now operate as two separate but integrated marques of MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group.<ref>{{cite web|title=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge integrates the Bus Division|url=http://www.man-mn.com/en/media/Press_releases/show_press.jsp?id=150102|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=MAN-mn.de|date=30 January 2008|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>  As a result of the reorganisation and restructuring of the Bus Division, NEOPLAN will concentrate on production at its Plauen and Pilsting sites, with Plauen being used for premium luxury coaches, whilst Pilsting will concentrate on customisations.<ref>{{cite web|title=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge plans to concentrate the NEOPLAN coach production in Plauen|url=http://www.man-mn.com/en/media/Press_releases/show_press.jsp?id=154669|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=MAN-mn.de|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>
