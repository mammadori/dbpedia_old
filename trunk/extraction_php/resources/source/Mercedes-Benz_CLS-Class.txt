[[Image:Mercedes-Benz C219 rear 20080620.jpg|thumb|CLS 500]]
The '''Mercedes-Benz CLS''' is an executive-size [[sedan (car)|sedan]] based on the [[Mercedes-Benz W211|W211]] [[E-Class]] platform. Marketed as a 'four door [[coupe]],' the CLS recalls the [[fastback]] saloon designs of [[Robert Opron]] in the 1970s. According to a [[Mercedes-Benz]] press release, the CLS-class was produced to combine the "strong, emotive charisma" of a coupe with the "comfort and practicality" of a saloon. Save for its four-door design, the CLS's design tends towards a coupe, as its sleek roofline reduces the rear passenger room to a [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2 arrangement]], and it offers a smaller selection of engines tending towards high powered of the range, compared to contemporary sedans such as the [[E-Class]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.edmunds.com/mercedesbenz/clsclass/review.html|publisher=Edmunds|title=CLS class review}}</ref>

The current iteration of the CLS is internally designated as the C219 and it was first offered for sale in Europe in autumn 2004. It is assembled by [[Daimler AG]] in [[Sindelfingen]], [[Germany]] and [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes-Benz-Valdez]] in [[Santiago Tianguistenco]], [[Mexico]].

==Background==
The CLS marked Mercedes-Benz's return to the [[executive car|executive-size]] coupe market since the ([[W124]]) E-Class Coupe (a [[Sedan_%28car%29#Two-door_sedan|two-door sedan]]) went out of production in 1995. The ([[Mercedes-Benz W210|W210]]) E-Class did not spawn a coupe variant, as Mercedes-Benz choose instead to introduce a smaller coupe based on the compact [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|C-Class]], the [[CLK-Class]]. However, the CLK-Class was built with a lengthened C-Class wheelbase so it could be slotted as a [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] vehicle, and it also featured styling cues, engines, and similar pricing to the (W210) E-Class to give the impression that the (W124) E-Class Coupe was directly replaced.

The CLS name also caused some to confuse it as the four-door version of the [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class|CL-Class]], the full-sized coupe based on the S-Class. Indeed, the styling cues of the next generation [[Mercedes-Benz C216|C216]] CL have been strongly influenced by the CLS.

Priced to slot between the mid-sized E-Class and the full-sized [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]], it competes in the range which was previously solely occupied by the [[BMW 6-series]]. Prior to the launch of the CLS, Mercedes had no direct answer to the executive-sized 6-series which positioned itself between the compact/mid-sized CLK and the full-sized CL. The CLK is slotted between the [[BMW 3 series]] coupe/cabriolet and the 6 series coupe/cabriolet, while the CL has no direct competitor. Others maintain, however, that the CLS has no direct competitor.<ref>[http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/2008-Mercedes-Benz-CLS/ 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLS Reviews, Photos, Options and Pricing - Best Cars & Trucks - U.S. News Rankings and Reviews<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During its development, Mercedes-Benz executives nicknamed the CLS the "Jag fighter," hoping that it would be the type of vehicle that Jaguar customers would be attracted to. Jaguar, however, has not launched a four-door coupe since production until recently announced as the 2009 Jaguar XF sedan. Due to the popularity of the CLS-Class, other manufacturers are offering similar four-door sedans.

==W219==

The first generation of the CLS, the [[Mercedes-Benz C219]], is based upon the [[Mercedes-Benz W219|W219]] platform, a [[Mercedes-Benz W211|W211]] E-Class spin-off that is six inches (152&nbsp;mm) longer.

The CLS-class was first displayed as the Vision CLS concept at the 2003 [[Frankfurt]] International Motor Show. The production version '''CLS 500''' made its debut at the 2004 [[New York International Auto Show]]. A new [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] model was introduced at the 2004 [[Paris Motor Show]], the '''CLS 55 AMG'''. Only 3,000 CLS 55 AMG cars will be built each year.

The CLS was first offered for sale in the [[United States]] in January 2005; the CLS 550, CLS 55 AMG and CLS 63 AMG are sold in the United States. The CLS 550 has a base price of [[United States dollar|US$]]65,620, with the CLS 55 starting at US$87,320. CLS63 starts at $92,500 for a base model, and is offered with steering wheel mounted paddles (F1 style), and 19" wheels for the US market.

The CLS 350 and CLS 500 have a 7-speed [[automatic transmission]].

A diesel version, CLS 320 CDI, is available for the European market with a 3 [[liter]] [[V6]] producing 224 [[horsepower|hp]] (167[[watt|kW]]) and 510 N.m (376&nbsp;lbf) of torque. For model year 2007 (MY2007), the engine found in the CLS 320 CDI is updated to produce 540N.m, although Peak power remains unchanged

[[IVM Automotive]], a subsidiary of German roof system specialist [[Edscha]], developed the entire vehicle from the Vision concept to the production version. More than 150 IVM engineers were involved, making the CLS the largest vehicle development project in the company's history.

Mercedes-Benz has planned a yearly production of 30,000 units worldwide, of which about 10,000 will be shipped to the U.S. market.

For the model year 2007, Mercedes-Benz has replaced the CLS 55 AMG with the CLS 63 AMG. The CLS 63 uses the newly developed [[Mercedes-Benz M156 engine|AMG M156]] naturally aspirated V8 engine capable of 514 hp (378&nbsp;kW) and 630 N·m (464&nbsp;ft·lbf) of torque. This results in a 0-60 mph time of 4.3 and 3.9 seconds for the CLS55 AMG and CLS63 AMG respectively.

===Specifications===
In the 2007 model year, the CLS-Class' powertrains include one of the following [[engine]]s:

* '''CLS 350''' - A 3.5&nbsp;L [[V6]], generating 200&nbsp;kW (292&nbsp;hp DIN), and 350&nbsp;N·m (258&nbsp;[[Foot-pound|ft·lbf]]) at 2,400&nbsp;[[rpm]]
* '''CLS 500 (CLS 550 in the US market)''' - A 5.5&nbsp;L [[V8]], generating 281&nbsp;kW (382&nbsp;hp DIN),
* '''CLS 63 [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]]''' - A 6.2&nbsp;L [[V8]], generating 378&nbsp;kW (514&nbsp;hp DIN), and {{convert|630|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}
* '''CLS 320 CDI''' - A 3.0&nbsp;L [[V6]] [[Turbo]] [[Diesel engine|Diesel]], generating 167&nbsp;kW (224&nbsp;hp DIN), and {{convert|540|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} (European market only).
* '''CLS 350 CGI''' - A 3.5&nbsp;L [[gasoline direct injection|direct-injected]] [[V6]], generating 215&nbsp;kW (292&nbsp;hp DIN), and {{convert|365|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}

==Features==
Mercedes-Benz has put all of its latest safety features into the CLS-class. In addition to front [[airbag]]s, there are side-impact airbags in the front seats and side curtain airbags throughout. The car features a "smart" sensor system for the seatbelts and airbags that can detect and react to accident severity. An optional [[Pre-Safe]] system predicts an impending [[collision]]; when the system is activated, the [[seatbelts]] tighten, the front passenger seat adjusts to crash positioning, and the [[sunroof]] closes automatically. Mercedes-Benz engineers describe the feature as a human-like reflex system.

[[Image:Mercedes CLS Facelift rear.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Mercedes-Benz CLS (Europe)]]
The air suspension has three settings. The default setting, "Comfort," is ideal under normal driving conditions, stiffening as the car's speed increases. "Sport 1" and "Sport 2" settings give the car more agility on winding and bumpy roads. The car can also be raised three inches (76&nbsp;mm) , if needed.

The CLS-class comes with a choice of four interior colors, three types of leather and two kinds of wood. Leather interior comes standard, with Nappa leather upholstery available on designo models. Burl walnut and dark laurel wood interior trim are available in either a high-gloss or silk matte finish. Leather colors include Black, Basalt Gray, Sunset Red and Cashmere. New scratch-resistant exterior paint is three times as durable as past exterior finishes.

There are 33 inches (838&nbsp;mm) of rear legroom, which is not quite as accommodating as the 35.6 inches (904&nbsp;mm) available in the E-Class. Elbow room is generous at 57 inches (1448&nbsp;mm). The trunk can hold 16 cubic feet (453 L) of cargo.

The following features are standard in all models: heated auto-dimming mirrors, outside temperature gauge, rain-sensing wipers and projector-beam [[headlights]]. Also standard is a Thermatic automatic [[climate control]] system; this system assesses and adjusts interior temperature and humidity levels and filters the air in the cabin. There are dual controls in both the front and rear seats.

Other available features include: self-cleaning [[bi-xenon HID headlamp]]s, distronic radar-guided [[cruise control]], power [[sunroof]], keyless go, drive authorization system and Parktronic parking sensors. Available electronics include: COMAND control system, GPS navigation and [[surround sound]] audio.

The CLS 55 AMG and CLS 63 AMG are modified versions of the CLS produced by [[Mercedes-AMG]]. Features exclusive to AMG models include: perforated sport seats, 18 inch (457&nbsp;mm) light-alloy wheels with wider tires (for the UK), 19 inch five spoke light-alloy wheels (standard in North America, optional for all other markets), large air inlets and quad chromed oval exhaust pipes.
