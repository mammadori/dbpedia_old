The '''SP2''' was a sports car developed by [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] for that market, from 1972 to 1976; the name is an [[acronym]] for "São Paulo".
== Origins of the project ==
In the 70s, the Brazilian market was closed for imports. The only sports car officially made there was the aging (and by then retired) [[Karmann Ghia]], and its failed successor, the [[Karmann Ghia]] TC. Only independent car makers were able to fill the gap, notably [[Puma (car)|Puma]], [[Santa Matilde]] and [[Miura (Brazilian car)|Miura]].

=== "Project X" ===
The Volkswagen subsidiary in Brazil always had some degree of independence from Wolfsburg, so in 1969 they decided to start a new project of their own. A team led by Senor Schiemann and supported by Rudolf Leiding (the CEO of the subsidiary and later of the entire company) started work on a so called "Project X", and presented a prototype in a 1971 fair. But it would take another year before the car reached the streets.

== Production models ==
The SP, the final name of the car, was built on the frame of a [[Volkswagen TL|Variant]], with the same [[Volkswagen air cooled engine]], but upgraded to 1700 [[Cubic metre|cc]], it developed {{Convert|75|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, 160 km/h (100&nbsp;mph) and made 10 km with a litre (24&nbsp;mpg).

When the car was presented, it quickly drew media attention, with its many improvements over the local "air cooled" VW line, an impressive interior, its many extra features and its superb finishing.

== Decline ==

A car named SP1 was also built, but due to its very poor performance (only {{Convert|65|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with a 1600&nbsp;cc engine), it was soon discontinued. The same  problem plagued the SP2. In fact, a malicious joke at that time was to relate the "SP2" name with "Sem Potência" ("Without Power", in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]).

Despite its revolutionary look, the car failed to beat the [[Puma (car)|Puma]] in performance. Although they used similar engines, the [[fiberglass]] Puma was much lighter. This resulted in low sales, and the SP was discontinued in February 1976.

With a total of 10,205 units made (670 of them exported to Europe), the car is now sought-after as a valuable collector's item. One of them, in white, is in the VW museum on public display. While prices during the production time frame were roughly the same as the Beetle, the price of a well-preserved example today is considerably higher than contemporary VW models.

==SP3==
An attempt to resolve SP's main problem, lack of engine power, was called '''"SP3 project"'''. It would be basically an SP2, but with a 1.8L EA-827 (AP in Brazil) engine, watercooled, 8,5:1, 100 cv SAE at 6000 rpm and twin carburetors, all "borrowed" from the Brazilian version of the [[Passat]] TS. Although at the factory, a [[prototype]] was made at '''Dacon'''<ref name="Quatro Rodas">See [http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/classicos/brasileiros/conteudo_143486.shtml this article] (18/11/2006).</ref>.
<!--Externamente, o carro tinha rodas pretas aro 13, tala 6, do Passat; as aletas de ventilação foram substituídas por discretas fendas próximas à janela traseira, e uma grade preta (também do Passat) tomava toda a extensão da seção sobre o pára-choque. O motor permanecia na traseira, junto com o compressor do [[ar-condicionado]]. O [[radiador]] ficava na dianteira, junto da [[ventoinha]], e a conexão com o motor se fazia pelo tubo central do [[chassis]]. Bancos [[Porsche]] (a Dacon representava esta marca antes da proibição das importações) compunham o interior, que recebia acabamento em preto. A transmissão, a suspensão e os freios (discos na frente e tambor atrás) eram os mesmos do SP2, porém recalibrados para a maior potência do carro.
O protótipo chegava a {{Auto km/h|180|0}} de máxima. Infelizmente, apesar do entusiasmo inicial que o carro gerou, a fábrica decidiu que os custos necessários para se viabilizar a produção seriam altos demais, e o projeto foi abandonado. A concessionária chegou a oferecer o serviço de "conversão" dos SP2 normais para SP3, porém o preço proibitivo (cerca de 100.000,00 [[cruzeiros]])<ref name="Quatro Rodas">Veja esta [http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/classicos/brasileiros/conteudo_143486.shtml reportagem da revista Quatro Rodas] (Acessada em 18/11/2006).</ref> esfriou as vendas. Atualmente o projeto "sobrevive" em réplicas construídas por entusiastas, seja utilizando SP2 genuínos modificados ou seja construíndo o automóvel inteiro em [[fibra de vidro]].-->
