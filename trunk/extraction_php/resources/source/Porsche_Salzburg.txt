'''Porsche Salzburg''' was an entrant in the [[1969 World Sportscar Championship season]] and [[1970 World Sportscar Championship season]], representing [[Porsche in motorsport]].

In the late 1960s, Porsche entered many sports cars in races, and to support the factory effort (then calling itself [[Porsche System Engineering]]), external semi-factory teams were set up to share the work load. In 1969, ''Porsche Salzburg'' became such a ''de facto'' second works team, sponsored by Porsche's Austrian dealership which was owned by [[Louise Piëch]], daughter of [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and mother of [[Ferdinand Piëch]], thus under control of members of the Porsche family. Early in the season, at the Nürburgring, cars were entered as ''Salzburg Porsche Konstruktionen'', but later at Austria's [[Österreichring]], it was Porsche Salzburg for short. 

In 1970, the team of [[John Wyer]] was the designated factory partner. The Porsche factory itself did not compete anymore, focussing on development, but Salzburg continued. Usually two cars were entered, for [[Vic Elford]] and [[Hans Herrmann]]. Salzburg operated the winning [[Porsche 908]] in the [[1000km Nürburgring]] and the winning [[Porsche 917]] at the [[1970 24 Hours of Le Mans]].

After 1970, the name of Porsche Salzburg disappeared from entry lists, as [[Martini Racing]] took over as the second factory-backed team besides Wyer.
