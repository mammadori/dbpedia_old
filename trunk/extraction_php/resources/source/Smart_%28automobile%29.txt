'''Smart'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smart.com |title=smart corporate home page}}</ref>, formerly '''Smart GmbH''' (formerly MCC Smart GmbH), an automotive brand of [[Daimler AG]], is a manufacturer of [[microcar]]s and [[supermini car|superminis]] based in [[Böblingen]], [[Germany]], produced in [[Hambach, Moselle|Hambach]] (France).

It is marketed as the "smart" in all lower-case, with the current Smart brand logo denoting a letter "c" for "compact" and an arrow for "forward thinking".

==Company history==
The idea behind the car was to create a vehicle easy to park and short enough to allow "nose-in" parking. Its length of 250 centimeters would equal the width of a regular parking slot, allowing two or three Smarts to park in the same space as one normal car.
The project, started by Swiss watch manufacturer [[Swatch]], was nicknamed the "Swatchmobile".  The name Smart is an [[acronym]] for ''Swatch Mercedes ART''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Swatch+Mercedes+Art+(Daimler-Benz+automobile+model) |title=SMART |publisher=Acronyms.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref> Intended to use innovative features (such as a [[Hybrid car|hybrid engine]]) and be affordable for young people, the Smart had similar design objective to the [[Citroën 2CV]] of the 1940s.

Swatch CEO [[Nicolas Hayek]] sought an established car maker to produce his Swatch car. After [[General Motors]] reviewed and rejected the project as potentially unprofitable, Hayek found a partner in [[Volkswagen]]. Due to VW's own financial weakness at the time, plans never reached a final stage so Swatch teamed up with [[Daimler-Benz]]. The purpose-built factory complex ''Smartville'' in [[Hambach, Moselle|Hambach]], [[France]], was established in 1994 as a joint-venture of [[Daimler-Benz]] and [[Swatch]].

An Australian dealer web site provides the following summary of the beginnings of the product:
<blockquote>
"How everything began: In 1993 Mercedes-Benz started a feasibility study on a subcompact car. Together with the Swatch Group Ltd. they founded the Micro Compact Car AG in 1994. The Smart city-coupé celebrates its world première at the IAA in Frankfurt (Germany) in 1997 and is one year successfully launched in nine European countries. By now, the Smart is available in 37 countries all over the world and was sold over 750,000 times."<ref>[http://www.Smartaustralia.com.au/inside-Smart/about-Smart.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref>
</blockquote>
<!--The important features of this quote are the names and dates.--[[User:Retirededitor|Retirededitor]] 02:12, 1 April 2007 (UTC)-->

The final car design proved to be far from Hayek's expectations: its engine eco-technology was outside of Mercedes' goal. The joint venture experienced heavy losses and dispute when Swatch pulled out.

In 2005, DaimlerChrysler decided against purchasing a 50% share in the Dutch [[NedCar]] plant used to manufacture the [[Smart Forfour|Forfour]] [[supermini car|supermini]]. DaimlerChrysler also halted development on the [[Smart Formore|Formore]] and decided to discontinue production of the [[Smart Roadster|Roadster]].

In 2006, after dwindling sales, Smart GmbH was liquidated and its operations were absorbed within the Mercedes-Benz automobile group. Smart GmbH lost nearly 4 billion euros from 2003 to 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.motortrend.com/6209443/car-news/Smarts-three-year-loss-more-than-5-billion-report-says/index.html |title=Smart's three-year loss more than $5 billion, report says &#124; Car News Blog at Motor Trend |publisher=Blogs.motortrend.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>

==Models==
Apart from the original short [[Smart Fortwo]], a sporty [[Smart Roadster]], a limited production of 2000 concept [[Smart Crosstown]] and a [[supermini car|supermini]] [[Smart Forfour]] were also offered. These have now been discontinued. There were also plans to introduce the french made [[Crossover (automobile)|cross-over]] based on the body of the ForFour and the [[Four-wheel drive|AWD]] hardware of the Mercedes C-class with the name of [[Smart Formore|Formore]] but industrialization of this was cancelled at the 11th hour (even as tooling was being installed in the assembly plant) due to unfavourable exchange rate swings and spending cutbacks driven by losses elsewhere within Smart.

An [[electric vehicle|electric]], rechargeable version is being released in the UK as a [[lease]] vehicle on a limited basis. At the Smart Car Brooklands event in July 2008, a Smart EV was on display within "MercedesWorld" and a representative stated that the car would be for sale in the UK in 2010. Daimler will start the production of the electric Smart equipped with [[lithium-ion]] batteries in 2009 and production will ramp up to mass production by 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/0,1518,576074,00.html |title=City-Flitzer mit Batterie: Daimler will mit Elektro-Smart in Serie gehen - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - Auto |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>
A [[Smart Forfour]] has been converted into a [[plug-in hybrid]] by [[Lithium Technology Corporation]] and [[Zytek]] Systems. The [[lithium-ion battery]] can propel the vehicle up to {{convert|84|mph}} and last on its own for up to {{convert|20|mi}}. The engine is a combination of a {{convert|68|hp|adj=on}}, {{convert|1.5|l|cuin|adj=on|sp=us}}, 3-cylinder turbo charged diesel engine and two high-efficiency [[permanent-magnet electric motor]]s.

Daimler AG and [[RWE]] AG have launched the world's largest joint project for environmentally friendly electric cars. Daimler will provide more than 100 electric cars from Mercedes-Benz and Smart as well as the vehicle service.The new generation of Smart ED (electric drive) and electric-battery driven vehicles from Mercedes-Benz will come in use within the "[[e-mobility Berlin]]" project. RWE is handling the development, installation and operation of the charging infrastructure". The new project is also benefiting from the experience gained by Daimler during the current pilot project involving electro-mobility in London. Since last year, there has been a test fleet of first-generation [[Smart Fortwo ed]] cars . The start of [[serial production]] of battery-powered vehicles by Mercedes-Benz and Smart is in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/09/05/daimler-announces-deal-with-rwe-500-berlin-charging-points-lit/ |title=Daimler announces deal with RWE, 500 Berlin charging points, lithium Smart |publisher=Autobloggreen.com |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>

=== Electric vehicle conversions ===
{{Main|Electric vehicle conversion}}

[[eSmart]] is a Smart Fortwo electric conversion. It has  a 40&nbsp;km range with [[AGM]]  batteries  (100&nbsp;km with [[Li-ion]] batteries)

==Smart in Asia==
===Japan===
Older Smart cars equipped with engine sizes smaller than {{convert|660|cm3}} fit into the [[Kei car]] category of cars in [[Japan]], and are eligible for a range of lower taxes. However, recent models with a larger engine do not meet the Kei qualifications.  Because of high taxation on older cars in Japan, many older used Smart cars are exported to other countries with [[right-hand drive]], like [[Great Britain]] and [[South Africa]]. An official version of the [[Smart Fortwo]]  called the 'Smart K' has been released to fit the [[Kei car]] category.

===China===
Smart was shown in April 2008 at the [[Beijing Auto Show]] 2008.
Smart Fortwo started the pre-sales in October 2008 and the [[Smart vending machine]] road show in 12 cities from October 2008 to February 2009.

===Hong Kong===
Smart is already available in [[Hong Kong]] with one authorized dealer.

==Smart in North America==
===Canada===
[[Image:Nuvola-blue-smart-fortwo-2.jpg|thumb|The [[Smart Fortwo]]]]

The [[Smart Fortwo]] was introduced in [[Canada]] in late 2004 and was sold through [[Mercedes-Benz]] dealers.  Demand has been heavy with up to 6-month waiting lists in major urban areas in the spring of 2005. The vehicle has been especially popular for light errand running for small shops and businesses, with many carrying custom paint jobs or stick-on graphics boldly advertising the associated product or service. However, recently the demand seems to have tapered off,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and some 2005 Smart Fortwos have popped up in the used car market. Canadian Smart CDIs cannot be registered in the US.

As of June 1, 2007, 9,200 Smart Fortwo CDI's had been sold in Canada, and as of the end of the model 450 production run, 10,239 of these cars were in this country.  This large stock is because as the model 450 ended production, after a run of 770,256 cars, Mercedes-Benz Canada built-up stock to tide dealers over until the successor model 450 arrived at the end of 2007.

The Canadian version of the Smart Fortwo cdi sold to 915 customers over three months in 2004; 4080 were sold in 2005; and 3023 in 2006.  Virtually all the deliveries in 2004 and many of the deliveries in 2005 were to long-time Smart fans who had been waiting for their car for years, which largely accounts for the higher numbers.  Although sales tapered off in late 2006 and the first couple of months of 2007, they rebounded strongly in March 2007 and this trend continued through April, culminating with May 2007, marking the car's strongest sales performance ever in Canada, at well over 500 units.  Sales are strongest (per capita) in Western Canada, with Vancouver Island and Vancouver being especially hot markets for Smart.

The 2007 (Europe) and 2008 (North America) Smart Fortwo 451 saw an engine displacement increase to 1 full litre up from 700 cc with the attendant loss of fuel economy.  Sales of the  diesel engine was restricted in certain markets in favor of the Mitsubishi gasoline unit. Currently, in North America, Smarts are sold  with the larger gas engine in the US and Canada, with the smaller, more fuel efficient diesel being sold in Mexico, Europe and other World markets.

===United States===<!-- This section is linked from [[Vidoop]] -->
[[File:Smart DCA 07 2009 Front view 6430.JPG|thumb|[[Smart Fortwo#Second generation|Smart Fortwo (2nd generation)]] parked in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Before 2008, Smart cars were only available in the United States as "[[Grey import vehicles|grey market]]" imports, such as [[ZAP (motor company)|ZAP]].  U.S. federal regulations allow certain grey market importing in large quantities provided the vehicles are modified and tested to conform to U.S. safety and emissions regulations. Smart cars were imported into the United States by "The Defiance Company LLC", modified by G&K Automotive Conversion in [[Santa Ana, California]], and distributed and sold by independent dealerships which were not affiliated with Mercedes. U.S. regulations did not permit the purchase and import of used Smart CDi vehicles from Canada, as the diesel powered Canadian Smarts did not meet American emissions regulations.

In June 2006, DaimlerChrysler confirmed that Smart would be officially launched in the United States in the first quarter of 2008. The cars are offered through a dealership holding company [[Penske Automotive Group]], which created a new U.S. dealership network for the brand under the name Smart USA.<ref>[http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-7145-1-622018-1-0-0-0-0-0-9-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Smart Vehicles Go USA] {{dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref> Initially, an updated gasoline powered [[Smart Fortwo|Fortwo]] was offered, starting around US$12,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Smartusa.com/Smart-car-Fortwo-pure.html |title=Smart Fortwo pure |publisher=Smartusa.com |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref> The new model made its debut at European auto shows in November 2006.

"Hybrid Technologies" plans to sell an electric version of the Smart vehicle in the U.S. starting at [[United States dollar|US$]]35,000. It is being called a [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid car]] even though the vehicle is all-electric.  The electric Smart car will have a range of {{convert|120|to-|150|mi}}, a top speed of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and charge in 5 to 6 hours using a standard {{nowrap|110 V AC}} outlet. An electric Smart is currently undergoing testing in the UK and will only be offered to commercial clients as a trial for the time being.<ref>[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/10/the_Smart_ev_co.php The Smart EV: Coming Soon to the Public?]{{dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/18/earlyshow/main1813005.shtml |title="Pull Plug On High Gas Prices" |publisher=CBS News |date=2006-07-18 |accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>

A ''Forbes'' article has been critical of the stated reasons that Daimler-Chrysler gave for introducing the car in the United States.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2006/07/12/unsolicited-advice-advertising-meb_0712smart.html Is Smart A Dumb Idea? - Forbes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{date=August 2009}}</ref> The Smart fortwo is the most fuel-efficient gasoline-engined car for sale in the US; however, according to the EPA, the Smart's fuel efficiency is lower than the fuel efficiency of some hybrids such as the [[Toyota Prius]], the [[Honda Civic Hybrid]], and the 2-seat [[Honda Insight]] (making it the fourth most fuel efficient vehicle in the U.S.), which achieve 45/48, 45/40, and 61/70 respectively while the Smart achieves 33 city and 41 highway, though the Smart fortwo, which is not a hybrid, costs about half as much as a hybrid in the US.

The unique design of the Smart has received much attention in the U.S. In its April 2008 issue, ''[[Men's Vogue]]'' raised the question: in a nation where your supersized car is your castle, is the Smart too mini for a man?<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensvogue.com/design/articles/2008/04/Smart |title="Smart: too mini for a man?" |publisher=mensvogue.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>

To obtain a Smart requires obtaining a "reservation" costing $99 through a dealer or over the internet. The waiting time in January 2009 was approximately 12 months, however as of July 2009 there was no wait to obtain a vehicle and dealers have them in stock for immediate delivery.

Smart offers the hardtop and convertible models of the [[Smart Fortwo|Fortwo]] coupé in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Smart.com/-snm-0156420588-1163148103-0000027350-0000007335-1165696450-enm-is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/mpc-mx-content-Site/-/-/-/SVCPresentationPipeline-Start?Page=issite%3a%2f%2fSmart-Site%2fSmart%2ecom%2fRootFolder%2fSmart%2fhome%2epage |title=Mexico homepage |publisher=Smart.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>

The Smart cars were first introduced to the country in 2003, and were sold in department stores [[Sanborns]] and [[Liverpool (store)|Liverpool]]. Later Mercedes Benz dealers started to offer the car ,which although very attractive to the public was considered very expensive and was seen as a toy car only for young people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Currently Smart cars are still offered in the country but with little acceptance, with only the Fortwo model available.

Smart cars have fierce competition with the [[Hyundai Atos]], [[Pontiac Matiz]], and [[Chevrolet Chevy]], which are compacts with low gas consumption at less than half the cost of a Smart Car but with more space for passengers.

==Smart in Australia==
Since 2003 Smart has been for sale in Australia. All Smart models that have been produced have been sold in Australia. The Smart is currently sold through Mercedes-Benz Dealerships. Recently Smart has become popular among young people in urban areas of Australia, particularly in its largest cities.

The main structure of the car is a stiff structure called a ''Tridion Safety Cell'', which is designed to activate the crumple zones of a colliding vehicle. This design creates a very strong safety cell around the passengers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.Smartusa.com/Smart-Fortwo-safety-design.aspx |title=Smart Fortwo safety design |accessdate=2008-04-26 }}</ref>

==Modification==
Smart cars have been modified by [[Brabus]] of Germany, resulting in Brabus production models.  Other companies modify the Smart to use motorcycle engines, such as the [[Suzuki Hayabusa]] 1340 cc inline four-cylinder.  These cars are known as Smartuki.  The most powerful models can accelerate from 0 to 60&nbsp;mph (0 to 100&nbsp;km/h) in less than 3.5 seconds. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Some companies and individuals upgrade the original engine to Brabus spec, but these have been taken even further by some with many aftermarket upgrade options available.

[[Project Kahn]] of [[Great Britain]] also modify the [[Smart ForTwo]].
