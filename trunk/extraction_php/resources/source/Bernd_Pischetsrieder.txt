'''Dr. Bernd Peter Pischetsrieder''' (born {{birth date and age|1948|02|15|df=yes}}) is a [[German people|German]] [[automobile]] engineer and manager.  

He was born in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], and studied Mechanical Engineering at the [[Technical University of Munich]] from 1968 to 1972.  He earned the degree of "[[Diplom-Ingenieur]]", and began his career at [[BMW]] in 1973 as a Production Planning Engineer.  He was promoted to become chairman of the board of BMW from 1993 through 1999.  He was also chairman of the [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen AG)]] from 2002 to 2006, and chairman of [[Scania (company)|Scania AB]] until 2007. 

During his time as head of BMW, Pischetsrieder was known for solidifying the company's position as a leader in the luxury car market with a solid sporting and engineering reputation.  His decision in 1994 to purchase [[Rover (car)|Rover Group]] from [[British Aerospace]] was widely regarded as a failure on paper. Although many of the assets were sold at vast profit and the purchase brought the valuable [[Mini]] and [[Land Rover]] marques into BMW ownership, the Rover passenger car operation drained the company's coffers.  Rover was sold off in 2000, with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] taking on Land Rover, and the revived Mini remaining at BMW.  A more notable achievement was the assumption of the [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] [[marque]], a deal which left rival [[Volkswagen Group]] manager, [[Ferdinand Piëch]], with only the [[Bentley]] marque, and the [[Crewe]] factory.

Late in 2000 Pischetrieder joined Volkswagen Group, mandated initially to take responsibility for quality, as "the voice of the customer" across the group, along with specific responsibility for giving the group's [[SEAT]] operation a new focus.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200025>{{cite journal|author=Bernd Ostmann (Ed)|title="Ich bin die Stimme des Kunden im Unternehman"|journal=[[Auto, Motor und Sport]]|volume=Heft 25 2000|pages=pp.208-210|date=date 29 November 2000}}</ref>  On 16 April 2002, Pischetsrieder succeeded Piëch as chairman of Volkswagen AG.  At Volkswagen, he directed [[Bugatti Automobiles|Bugatti Automobiles SAS]] to reengineer the [[Bugatti Veyron|Bugatti Veyron 16.4]], delaying an expected launch.  He continued moving the [[Audi]] and [[Volkswagen]] marques upmarket to some controversy.

He is known to be an enthusiastic driver, and once wrote off a silver [[McLaren F1]] exotic sports car.  There were only 64 street legal versions of the McLaren manufactured.

In a surprise announcement on 7 November 2006, it was revealed that Pischetsrieder would be stepping down from the top job at Volkswagen AG on 31 December that year.  He was to be replaced by [[Martin Winterkorn|Dr. Martin Winterkorn]], who was head of the Audi division.
