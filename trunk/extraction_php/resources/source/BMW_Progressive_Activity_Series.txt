A progressive activity vehicle series is a marketing description by [[BMW]] to describe a car which combines the looks and functions of a sedan, an [[SUV]], and a classic [[Gran Turismo (automobile)|Gran Turismo]]. The [[BMW Concept 5 Series Gran Turismo]] was the first production-destined rendition of the progressive activity vehicle development idea, classified as a progressive activity sedan (PAS). 

This name is derived from BMW's [[BMW Sports Activity Series|Sports Activity Series]] of [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] [[sport utility vehicle]]s 

==Introduction==
On January 30, 2009 [[BMW]] released a marketing video through their BMWwebTV Online Group called "BMW Concept: Scribble Video". The video was the first public introduction into the thought process behind the design of the progressive activity vehicle series. BMW claimed "It is not a sedan, no SUV and no station-wagon, but 100% BMW." <ref>[http://www.bmwusa.com/standard/content/experience/newsfeed/post/2009/01/29/BMW-Concept-Scribble-Video.aspx BMW Concept: Scribble Video link at BMW USA]</ref>

==Progressive activity sedan (PAS)==
The PAS concept was debuted at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show with the [[BMW Concept 5 Series Gran Turismo|Concept 5 Series Gran Turismo (5 GT)]]. The first generation of PAS vehicles will be based on the [[BMW F7|F7]] automobile platform. The PAS line of vehicles provides the customer a vehicle length traditionally found in a [[BMW]] 7 series, but with the headroom found in a [[BMW X5]].<ref>[http://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/us02.nsf/fwPressemeldungFrame?readform&docid=799C8B36C8B493A2C125755C0001C92F Press Release: BMW Concept 5 Series Gran Turismo at the 20009 Geneva Motor Show]</ref> The PAS also features a unique "bi-modal" trunk which may be opened in a traditional car like fashion, or the entire hatch may be open in a traditional [[SUV]]/[[minivan]]/[[station wagon]] fashion for larger objects.

==Progressive activity coupe (PAC)==
The PAC is meant to appeal to BMW customers looking for a smaller sportier version of the PAS. The PAC is expected to have a higher roof in comparison to a standard [[BMW 3 Series|3 series]] wagon, a longer wheelbase, and optional four-wheel drive over the standard rear wheel drive. The first generation of PAS vehicles will be based on the [[BMW V3|V3]] automobile platform, and is expected to debut as the Concept 3 Series Gran Turismo (3 GT) at the upcoming 2009 Frankfurt Autoshow.
