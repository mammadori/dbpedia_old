'''Edelsbrunner Automobile München''' was a small Bavarian car company based in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. 

At the beginning of 1990 the company began producing a small series of two cars in the style of the thirties. Inspired by legendary driver [[Tazio Nuvolari]], the first Roadster was the [[EAM Nuvolari S1]]. In the presence of the sister and other relatives of Tazio Nuvolari, the Nuvolari S1 was formally presented and introduced to the public. 

Unfortunately the German market at that time was very small and these cars were not successful.

There were two types:

*[[EAM_Nuvolari_S1]]
*[[EAM Nuvolari R1]]

The Nuvolari S1 was only produced in small numbers and the R1 model R1 did not get beyond a prototype.
