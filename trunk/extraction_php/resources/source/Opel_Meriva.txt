The '''Opel Meriva''' is a [[mini MPV]] based on the platform of the third generation [[Opel Corsa]] and sold under that name on all of the [[Europe]]an markets with the exception of the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it is called the '''[[Vauxhall Motors| Vauxhall Meriva]]'''. It is also sold in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina under the [[Chevrolet]] marque. It is built in [[São Caetano do Sul]], [[Brazil]] by [[General Motors do Brasil]] and in [[Figueruelas, Spain]], by Opel. It first appeared in late 2002.

The Meriva is available with [[petrol engine|petrol]] and [[turbodiesel]] engines ranging from 1.3&nbsp;L to 1.8&nbsp;L, with power going from 70&nbsp;PS (51&nbsp;kW) to 125&nbsp;PS (92&nbsp;kW). The base model is also available with an [[Easytronic]] automated sequential manual transmission.

In [[Argentina]] there are several versions available:
* GL 1.8&nbsp;L 8V, base model, [[air conditioning]].
* GL Plus 1.8&nbsp;L 8V, (GL with [[anti-lock braking system]])
* GL Plus 1.8&nbsp;L 8V, with [[airbags]]
* GLS (top of the line) 1.8&nbsp;L 16V, ABS, [[Electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]], front airbags, special rims, Flex5.
* GLS Turbo Diesel 1.7&nbsp;L
* GLS Turbo Diesel 1.8&nbsp;L
* [[Easytronic]] 1.8&nbsp;L 8V, [[air conditioning]], ABS, front airbags, Flex5.

Like its bigger sibling, the [[Opel Zafira|Zafira]], the Meriva has a flexible interior, named FlexSpace. Although it only has five seats in two rows, the second row can be moved forward and backwards, or pushed into the floor, making a straight platform for increased boot space. The second row can accommodate two or three passengers. In the two-passenger mode, the seats are separated from the doors and from each other much like the front seats. In three-passenger mode the back seat looks like a regular one piece seat. The front seat can be pushed fully backwards while the rear passengers can still get more than a decent amount of leg room. It has a generous [[trunk (automobile)|trunk]] that can be further extended pushing the back seats into the floor.

==The Next Meriva==
  
A concept car named "Meriva Concept" was presented at the 2008 [[Geneva Motor Show]], showing the styling direction that the 2nd generation will take, including the [[suicide doors]], a first for the mini-mpv category. The all new Meriva will debut at the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]], with it going into production sometime in 2010.
