'''Nelson Algren''' ([[March 28]], [[1909]] &ndash; [[May 9]], [[1981]]) was an [[United States|American]] writer.

==Early life==
Algren was born '''Nelson Ahlgren Abraham''' in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. At the age of three he moved with his parents to [[Chicago, Illinois]] where they lived in a working-class, immigrant neighborhood on the [[Neighborhoods of Chicago#South side|South Side]].  His father was the son of a Swedish convert to [[Judaism]] and a [[Jewish American]] woman, as his mother (who owned a candy store) was of [[Germany|German]] [[Jewish]] descent.  When Algren was eight years old, his parents moved from 7139 S. South Park Avenue (now S. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) in the far South Side neighborhood of St. Columbanus to an apartment in the [[Albany Park, Chicago|Albany Park]] neighborhood on the North Side. Algren's father worked as an auto mechanic nearby on North Kedzie Avenue.  

Algren was educated in Chicago's [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], graduated from Hibbard High School (now Roosevelt), and went on to study at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[journalism]] during the [[Great Depression]] in 1931.

==Career==
He wrote his first story, ''So Help Me'', in 1933, while he was in Texas working at a gas station.  Before returning home, he was caught stealing a typewriter from an abandoned classroom. For this, he spent nearly five months behind bars and faced a possible three additional years in jail. Fortunately for Algren, he was released, but the incident made a deep impression on him. It deepened his identification with outsiders, has-beens, and the general failures who later populated his fictional world.

His first novel, ''Somebody in Boots'', was published in 1935. ''Never Come Morning'', published in 1942, portrayed the dead-end life of a doomed young criminal.

Algren served as a private in the [[European Theater]] of [[World War II|WWII]] as a litter bearer. Despite being a college graduate, he was denied entry into Officer Candidate School. There is conjecture that this may have been due to suspicion regarding Algren's political beliefs, although in any event his criminal conviction would have most likely excluded him from OSC.

He articulated the world of "drunks, pimps, prostitutes, freaks, drug addicts, prize fighters, corrupt politicians, and hoodlums". [[Art Shay]] wrote years later about how Algren had written a poem from the perspective of a 'halfy', street slang for a legless man on wheels.<ref name="ShayP118"/> The protagonist  talks about "how forty wheels rolled over his legs and how he was ready to strap up and give death a wrestle".<ref name="ShayP118"/> [[Art Shay|Shay]] wrote that Algren later commented that this poem was probably key to everything he had ever written.<ref name="ShayP118"/>   

He is probably best known for his [[1950 in literature|1950]] [[National Book Award]] winning ''[[The Man With the Golden Arm (novel)|The Man With the Golden Arm]]''. His next book, ''[[Chicago, City on the Make]]'' (1951), was a scathing essay that outraged the city's boosters but beautifully presented the back alleys of the town, its dispossessed, its corrupt politicians and its swindlers. 

In the fall of 1955, Algren was interviewed for the ''[[Paris Review]]'' by rising author [[Terry Southern]]. Algren and Southern became friends through this meeting and remained in touch for many years. Algren became one of Southern's most enthusiastic early supporters, and when he taught creative writing in later years he often used Southern as an example of a great short story writer.<ref>Hill, Lee - ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern'' (Bloomsbury, 2001), pp.63-64</ref>

In 1975, Algren was commissioned to write a magazine article about the trial of [[Rubin "Hurricane" Carter]], the prize fighter who had been found guilty of double murder. While researching the article Algren visited Carter's hometown of [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. Algren was instantly fascinated by the city of Paterson and he immediately decided to move there. In the summer of 1975 Algren sold off most of his belongings, left Chicago, and moved into an apartment in Paterson.  

In 1980, Algren moved into a house on Long Island, in New York state. He died of a heart attack the following year. 

The article about Carter had grown into a novel, ''The Devil's Stocking'', which was published posthumuously in 1983.<ref> [http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/nalgren.htm Nelson Algren Biography], Nelson Algren Biography. [[November 20]], [[2006]]. </ref>

In 1994 the book ''[[Nonconformity]]'' was published, presenting Algren's view of the difficulties surrounding the 1956 film adaptation of ''The Man With the Golden Arm''. ''Nonconformity'' also presents the belief system behind Algren's writing, and a call to writers everywhere to investigate the dark and represent the ignored.

Nelson was also honored in 1998 with a fountain dedicated in his name<ref>[http://www.pbcchicago.com/subhtml/project_detail.asp?txtPRJ_ID=FP-04 ]</ref> located in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago's]] [[Polish Triangle]], in what had been the heart of [[Polish Downtown]], the area that figured as the inspiration for much of his work. Appropriately enough, [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]], Algren's favorite street as well as the onetime ''Polish Broadway'' runs right past it.<ref name="ShayP118"/>

In 2009, the novel fragment ''Entrapment'' was published along with other unpublished Algren fiction and reportage as ''Entrapment and Other Writings'' by [[Seven Stories Press]].

==Personal life==
Algren had an affair with [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and they travelled to [[Latin America]] together in 1949.  In her novel ''The Mandarins'' (1957), she wrote of Algren (who is "Lewis Brogan" in the book):

<blockquote>At first I found it amusing meeting in the flesh that classic American species: self-made leftist writer.  Now, I began taking an interest in Brogan.  Through his stories, you got the feeling that he claimed no rights to life and that nevertheless he had always had a passionate desire to live.  I liked that mixture of modesty and eagerness.</blockquote>

== FBI surveillance ==
According to [[Herbert Mitgang]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] suspected Algren's political views and kept a dossier on him amounting to more than 500 pages, but identified nothing concretely subversive.<ref>Mitgang, Herbert, ''Dangerous Dossiers: Exposing the Secret War Against America's Greatest Authors'', NY: Donald I. Fine, Inc. 1988</ref>

== Algren and Chicago Polonia ==
Algren described [[Ashland Avenue]] as figuratively connecting Chicago to [[Warsaw]] in Poland.<ref name="ShayP118">Shay, Art. ''Nelson Algren's Chicago'', University of Illinois Press 1988, p. 118</ref> His own life involved [[Poles in Chicago|the Polish community of Chicago]] in many ways, including his Polish second wife Amanda Kontowicz. His friend [[Art Shay]] wrote about Algren,  while gambling, listening to old Polish love songs sung by an elderly waitress.<ref name="ShayP119">Shay, p. 119</ref> The city's [[Polish Downtown (Chicago)|Polish Downtown]], where he lived for years, played a significant part in his literary output. Polish bars that Algren frequented in his gambling, such as the Bit of Poland on [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenue]], figured in such writings as ''[[Never Come Morning]]'' and ''The Man With the Golden Arm''.<ref name="ShayP118"/>

His novel ''Never Come Morning'' was published several years after the [[invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], a period when Poles, like Jews, were labeled as inferior as a [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] by [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]].<ref name=ChiReader>[https://securesite.chireader.com/cgi-bin/Archive/abridged2.bat?path=1998/981120/ALGREN&search=%22polish%20triangle%22 Jeff Huebner, "Full Nelson"], ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', November 20, 1998</ref> Chicago's [[Polish-American]] leaders thought ''[[Never Come Morning]]'' played on these [[anti-polonism|anti-Polish stereotypes]], and launched a sustained campaign against the book through the Polish press, the [[Polish Roman Catholic Union of America]], and other [[Polish-American]] institutions.<ref name=ChiReader/> A flood{{Vague|date=September 2008}} of articles appeared in the local Polish newspapers, and letters were sent to Mayor [[Edward Joseph Kelly|Ed Kelly]], the [[Chicago Public Library]], and Algren's publisher, [[Harper & Brothers]].<ref name=ChiReader/>  The general tone of the campaign is suggested by a ''Zgoda'' editorial that attacked his character and mental state, saw readers who got free copies as victims of a Nazi-financed plot, and said the novel proved a deep desire to harm ethnic Poles on Algren's part.<ref name=ChiReader/> The [[Polish American Council]] sent a copy of a resolution condemning the novel to the [[FBI]].<ref name=ChiReader/> Algren and his publisher defended against these accusations, with the author telling a library meeting that the book was about the effects of poverty, regardless of national background.<ref name=ChiReader/>  The mayor had the novel removed from the [[Chicago Public Library]] system, and it apparently remained absent for at least 20 years.<ref name=ChiReader/>

At least two later efforts to commemorate Algren in [[Polish Downtown]] echoed the attacks on the novels.
 
Shortly after his death in 1981, his last Chicago residence at 1958 West Evergreen Street was taken note of by Chicago journalist [[Mike Royko]]. The walk-up apartment just east of Damen Avenue in the former Polish Downtown neighborhood of [[West Town]] was in an area that had been dominated by Polish immigrants and was once one of Chicago's toughest and most crowded neighborhoods.  The renaming of Evergreen Street to Algren Street caused controversy, and was almost immediately reversed.<ref>Lévy, Bernard-Henri. [http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200505/levy In the Footsteps of Tocqueville], ''The Atlantic Monthly'', May 2005</ref> 

In 1998, Algren enthusiasts instigated the renaming after Algren the [[Polish Triangle]] in what had been the center of the [[Polish Downtown]]. Replacing the plaza's traditional name, the director of the [[Polish Museum of America]] predicted, would obliterate the history of [[Poles in Chicago|Chicago ethnic Poles]], and insult ethnic Polish institutions and local businesses.<ref name=ChiReader/> In the end a compromise was reached where the Triangle kept its older name and a newly installed fountain was named after Algren and inscribed, circling the fountain's base, with a quotation about the city's working people protecting its essence, from Algren's essay "[[Chicago: City on the Make]]".<ref name=ChiReader/>

In the (fictional) book, as a period of unrest within the prison begins, the character 'Kenyatta' gives a speech closely mirroring the Fortean Times transcript of the 1977 hoax, and those of other American newspaper reports of the broadcast. The passage in Algren's book says:

::<blockquote>"I am an authorized representative of the Intergalactic Mission," Kenyatta finally disclosed his credentials. "I have a message for the Planet Earth. We are beginning to enter the period of Aquarius. Many corrections have to be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be destroyed. You have only a short time to learn to live together in peace. You must live in peace" - here he paused to gain everybody's attention - "you must live in peace or leave the galaxy!"      <ref>{{cite book

*In the 1975 [[Jerry Kamstra]] book ''[[The Frisco Kid (novel)|The Frisco Kid]]'', Jerry's mentally challenged friend Scott pulls him aside and forces Jerry to promise to him that he will read Nelson Algren because "he is the one American author that hasn't sold out yet, kid."
*In his [[1967 in literature|1967]] novella, ''[[Trout Fishing in America]]'', [[Richard Brautigan]] writes about crating up and mailing a crippled wino (Trout Fishing in America Shorty) to Nelson Algren.
*[[Leonard Cohen]] used images from ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' in "The Stranger Song," from his first album, ''[[Songs of Leonard Cohen]]'' (1967): "you've seen that man before: his golden arm dispatching cards, but now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger".
*In the documentary ''Classic Albums: Lou Reed: Transformer'', musician [[Lou Reed]] says that Algren's [[1956 in literature|1956]] novel, ''[[A Walk on the Wild Side (novel)|A Walk on the Wild Side]]'', was the launching point for his [[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|song of the same name]]. 
*The 2002 album ''Adult World'' by guitarist [[Wayne Kramer]] (founding member of the Detroit band [[MC5]]) contains a song entitled ''Nelson Algren Stopped By'', in which guest band X-Mars-X provides a shuffling jazz background while Kramer reads a prose poem about walking the streets of present-day Chicago with Algren.
*The Minnesota based punk-rock band [[Dillinger Four]] quotes Algren as an inspiration in the song ''Doublewhiskeycokenoice'' from their album ''[[Midwestern Songs of the Americas]]''. In that song Patrick Costello sings "Nelson Algren came to me and said, 'Celebrate the ugly things' / The beat-up side of what they call pride could be the measure of these days."
*"Pimp" is a song on The Tubes second album, ''[[Young and Rich]]''. According to the original liner notes, ''A Walk on the Wild Side'' was an inspiration.
*In 2005 [[The Hold Steady]] mentioned Algren in the song ''Chicago Seemed Tired Last Night'' from the ''[[Separation Sunday]]'' album. The first line of the song is "Nelson Algren came to Paddy at some party at the Dead End Alley/He told him what to celebrate" and towards the end the song goes "Hey Nelson Algren. Chicago seemed tired last nite/They had cigarettes where there were supposed to be eyes." The name "Paddy" in the song is a reference to Patrick Costello and the "Dead End Alley" is the name of the house where the [[Dillinger Four]]'s members used to live.
*In 2005 an alternative rock band named "Algren" formed in Chicago, IL inspired by the life of the author and his conflicted relationship with the city.

== Nelson Algren Award ==
Each year the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper gives a Nelson Algren award for short fiction. Winners are published in the newspaper and given $5,000. The award is viewed with more than a little irony by Algren admirers; the Tribune panned Algren's work in his lifetime, referring to ''[[Chicago: City on the Make]]'' as a "highly scented object." In an afterword to that book, Algren accused the Tribune of imposing false viewpoints on the city and promoting mediocrity.

Studs Terkel, writer Warren Leming, and three others founded the Nelson Algren Committee in 1989. At the time all of Algren's work was out of print. All of it is now back in print. The Committee awards community activists an annual Algren award, and sponsors an  Algren Birthday party. Leming's song ''Algren Street'' can be downloaded from the Committee's [http://www.nelsonalgren.org website]. The site also contains the short film ''Algren's Last Night'', written by Leming and directed by Carmine Cervi.
