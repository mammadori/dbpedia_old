The '''Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft (VAG)''', also known as '''Volkswagen Group''' or as '''VW''', is an [[automobile]] manufacturer and mobility organisation based in [[Wolfsburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]] and is the pioneer brand within the [[Volkswagen Group]], which contains the car brands [[Audi AG]], [[Bentley]] Motors Limited, [[Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S.]], Automobili [[Lamborghini]] S.p.A, [[SEAT]], [[Škoda Auto]] and heavy goods vehicle manufacturer [[Scania AB]].  The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft (VAG) has endorsed the creation of an integrated automotive group with Porsche under the leadership of Volkswagen.

Volkswagen means "people's car" in [[German language|German]], in which it is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈfɔlksˌvaːɡən|}}.  Its current [[tagline]] or [[Advertising slogan|slogan]] is ''[[Das Auto]]'' (in English ''The Car'').  Its previous German tagline was ''Aus Liebe zum Automobil'', which translates to: ''Out of Love for the Car'', or, ''For Love of the Automobile'', as translated by VW in other languages.

In November 2009, Volkswagen-Porsche overtook [[Toyota]] to become the world's largest car manufacturer in terms of production, as the German group benefits from state-backed stimulus packages around the world.<ref>"Volkswagen Steals Toyota's Crown as World's Largest Automaker" http://autos.yahoo.com/articles/autos_content_landing_pages/1161/volkswagen-steals-toyotas-crown-as-worlds-largest-automaker/</ref>

[[Image:Porsche Typ12 Model Nuremberg crop.jpg|thumb|Model of [[Porsche]] Type 12 (Zündapp), Museum of Industrial Culture, [[Nuremberg]]]]
In the early 1930s German auto industry was still largely composed of luxury models, and the average German rarely could afford something more than a motorcycle. Seeking a potential new market, some auto industries begun independent projects of a "Volks Auto" (people's automobile) - Mercedes' 170H, Adler's AutoBahn, Steyr 55, Hanomag 1,3L, among others. 
The trend was not new, as [[Béla Barényi]] is credited with having conceived the basic design in the middle 1920's. Joseph Ganz developed the Standard Superior (going as far as advertising it as the "German Volkswagen").<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Elan |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1251804553863&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |title=Was Hitler's Beetle designed by a Jew? &#124; Jewish Features &#124; Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref> Also, in Czechoslovakia, the [[Hans Ledwinka]]'s penned Tatra 77, a very popular car amongst the German elite, was becoming smaller and more affordable at each revision. 
In 1933, with many of the above projects still in development or early stages of production, [[Adolf Hitler]] declared his intentions for a state-sponsored "Volkswagen" program. Hitler required a basic vehicle capable of transporting two adults and three children at {{convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.  The "People's Car" would be available to citizens of the [[Third Reich]] through a savings scheme at 990 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]], about the price of a small [[motorcycle]] (an average income being around 32RM a week).<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.lasteditionbeetle.com/history.php Volkswagen Beetle History 1938 to 2003 (abridged)]</ref>

Despite heavy lobbing in favor of one of the existing projects, Hitler choose to sponsor an all new, state owned factory. The engineer chosen for the task was Ferdinand Porsche. By then an already famed engineer, Porsche was the designer of the Mercedes 170H, and worked at Steyr for quite some time in the late 1920s. When he opened his own design studio he landed two separate "Auto für Jedermann" (car for everybody) projects with NSU and Zündapp, both motorcycle manufacturers. Neither project come to fruition, stalling at prototype phase, but the basic concept remained in Porsche's mind time enough, so on 22 June 1934, Dr. Ferdinand Porsche agreed to create the "People's Car" for Hitler. 

Changes included better [[fuel efficiency]], reliability, ease of use, and economically efficient repairs and parts.  The intention was that ordinary Europeans would buy the car by means of a savings scheme (''"{{lang|de|Fünf Mark die Woche musst Du sparen, willst Du im eigenen Wagen fahren}}" — "Save five Marks a week, if you want to drive your own car"''), which around 336,000 people eventually paid into.  Volkswagen honoured its savings agreements in [[West Germany]] (but not in [[East Germany]]) after [[World War II]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}.  Prototypes of the car called the "KdF-Wagen" (German: ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]'' — "strength through joy"), appeared from 1936 onwards (the first cars had been produced in [[Stuttgart]]).  The car already had its distinctive round shape and [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]], [[Flat-4|flat-four]], [[Rear-engine design|rear-mounted engine]].  The VW car was just one of many [[Strength Through Joy|KdF]] programmes which included things such as tours and outings.  The prefix ''Volks—'' ("People's") was not just applied to cars, but also to other products in Europe; the "[[Volksempfänger]]" radio receiver for instance.  On 28 May 1937, the ''Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH'' was established by the ''[[Deutsche Arbeitsfront]]''. It was later renamed "Volkswagenwerk GmbH" on 16 September 1938.

[[Image:VW Typ 83 vr.jpg|thumb|VW Type 82E]]
[[Erwin Komenda]], the longstanding [[Auto Union]] chief designer, developed the car body of the prototype, which was recognizably the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] known today.  It was one of the first to be evolved with the aid of a [[wind tunnel]], in use in Germany since the early 1920s.

The building of the new factory started 26 May 1938 in the new town of KdF-Stadt, now called [[Wolfsburg]], which had been purpose-built for the factory workers. This factory had only produced a handful of cars by the time war started in 1939.  None was actually delivered to any holder of the completed saving stamp books, though one Type 1 Cabriolet was presented to Hitler on 20 April 1938 (his 49th birthday).

War meant production changed to military vehicles, the Type 82 ''[[Volkswagen Kübelwagen|Kübelwagen]]'' ("Tub car") utility vehicle (VW's most common wartime model), and the [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] ''[[Volkswagen Schwimmwagen|Schwimmwagen]]'' which were used to equip the German forces.<!-- There is an unreasonably large gap in the history here from April 1938 until April 1945.  With the amount of detail given both before April 1938 and after April 1945, this omission should at least be noted, if not fully fleshed out. -->
[[Image:VW Wolfsburg.JPG|thumb|Volkswagen factory with its own power plant]]

===1945: British Army, Major Ivan Hirst, unclear future===
The company owes its [[post-war]] existence largely to one man, [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] [[Major]] [[Ivan Hirst]], [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|REME]].  In April 1945, KdF-Stadt, and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the [[United States|Americans]], and subsequently handed over to the [[United Kingdom|British]], within whose [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zone]] the town and factory fell.  The factories were placed under the control of [[Oldham]]-born Hirst.  At first, the plan was to use it for [[List of military vehicles|military vehicle]] maintenance.  Since it had been used for military production, and had been in Hirst's words a "political animal" rather than a commercial enterprise, the equipment was in time intended to be salvaged as [[war reparations]].  Hirst painted one of the factory's cars green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters.  Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000.  The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to the German Post Office.

Some British [[Soldier|Service personnel]] were allowed to take their [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]]s back to the [[United Kingdom]] when they were [[Demobilization|demobilized]], and one of the very first Beetles brought back in that way (UK registration number JLT 420) is still owned by Peter Colborne-Baber, the son of the original proprietor of the UK's first official Volkswagen Importer, Colborne Garages of [[Ripley, Surrey]].<ref>{{cite web

By 1946 the factory was producing 1,000 cars a month, a remarkable feat considering it was still in disrepair.  Owing to roof and window damage, rain stopped production and new vehicles were bartered for steel required for more production.

The car, and its town changed their Second World War-era names to "Volkswagen", and "[[Wolfsburg]]" respectively, and production was increasing.  It was still unclear what was to become of the factory.  It was offered to representatives from the British, American and French motor industries.  Famously, all rejected it.  After an inspection of the plant, [[William Edward Rootes, 1st Baron Rootes|Sir William Rootes]], head of the British [[Rootes Group]], told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car "is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy … If you think you're going to build cars in this place, you're a bloody fool, young man". {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In an ironic twist of fate, Volkswagen would manufacture a locally built version of Rootes's [[Hillman Avenger]] in [[Argentina]] in the 1980s, long after Rootes had gone bankrupt at the hands of [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] in 1978—the Beetle outliving the Avenger by over 30 years.
	
Ford representatives were equally critical: the car was "not worth a damn," according to [[Henry Ford II]], the son of [[Edsel Ford]], although he did reportedly look at the possibility of taking over the VW factory, but dismissed the idea as soon as he looked up Wolfsburg on the map and found it to be too close for comfort to the East German border.
	
In [[France]], [[Citroën]] started the [[Citroën 2CV|2CV]] on a similar marketing concept.  Meanwhile, in [[Italy]], the [[Fiat 500]] "Topolino" was developed.

===Survival in Allied occupied Germany===
In [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Occupied Germany]], the Allies followed the [[Morgenthau Plan]], to remove all German war potential, by complete or partial [[Pastoralism|pastoralisation]].  As part of this, in the [[Industrial plans for Germany]], the rules for which industry Germany was to be allowed to retain were set out.  German car production was set at a maximum of 10% of the 1936 car production numbers.<ref>[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&documentid=22&documentdate=1947-03-24&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK Harry S. Truman - Library & Museum - Draft, The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, Report 3, March, 1947; OF 950B: Economic Mission as to Food…; Truman Papers]</ref>

As mentioned above, the Volkswagen factory at [[Wolfsburg]] came under British control in 1945; it was to be dismantled and shipped to Britain.  Thankfully for Volkswagen, no British car manufacturer was interested in the factory; "the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car … it is quite unattractive to the average buyer … To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2000/mar/18/guardianobituaries The Guardian - Obituaries - Ivan Hirst]</ref>  The factory survived by producing cars for the [[British Army]] instead.  Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid 1947, although heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.  In March 1947 [[Herbert Hoover]] helped change policy by stating: "There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the [[Oder-Neisse line|annexations]] can be reduced to a 'pastoral state'.  It cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25,000,000 people out of it".<ref>[http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2008/webarticles/080103_marshallplan.html UN Chronicle, The Marshall Plan at 60: The General's Successful War On Poverty]</ref>  Thanks to the protection of British Army Major [[Ivan Hirst]], Volkswagen survived the perilous times, and became part of the German economic recovery.

From 1948, Volkswagen became a very important element, symbolically and economically, of [[West Germany|West German]] regeneration.  [[Heinrich Nordhoff]] (1899–1968), a former senior manager at [[Opel]] who had overseen civilian and military vehicle production in the 1930s and 1940s, was recruited to run the factory in 1948.  In 1949 Major Hirst left association with the company, as it had now been re-formed as a trust, controlled by the West German government, and the government of the State of [[Lower Saxony]].  Apart from the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Type 2]] [[commercial vehicle]] (van, pickup and camper), and the [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|VW Karmann Ghia]] sports car, Nordhoff pursued the one-model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.

Volkswagens were first exhibited and sold in the [[United States]] in 1949, but only sold two units in America that first year.  On its entry to the U.S. market, the VW was briefly sold as a "Victory Wagon".  [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] was formed in April 1955 to standardize sales and service in the [[United States]].  Production of the Type 1 [[Volkswagen Beetle]] increased dramatically over the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.

Volkswagens in Canada - VW Canada ordered their first cars on July 10, 1952. (shipping order 143075) The order consisted of 12 vehicles, (3) model 11C, a black, green and sandcolour (3) 11GS, a chestnut brown and two azure blue, (2) 24A-M51 in red, (1)21A in blue, (1) 23A in blue, (1) 22A beige colour, and one Ambulance. Volkswagen Products were seen in Canada for the first time at the Canadian National Exhibition in August 1952 and were accepted enthusiastically. The first shipment of cars reached Toronto in December 1952. By 1955 sales were on a basis that warranted the building of the fine Volkswagen plant on a 32&nbsp;acre site on Scarboro's Golden Mile. To this, a 60,000 square foot building with administration, showrooms, service, repairs and parts, an addition of 60,000 feet was built in 1957, with storage for $4,000,000 of parts. 
(see 1959 Canadian Register of Commerce & Industry held in the Western Libraries at the University of Western Ontario)

Sales soared — thanks in part to the famous advertising campaigns by New York advertising agency [[DDB Worldwide|Doyle, Dane Bernbach]].  Led by art director Helmut Krone, and copywriters [[Julian Koenig]] and Bob Levinson, Volkswagen advertisements became as popular as the car, using crisp layouts and witty copy to lure the younger, sophisticated consumers with whom the car became associated.  Even though it was almost universally known as the Beetle (or the Bug), it was never officially labeled as such by the manufacturer, instead referred to as the Type 1.  The first reference to the name Beetle occurred in U.S. advertising in 1968, but not until 1998 and the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]]-based [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]] would the name be adopted by Volkswagen.

Although the car was becoming outdated, during the 1960s and early 1970s, American exports, innovative [[advertising]], and a growing reputation for reliability helped production figures surpass the levels of the previous record holder, the [[Ford Model T]].  On February 17, 1972 the 15,007,034th Beetle was sold. Volkswagen could now claim the world production record for the most-produced, single make of car in history.  By 1973, total production was over 16 million.

To commemorate its passing the Ford Model T's record sales mark and its victories in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the "Baja Champion SE"<ref>[http://www.sebeetles.com/champion.htm Baja Champion SE]</ref> in the United States and the "Marathon" Superbeetle in the rest of the world.  It featured unique "Marathon Blau" metallic blue paint, steel-pressed 10-spoke 15-inch (38&nbsp;cm) magnesium-alloy wheels, a commemorative metal plate mounted on the glovebox and a certificate of authenticity presented to the original purchaser.  Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper overriders, tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (behind the steering wheel and the glovebox cover) as well as [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] fog lights mounted on the front bumper.

===Product line expansion===
[[Image:212310.jpg|thumb|left|An original and unmodified 1963 [[Volkswagen Type 3|VW Type 3 Notchback]].]]
VW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of several [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3]] models, which were essentially body style variations (Fastback, Notchback, Squareback) based on Type 1 mechanical underpinnings, and again in 1969 with the larger [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4]] (also known as the 411 and 412) models.  These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of [[monocoque|monocoque/unibody]] construction, the option of a fully [[automatic transmission]], electronic [[fuel injection]], and a sturdier powerplant.  Volkswagen added a "Super Beetle"<ref>[http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm History of the Super Beetle]</ref> (the Type 113) to its lineup in 1971.  The Type 113 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a [[MacPherson strut]] front [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] instead of the usual [[Torsion beam suspension|torsion bars]].  Also the nose of the car was stretched {{convert|2|in|mm}} to allow the spare tyre to lie flat, and the combination of these two features significantly increased the usable front luggage space.  Despite the Super Beetle's (marketed outside North America as the VW 1302, later 1303) popularity with Volkswagen customers, purists preferred the standard Beetle with its less pronounced nose and its original torsion bar suspension.  In 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed [[Volkswagen 181|Type 181]], or "Trekker" in [[Europe]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "Thing" in America, recalling the wartime Type 81.  The military version was produced for the [[NATO]]-era [[German Army]] during the [[Cold War]] years of 1970 to 1979.  The US Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974, thanks at least in part to [[Ralph Nader]]'s automobile safety campaigns.

In 1964, Volkswagen succeeded in purchasing [[Auto Union]], and in 1969, [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]] (NSU).  The former company owned the historic [[Audi]] brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War.  VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern day Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its [[luxury vehicle]] [[marque]].  However, the purchase of Auto Union and NSU proved to be a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into terminal decline as the 1970s dawned.

===1974: from Beetle to Golf/Rabbit===
Volkswagen was in serious trouble by 1973.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1038/is_n6_v35/ai_13246858 Volkswagen's American assembly plant: fahrvergnugen was not enough - international marketing | Business Horizons | Find Articles at BNET<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Type 3 and Type 4 models had sold in much smaller numbers than the Beetle and the [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]]-based K70 also failed to woo buyers.  Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets.  The company knew that Beetle production had to end one day, but the conundrum of replacing it had been a never-ending nightmare.  VW's ownership of [[Audi]] / [[Auto Union]] proved to be the key to the problem - with its expertise in [[front-wheel drive]], and [[Water cooling|water-cooled]] engines which Volkswagen so desperately needed to produce a credible Beetle successor.  Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens, known as the Polo, Golf and Passat.

The [[Volkswagen Polo]] was in fact simply a re-badging of the short-lived [[Audi 50]], which had been hastily developed from a sedan design, the [[Audi F103|Audi 60]].  However, VW produced it shortly after the introduction of the Polo as the [[Volkswagen Derby]].  In the rear of the car can plainly be seen that panels are added to the Polo structure to make a "three-box" design of saloon (sedan), or saloon with a boot or trunk.

The [[Volkswagen Passat]] (Dasher in the U.S.), introduced in 1973, was again simply a [[fastback]] (available as either a hatchback or with separate boot) version of the [[Audi 80]], using identical body and mechanical parts, and the Audi 80 was later produced on the same line in Wolfsburg as the Passat.  Estate/wagon versions were offered for overseas markets, however, for two years, if British and South African customers wanted an estate/wagon version, they had to go considerably upmarket and buy the Audi 80 GL estate.

However, the pivotal model which would turn Volkswagen's fortunes emerged as the [[Volkswagen Golf]] in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975-1985) and 5th generation (2006-2009).  This was a car unlike its predecessor in most significant ways, both mechanically as well as visually (its angular styling was designed by the Italian [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]).  Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 [[Mini]] — the Golf had a [[Transverse engine|transversely mounted]], water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a [[hatchback]], a format that has dominated the market segment ever since.  Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction, but continued in smaller numbers at other German factories ([[Hanover]] and [[Emden]]) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]].

===Volkswagen from 1974 to 1990===
[[Image:Volkswagen polo 1990.jpg|thumb|right|Volkswagen Polo, 1990]]
While Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large [[Europe]]an automakers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen lineup since its introduction, and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company.  There have been six generations of the [[Volkswagen Golf]], the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the end of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America).  Its chassis also spawned the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] sport [[coupe]], [[Volkswagen Jetta]] saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] convertible, and [[Volkswagen Caddy]] pickup.  North American production of the Rabbit commenced at a factory in [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984.  The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from late 1983 to late 1991, and a North American version produced in [[Pennsylvania]] went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in [[South Africa]] as the [[Citi Golf]], with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.

In the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. The Japanese and the Americans were able to compete with similar products at lower prices.  Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.<ref>Flammang, James, ''Volkswagen: Beetles, Buses and Beyond,'' Krause Publications, 1996</ref>  The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America.  [[Motor Trend]] named the GTI its Car of the Year for 1985, and Volkswagen rose in the J.D. Power buyer satisfaction ratings to eighth place in 1985, up from 22nd a year earlier.<ref>Kiley, David, ''Getting the Bugs Out: The Rise, Fall and Comeback of Volkswagen in America,'' John Wiley & Sons, 2001</ref>  VW's American sales broke 200,000 in 1985 and 1986 before resuming the downward trend from earlier in the decade.  Chairman [[Carl Hahn]] decided to expand the company elsewhere, and the New Stanton, Pennsylvania factory closed on 14 July 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D6113DF932A15752C1A961948260 |title= Volkswagen to Shut U.S. Plant |accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref> Meanwhile, four years after signing a cooperation agreement with the Spanish car maker [[SEAT]] in 1982, Hahn expanded the company by purchasing a majority share of [[SEAT]] up to 75% by the end of 1986, which VW bought outright in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.seat.com/en/company/368-seat-hoy.html |title= A look at SEAT's time line 2008-1950 }}</ref>

Volkswagen had entered the supermini market in 1976 with the [[Volkswagen Polo]], a stylish and spacious three-door hatchback designed by [[Bertone]].  It was a strong seller in [[West Germany]] and most of the rest of [[Western Europe]], being one of the first foreign small cars to prove popular in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].  The second-generation model, launched in 1981 and sold as a hatchback and "coupe" (with the hatchback resembling a small estate car and the coupe being similar to a conventional hatchback), was an even greater success for Volkswagen.  It was facelifted<!--What exactly does that mean?--> in 1990 and was still selling well after 13 years, when it was replaced by the third-generation Polo in 1994.

===Volkswagen from 1991 to 2000===
[[Image:VWGolf4.jpg|thumb|right|The 2000 Volkswagen Golf GL, in North American form]]
In 1991, Volkswagen launched the third-generation Golf, which was [[European Car of the Year]] for 1992 (the previous two generations were nominated but lost to the [[Citroën CX]] in 1975 and the [[Fiat Uno]] in 1984). The [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3|Golf Mk3]] and Jetta arrived in [[North America]] just before the start of 1994 model year, first appearing in southern California in the late spring of 1993.  The sedan version of the Golf was badged Vento in Europe (but remained [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] in the USA, where its popularity eventually outstripped the Golf).

The late 1990s saw a gradual change in perception of the company's products - with [[Audi]] having elevated itself into same league as [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]], Volkswagen moved upmarket to fill the void left by Audi; with [[SEAT]] and the further addition of the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] car maker [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] being acquired in the late 1990s, now occupying what was once VW's core market.  The first tangible evidence of this was the fifth-generation [[Volkswagen Passat#Passat Mk5 (B5/B5.5) (1996–2005)|Passat]] in 1996 with its high-quality interior trim and standards of build quality which were demonstrably a cut above the run-of-the-mill [[Ford Mondeo]], [[Opel Vectra]] and [[Peugeot 406]].

This move upmarket was continued with the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Golf Mk4]], introduced at the end of 1997 (and in North America in 1999), its chassis spawned a host of other cars within the Volkswagen group — the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Volkswagen Bora]] (the sedan, still called Jetta in the USA), [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]], [[SEAT Toledo]], [[SEAT León]], [[Audi A3]], [[Audi TT]] and [[Škoda Octavia]].  However, it was beaten into third place for the 1998 [[European Car of the Year]] award by the winning [[Alfa Romeo 156]] and runner-up [[Audi A6]].

The other main models have been the [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], a smaller car than the Golf, and the larger [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] for the segment above the Golf.  The [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] and the later [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] were both Golf-based [[coupé]]s.

By the early 1990s, Volkswagen's annual sales in the United States were below 100,000, and many car buyers found the company's products to be lacking in value.  Some automotive journalists believed that Volkswagen would have to quit the North American market altogether.  VW eventually realized that the Beetle was the heart and soul of the brand in North America, and the firm quickly set about creating a new Beetle for American and Canadian showrooms.
[[Image:VW-New-Beetle.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Volkswagen New Beetle]] proved to be a popular concept, especially in North America.]]
In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the [[J Mays]]-designed [[Volkswagen New Beetle#Concept 1|Concept One]], a "retro"-themed car with a resemblance to the original Beetle but based on the Polo platform.  Its genesis was secret and in opposition to VW management, who felt it was too backward-looking.  Management could not deny the positive public response to the concept car and gave the green light to its development as the [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]].  The production car would be based on the Golf rather than the Polo, because the Polo frame was too small for the car to pass crash test standards in the U.S. It has been quite popular in the North America and is now gaining in the [[European Union]].

Volkswagen's fortunes in North America improved once the third-generation Golf and Jetta models became available there.  Sharp advertising and clever promotional stunts, like including [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]] bicycles, and accompanying bicycle racks with a limited edition of the 1996 Jetta sedan, were credited for the firm's recovery in the U.S. and Canada, but the introductions of the New Beetle and the fifth-generation [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] were a major boost to the brand.

In the UK, Volkswagen's market share grew throughout the 1990s.  In 1990, the Golf was Britain's 12th most popular car with nearly 50,000 units sold.  The [[Volkswagen Polo Mk3|Mk3 Polo]] achieved similar success in the mid 1990s, but in 1999 the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4 Golf]] was Volkswagen's first ever entrant in Britain's top 10 list of most popular new cars.  Its success continued into the 2000s, while the Polo and Passat were never far outside the top 10.  Bad news for Volkswagen during this era was a dip in customer satisfaction.  A brand which had built its reputation on reliability was now being overtaken by marques whose reputations had been damaged by quality problems.  This bad press took several years to eradicate.

In the late 1990s Volkswagen acquired the three luxury brands Lamborghini (through Audi), Bentley and Bugatti which were mainly due to [[Ferdinand Piëch]] and added to the group portfolio. Audi's plans for Lamborghini included a small supercar later to be named the Gallardo, and a new [[halo vehicle]], the [[Lamborghini Murciélago|Murciélago]], and later the Reventon limited edition halo car. In late 2008 the idea of a 4-door saloon for the Lamborghini brand was shown in the form of the Lamborghini Estoque concept.

For Bentley, its future within the Volkswagen group seemed bright as the launch of the [[Bentley Continental]] range helped Bentley post record-breaking sales of 10,000. Bentley is in 2009 going to launch a new Arnage-replacing car codenamed Project Kimberly, the car being named the 'New Grand Bentley.' The name is uncertain.<!--Does this mean the Bentley Continental Supersports?-->

Bugatti, after Volkswagen purchased the rights to use the name, showed three concept cars, the [[Bugatti EB110]] (coupe and saloon) and the Bugatti Chiron. Bugatti then launched the [[Veyron]] hypercar, with a top speed of {{convert|252|mph|0|abbr=on}}. Although Bugatti makes a huge loss on every Veyron, Volkswagen is still going to keep the brand and maybe will launch a new [[Rolls Royce Phantom]]-rivaling saloon rumoured to be called Royale.

===Volkswagen in the 21st century===
[[Image:2006 Phaeton.jpg|thumb|right|2006 [[Volkswagen Phaeton]]]]
Volkswagen began introducing an array of new models after [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]] became [[Volkswagen Group]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] (responsible for all Group brands) in 2002.  The fifth-generation [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|VW Golf]] was launched in 2004, came runner-up to the [[Fiat Panda]] in the 2004 [[European Car of the Year]], and has spawned several cousins: [[VW Bora]], [[SEAT León]], [[SEAT Toledo]], [[Škoda Octavia]] and [[Audi A3]] hatchback ranges, as well as a new mini-[[Multi-purpose vehicle|MPV]], the [[SEAT Altea]].  The GTI, a "[[hot hatch]]back" performance version of the Golf, boasts a 2.0&nbsp;L [[Turbocharger|Turbocharged]] Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] engine.  VW began marketing the Golf under the Rabbit name once again in the U.S. and Canada in June 2006.  (The GTI had arrived to North America four months earlier).  The fifth-generation Jetta, and the performance version, the GLI, are also available in the United States and Canada.  The sixth-generation Passat and the fifth-generation Jetta both debuted in 2005, and VW has announced plans to expand its lineup further by bringing back the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] by 2008.  Other models in [[Wolfgang Bernhard]]'s (Volkswagen brand CEO) "product offensive" include the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]] mid-sized SUV in 2008 and a [[Volkswagen Passat Coupé|Passat Coupé]].  In November 2006 Bernd Pischetsrieder announced his resignation as Volkswagen Group CEO, and was replaced by [[Audi]] worldwide CEO [[Martin Winterkorn]] at the beginning of 2007.  Winterkorn is credited with making Audi a challenger to the dominance of BMW and Mercedes, and his design-led strategy has led to Audi being considered one of the most important brands in the world.  It remains to be seen how Winterkorn's focus on design shapes the Volkswagen brand's future.  Nevertheless, Volkswagen continues to have complicated relations with both unions and shareholders.  The German state of [[Lower Saxony]] owns significant stock in VW, as does sportscar manufacturer [[Porsche]].
[[Image:VWpassat.JPG|thumb|left|The B5.5 fifth-generation [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] facelift]]

In North America, VW faced many challenges.  After rising significantly between 1998 and 2001, VW's North American sales began to fall sharply leading to a 2005 loss of roughly [[United States dollar|US$]]1 billion for its operations in the U.S. and Canada.  Profitability has not been strong, and the lack of reliability of the company's cars appears to bear some of the responsibility for this situation.  By 2005, its models sat near the bottom of ''Consumer Reports'' reliability ratings, and J.D. Power and Associates ranked VW 35th out of 37 bands in its initial quality survey.  Attempts to enter a new market segment also compromised Volkswagen's standing in North America.  In 2002, Volkswagen announced the debut of its [[Volkswagen Phaeton|Phaeton]] luxury car, which was critically acclaimed but not well received in the marketplace.  VW announced its discontinuance in the U.S. market for the 2007 model year due to the disappointing sales.
[[Image:JettaMkV.JPG|thumb|right|The 2006 [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]]]]

Volkswagen in 2005, despite challenges, still maintained North American sales of 224,195—a dramatic increase from the low in 1993 when US sales totaled only 49,533 vehicles.  Momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as VW's North American sales for the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 percent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. VW plans to close out the decade{{When|date=October 2008}}<!-- which decade? Avoid time sensitive wording --> with the release on several new vehicles worldwide and a barrage of advertising.  In conjunction with the introduction of new models, production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent great change.  The 2007 [[Volkswagen Eos|Eos]], a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal.  All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than VW's [[Mexico|Mexican]] factory in [[Puebla]], where Golfs and GTIs for the North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and the Brazilian factory in [[Curitiba]], where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006.  (The [[Jetta]] has primarily been made in [[Mexico]] since 1989).  VW is also in the process of reconfiguring an automotive assembly plant in [[Belgium]].  The new models and investments in manufacturing improvements were noticed immediately by automotive critics.  Favorable reviews for VW's newest cars include the GTI being named by ''Consumer Reports'' as the top sporty car under $25,000, one of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's "[[Car and Driver Ten Best|10 Best]]" for 2007, [[Automobile Magazine|''Automobile'' Magazine's]] 2007 Car of the Year, as well as a 2008 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison ranking the midsize Passat first in its class.  The [[J. D. Power and Associates]] 2006 Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout (APEAL) Study scored Volkswagen fourteenth overall with strong performances by its new Jetta and Passat models.
[[Image:Vwgolf.jpg|thumb|left|The fifth-generation [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], sold in North America as the Rabbit.]]

Volkswagen is recognized as one of the leading small [[diesel engine]] manufacturers, and is partnering with [[Daimler AG|Mercedes]] and other companies to market [[BlueTec]] clean diesel technology, calling it [[BlueMotion]].  Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI ([[Turbocharged Direct Injection]]) engine, which lends class-leading fuel economy to several models.  According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], four of the ten most fuel-efficient vehicles available for sale in the U.S. in 2004 were powered by Volkswagen diesel engines.  They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon.  As of 2007, VW has not yet offered a petrol-electric hybrid powertrain such as that in the [[Toyota Prius]] (though a diesel-electric hybrid 5th generation Jetta was produced as a test vehicle).  In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2003-2006 can be driven on 100% [[biodiesel]] fuel. For the 2007 model year, however, strict U.S. government emissions regulations have forced VW to drop most diesels from their U.S. engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines compatible to U.S. standards are due for 2008.
[[Image:2006 VW Eos.JPG|thumb|right|The 2006 [[Volkswagen Eos|Eos]] hardtop convertible]]

Volkswagen long resisted adding a utility vehicle to its lineup, but it finally relented with the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] in the early 2000s, sharing major components with the [[Porsche Cayenne]] and [[Audi Q7]] sport utility vehicles.  Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best.  Some automotive analysts blame the Touraeg's absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass.  VW plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from its "Concept A" concept vehicle.  On July 20, 2006, VW announced that the new vehicle would be called the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]]. Since the discontinuance of the T4 in 2003 and decision not to bring the T5 to the US market, it was ironic that Volkswagen lacked a van in its North American lineup considering that VW was a major player in the development of the class with its original [[Volkswagen Transporter|Transporter]]. The firm did however launch a rebadged [[DaimlerChrysler]] named the [[Volkswagen Routan]] for the U.S. and Canadian markets in 2008. Owing to technical difficulty adapting the [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] to meet North American vehicle regulations, VW presented in 2006 the "Iroc" as a concept of the proposed 2009 Scirocco as a potential new small model.

In September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4#Mk4 "City Golf (Golf City in 2009)" in Canada, South America & Bora HS in China|City Golf]] and City Jetta only for the Canadian market.  Both models were originally the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4 Golf]] and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and [[Volkswagen Jetta#Ongoing production|Bora]].  The City Golf and City Jetta were introduced to compete with the [[Toyota Yaris]] and [[Honda Fit]].  Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.

When [[Martin Winterkorn]] became the eighth postwar CEO of Volkswagen, the company made several personnel changes in Wolfsburg.  Though the VW Group already had their presence in India with [[Škoda Auto]], Volkswagen introduced the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] and [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] with TDI engine to India's automobile market in September 2007.

The [[Volkswagen 1-litre car|VW 1L]] will be available in 2010, in limited numbers. The 1L is a lightweight two-person vehicle made out of a magnesium frame covered by an unpainted carbon-fiber skin. Every component of the vehicle is intended to reduce the vehicle's weight. Aluminum brakes, carbon-fiber wheels, titanium hubs, and ceramic bearings all contribute to the vehicle's light weight of a mere 290&nbsp;kg. To reduce the weight even further, and to increase the aerodynamics of the vehicle, there are no rearview mirrors. Instead, the car is equipped with cameras that display visual information to the driver through the internal LCD screen.
The car is extremely fuel-efficient, each gallon<!--Imperial or US?--> of fuel will take you over 235 miles. The fuel tank holds just 1.7 gallons<!--Imperial or US?-->, making the entire travel distance capability about 400 miles per tank. Its top speed is {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, which although not very fast is a welcome tradeoff for the huge savings in fuel consumption.

On July 15, 2008 Volkswagen announced that they will construct an automobile assembly plant in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].<ref name=Boston>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/07/16/vw_picks_tenn_for_its_1st_us_car_plant_since_88/ |title=VW picks Tenn. for its 1st US car plant since '88 |work=[[Bloomberg News]]|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2008-07-16}}</ref> This plant will produce cars specifically designed for North America beginning with the [[Volkswagen New Midsize Sedan|New Midsize Sedan]], which will be more competitive with North American market leaders [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Honda Accord]].

==Relationship with Porsche, and the ''Volkswagen Law''==
Volkswagen has always had a close relationship with [[Porsche]], the [[Stuttgart|Zuffenhausen]]-based sports car manufacturer founded in 1931 by [[Ferdinand Porsche]], the original Volkswagen designer.  The first Porsche car, the [[Porsche 64]] of 1938, used many components from the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].  The 1948 [[Porsche 356]] continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned [[engine]], [[gearbox]] and suspension.

The two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914 and 914-6]], whereby the 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had a 4-cylinder Volkswagen engine, and in 1976 with the [[Porsche 912]]E (USA only), and the [[Porsche 924]], which used many [[Audi]] components and was built at an Audi [[Neckarsulm]] factory.  Most [[Porsche 944|944s]] also were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.

The [[Porsche Cayenne]], introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with [[Volkswagen Touareg|VW Touareg]] and [[Audi Q7]], which are built at the Volkswagen factory in [[Bratislava]].

In September 2005, Porsche announced it would increase its 5% stake in Volkswagen to 20% at a cost of €3 billion, with the intention that the combined stakes of Porsche and the government of [[Lower Saxony]] would ensure that any hostile takeover by foreign investors would be impossible.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm BBC NEWS | Porsche wants 20% Volkswagen deal | 26 September 2005]</ref>  Speculated suitors included [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[BMW]], and [[Renault]]. In July 2006, Porsche increased their ownership again to 25.1%.

On February 13, 2007 [[Advocate General]] [[Dámaso Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer]] ruled that a German law preventing any shareholder in Volkswagen from executing more than 20% of the total voting rights in the firm was illegally restricting the flow of capital in Europe.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6356787.stm BBC NEWS | Top EU court finds against VW law]</ref> This again opened the possibility of a hostile takeover of VW and so on [[26 March]] of the same year Porsche took its holding of Volkswagen shares to 30.9%. Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen, but intended the move to avoid a competitor taking a large stake and to stop hedge funds from dismantling VW.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6494593.stm BBC NEWS | Porsche triggers VW takeover bid]</ref> As expected, on October 22, 2007 the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled in agreement with Ruiz-Jarabo and the law was struck down.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/business/worldbusiness/23cnd-volks.html New York Times | Court Strikes Down "Volkswagen Law"]</ref>
{{Wikinews|Porsche and Volkswagen automakers agree to merger}}
On October 26, 2008, Porsche finally revealed its plan to assume control of VW. As of that day, it held 42.6 percent of Volkswagen's ordinary shares and stock options on another 31.5 percent. Combined with the state of [[Lower Saxony]]'s 20.1% stake, this left only 5.8% of shares on the market most of which were held by index funds who could not legally sell.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/05a4df12-a396-11dd-942c-000077b07658.html Financial Times | Porsche plans to raise VW stake to 75%]</ref> [[Hedge fund]]s desperate to cover their [[short sell|short]] positions forced Volkswagen stock above one thousand euros per share, briefly making it the world's largest company by [[market capitalization]] on October 28, 2008.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/05bbd234-a4d2-11dd-b4f5-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1 VW vies for title of world's biggest company]</ref>

On 6th of May 2009 the two companies decided to join together, in a merger.

On [[August 13]], Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft's Supervisory Board signed the agreement to create an integrated automotive group with Porsche led by Volkswagen. The initial decision was for Volkswagen to take a 42.0 percent stake in Porsche AG by the end of 2009, and it would also see the family shareholders selling the automobile trading business of Porsche Holding Salzburg to Volkswagen.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.taume.com/World-Business/Business-Finance/Volkswagen-to-take-a-42-0-percent-stake-in-Porsche-AG-11861|title=Volkswagen to take a 42.0 percent stake in Porsche AG  |accessdate=2009-01-22 |publisher=Taume News|date=2009-08-14}}</ref> In October 2009 however, Volkswagen announced that its percentage in Porsche would be 49.9% for a cost of 3.9 billion euros (the 42.0% deal would have cost 3.3 billion euros).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8317010.stm|title=VW to buy half of Porsche by 2010  |accessdate=2009-10-20 |publisher=BBC News|date=2009-10-20}}</ref>

[[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America Inc.]] promotes its work in developing "clean diesel", and other fuel-efficient technologies, to increase U.S. sales to environmentally conscious consumers.  One of the vehicles being promoted is the 2009 clean-diesel Jetta TDI, which has a 16-valve, four-cylinder [[common rail]] [[direct injection]] engine which reduces emissions by 90 percent.  Volkswagen also claims that this model has the advantage of [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] in the mid-50s and mid-40s<!--Would that be km/h, mph or Fahrenheit?

===Neat ethanol vehicles===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F053242-0034, Hannover, Messe.jpg|thumb|right| VW neat [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] prototype car developed by [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] in 1978.]]
[[Volkswagen do Brasil]] produced and sold neat ethanol vehicles ([[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|E100 only]]) in Brazil, and production was discontinued only after they were substituted by the more modern technology of [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s. As a response to the [[1973 oil crisis]], the Brazilian government began promoting bioethanol as a fuel, and the [[Pro-Álcool|National Alcohol Program]] -''Pró-Álcool''- ({{lang-pt|Programa Nacional do Álcool}}) was launched in 1975.<ref name="Bastos">{{Cite web| url=http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=534 | author=Milton Briquet Bastos |title=Brazil's Ethanol Program – An Insider's View  |publisher=Energy Tribune | date=2007-06-20 | accessdate=2008-08-14 | language= }}</ref><ref name="Veja1979" /><ref name="SeatleT" /> Compelled by the [[1979 energy crisis|second oil crisis]], and after development and testing with government fleets by the [[Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology (CTA)]] (CTA) at [[São José dos Campos]], and further testing of several prototypes developed by the four local carmakers, including Volkswagen do Brasil, neat ethanol vehicles were launched in the Brazilian market beginning in that year.<ref name="Bastos" /><ref name="Veja1979">{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/idade/exclusivo/petroleo/130679.html |title=O petróleo da cana |author=[[Revista Veja]] |publisher=[[Editora Abril]] |date=1979-06-13|accessdate=2008-11-29|language=Portuguese}}</ref> Gasoline engines were modified to support [[hydrous]] ethanol characteristics and changes included [[compression ratio]], amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder [[spark plugs]] suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.

Production and sales of neat ethanol vehicles tumbled beginning in 1987 owing to several factors, including a sharp decline in gasoline prices as a result of the [[1980s oil glut]], and high sugar prices in the world market, shifting sugarcane ethanol production from fuel to sugar. By mid 1989 a shortage of ethanol fuel supply in the local market left thousands of vehicles in line at gas stations or out of fuel in their garages, forcing consumers to abandon ethanol vehicles.<ref name="SeatleT">{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002339093_brazilfuel17.html|publisher=The Seattle Times|title=Brazil's ethanol effort helping lead to oil self-sufficiency|author=Marla Dickerson|date=2005-06-17|accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref><ref name="Veja1989">{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/arquivo_veja/capa_24051989.shtml|title=Um sonho corroído|author=[[Revista Veja]] |publisher=[[Editora Abril]] |date=1989-05-24|accessdate=2008-11-29|language=Portuguese}}</ref>

==Electric vehicles==
{{Main|Electric vehicle|E-Up!}}

Volkswagen announced it has hired [[Karl-Thomas Neumann]] as its group chief officer for [[electric traction]].<ref>http://rumors.automobilemag.com/6605889/news/volkswagen-hires-new-electric-vehicle-chief/index.html</ref>

Volkswagen and [[Sanyo]] have teamed up to develop a [[hybrid vehicle]] battery system.<ref>[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2006/02/03/209275.html Volkswagen and Sanyo Team Up To Develop Hybrid Battery Systems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Volkswagen head [[Martin Winterkorn]] has confirmed the company plans to build compact hybrid vehicles. He has stated "There will definitely be compact hybrid models, such as [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] and [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], and without any great delay", with  gasoline and [[diesel engine]]s.  For example, Golf is the ideal model to go hybrid as the Golf 1.4 TSI was recently awarded the “Auto Environment Certificate” by the [[Oko-Trend Institute for Environmental Research]], and was considered as one of the most environmentally friendly vehicles of 2007.<ref>http://www.green-hybrid-cars.com/volkswagen-hybrid.html "Volkswagen Hybrid: Runaway Winner". Eco-Friendly Hybrid Cars, May 2, 2008</ref>  Also underway at Volkswagen's [[Braunschweig]] [[Research and development|R&D]] facilities in Northern Germany is a hybrid version of the next-generation [[Touareg]], due in 2010.<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=119559 Compact Hybrid Coming From Volkswagen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

VW intends all future models to have the hybrid option.  “Future VW models will fundamentally also be constructed with hybrid concepts,” VW head of development [[Ulrich Hackenberg]] told ''[[Automobilwoche]]'' in an interview.  Hackenberg mentioned that the car based on the [[Volkswagen up!|up!]] concept seen at [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122568 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show: Volkswagen Up!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, as well as all future models, could be offered with either full or partial hybrid options.  The rear-engine up! will go into production in 2011.  Nothing has been said about [[plug-in hybrid]] options.<ref>[http://www.egmcartech.com/2007/09/24/report-all-volkswagen-models-to-have-hybrid-option/ Report: All Volkswagen models to have hybrid option | eGMCarTech<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

VW's Chief of research, Dr. Jürgen Leohold, said the company has concluded [[fuel-cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel-cell cars]] are not a viable option.<ref>[http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/876.html Audi's PHEV Concept; Volkswagen Research Chief Criticizes Fuel Cells<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/Volkswagen-Concepts/229005/ Fuel cell cars won't save the world]</ref>

==Cult status of the Beetle==
[[Image:vws.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Beetles used as taxis in Mexico City]]
Like its competitors, the [[Mini]], the [[Citroën 2CV]] and the [[Fiat 500]], the original-shape [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] long outlasted predictions of its lifespan.  It maintains a very strong following worldwide, being regarded as something of a "[[Cult following|cult car]]", owing to its 1960s association with the [[hippie]] movement.  Currently, there is a wide array of clubs that are concerned with the Beetle.  The fans are quite diverse.  Looks include the resto-look, [[Cal Look]], German-look, resto-Cal Look, buggies, [[Baja Bug]]s, [[old school]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[Herbie|Herbie the Love Bug replicas]], ratlook, etc.  Part of their cult status is attributed to being one of a few cars with an [[air-cooled]], [[Flat engine|horizontally-opposed engine]] design, and the consequent ease of repair and modification, as opposed to the more conventional and technically complex watercooled engine design.  The original flat-four boxer design had fewer than 200 moving parts.

By 2002, over 21 million Type 1s had been produced.

On 30 July 2003, the last Type 1 rolled off the production line in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Mexico]].  It was car number 21,529,464, and was immediately shipped off to the company's museum in [[Wolfsburg, Germany]].  In true [[Mexico|Mexican]] fashion, a big celebration and a [[mariachi]] band serenaded the last car in the<!--factory's? model's?--> 68-year-old history.  The last car was nicknamed ''[[El Rey]]'', which is Spanish for "The King", named after a legendary [[Mexico|Mexican]] song by [[José Alfredo Jiménez]].  The last 3000 type 1s were called the "Última Edición" or the final edition.

In the [[United States]], Volkswagen enthusiasts frequent large Volkswagen-themed car shows, especially in the summer months.  Many of these shows feature camping, a car show called a "show 'n' shine", [[drag racing]], parts swap meet, raffles, burnout contests, and other events.  Die-hard and loyal "VW-heads" or "Dubbers" attend these shows regularly, often traveling {{convert|500|mi|km}} or more (even abroad) to attend their favorite event.

In the winter, a group of drivers of the "[[Volkswagen Type 2|Splitscreen]]" bus model (1951-1967 Microbuses, trucks, campers, and panel vans) drive from [[Willits, California]], to [[Mount Shasta]], [[California]], largely on unpaved back roads.  This event is called the "Mt. Shasta Snow Trip Challenge" and is a good example of VW enthusiasts' trust in the durability of their 40-year-old (or older) cars.

==Motorsport==
* In 1966, Volkswagen starting in [[Formula Vee]] — circuit racing with cars built from easily available [[Volkswagen Beetle#Power|Beetle]] parts — took off in Europe.
