The '''Porsche 64''', also known as the '''VW Aerocoupe''', '''Type 64''' and '''Type 60K10''', is considered by many to be the first [[automobile]] from what was to become the [[Porsche]] company, as a true design precursor to the production model of after the war. The model number comes from the fact that it was built mainly from design drawings for the Type-64 "record car". Most mechanical parts came from the 38 prototype series.  The chassis was heavily reinforced and the engine also reworked to produce around 45-50 brake [[horse power]]. The Type-64 was only a drawing until the three racers were built.  The body was also a compromise in that the cab had to look like a KdF car, but the rest was 'record' car.  The [[VW beetle]] was the Type-60, and the name the "60K10" means body design 10 for the Type-60 Beetle. Its [[flat-four]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] produced 50 [[Horsepower#Brake horsepower (bhp)|bhp]] and gave a top speed of around {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

The body design was made by the Porsche Büro after [[wind tunnel]] tests for a planned [[V10 engine|V10]] sports car that never came into existence, the [[Porsche 114|Type 114]]. Dr. Porsche promoted the idea to enter the car into the 1939 Berlin-Rome race as a public relations ploy. Three cars were made in hand shaped [[aluminium]] by the bodywork company Reutter. One was destroyed  early in [[World War II]]. The two remaining were used by the Porsche family.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Eventually they only used one of them and put the other in storage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In May 1945 American troops discovered the one put in storage, cut the roof off and used it for [[Joyride (crime)|joyriding]] for a few weeks until the engine gave up and it was scrapped. The last remaining Porsche 64 was owned by [[Ferry Porsche]] who had it restored by [[Battista Farina]] in 1947. In 1949 it was sold to the [[Austria]]n [[motorcycle]] racer [[Otto Mathé]] and with it he won the Alpine Rally in 1950. The last time he drove it in a race was at the [[Monterey Historic Races]] in [[Monterey, California]], in 1982.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
