The '''Mercedes-Benz B-Class''' (codename W245) is a [[compact MPV]] introduced by German automaker [[Mercedes-Benz]] in March 2005. It is essentially an enlarged [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class|A-Class]] keeping the same [[engine]] and [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension system]]. Like the A-Class, and unlike any other vehicle Mercedes builds or has built, the B-Class is a [[front wheel drive]] vehicle.

Mercedes-Benz describes this vehicle as a ''Compact Sports Tourer'' instead of [[hatchback]] or [[multi-purpose vehicle]], like its [[Mercedes-Benz R-Class|R-Class]] model, which is called a ''Grand Sports Tourer''.

It was released in Europe in the late spring of 2005 and in Canada in the autumn of 2005. Plans to import the car to the US through Mexico were put on hold due to a strong euro, but it is likely that a new version of the car will come to the US in 2011.

== Design ==
Keeping in mind its United States' market in comparison with the A-Class and indeed emulating the R-Class, the aspect of the B-Class was stylized from the back to the nose. Some of the tiny stylistic details of the ''Baby-Benz'' (popular name of the A-Class) were removed. In particular, the front of the vehicle was lengthened (although maintaining the ''Sandwich'' anti-crash system).

== Sandwich floor concept ==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[image:zzz-W169-001.gif|thumb|213px|Patented Sandwich floor concept.]] -->

The B-Class W245 maintains the sandwich floor concept.

The [[powertrain]] ([[engine]] and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]) moves beneath the passenger cell (located at high seating position) in the event of a big frontal impact.
According to a study [http://www.germancarfans.com/news.cfm/newsid/2040629.001/page/6/lang/eng/mercedes/1.html]: "the front section of the A-Class would have to be considerably longer in order to offer the same impressive level of occupant safety in the event of a heavy frontal impact".

These are two innovations, patented by Mercedes-Benz as:

# DE 43 26 396 C 2: motor car with drive unit tilted at an acute angle against the horizontal
# DE 44 00 132 C1: [[Firewall (construction)|Firewall]] construction for a motor car with front-mounted drive unit

As a secondary benefit, because the seats have been raised by 20&nbsp;cm, the passengers are taken away from the more common area of lateral impact in accidents.

== Driving assistants ==
[[Image:Mercedes Benz B 170 silver vl.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pre-facelift B-Class 170]]
The B-Class presents a wide interior, basically due to the Sandwich floor.

The [[multifunction steering wheel]] (standard feature) allows the driver to use his/her thumbs to control the radio, telephone and other systems.
The [[power assisted steering]] (standard feature) aids in the control of the automobile, varying according to the speed.

The [[Comand APS|COMAND APS]] is a system where Route instructions are given to the navigation system, and the information is provided via [[Short message service|SMS]].
The car radio, [[DVD]] and telephone controls are combined into a single unit with a 6.5 inch screen.
The options are: standard Audio 20 radio/single CD, Audio 50 APS or COMAND APS.

[[Parktronic]] emits warning tones and uses multiple [[LED]]s to indicate how far the car is from an obstacle.

W245 defines the [[Light & Sight package]] with several benefits:
* [[Bi-xenon HID headlamp]]s ([[options (automobile)|optional feature]]) with gas-discharge bulbs for the dipped beam
* [[Cornering light]]s (standard feature) where the main-beam dips at road junctions and tight corners
* [[Active light system]] (standard feature) where the beams follows the steering movements
* [[Headlamp Assist]] (standard feature) is a sensor on the windscreen monitoring ambient light levels to automatically switch on the headlamps as required
* [[Rain sensor]] (standard feature) smoothly adjusts the [[Windscreen wiper|wiper]] speed, depending on the intensity of the rainfall.

As a standard addition, when entering a tunnel or an underground garage, the [[Tunnel Mode]] closes all windows and the panoramic sliding [[sunroof]].

== Inside comfort ==
The [[multicontour seat]] (optional feature) is composed of a set of small air [[cushion]]s individually adjusted to the driver's body, as he/she wishes.

=== Air conditioning ===
The W245 units have a powerful [[car air conditioning]] system, with separate temperature adjustment for driver and front passenger.

Standard CDI models include a [[Heater Booster System]] (standard on CDI models) that instantly floods  the interior of the B-Class with hot air.
The most advanced system is the [[Thermotronic]] (optional feature) that maintains and regulates the temperature in accordance with a sophisticated set of [[sensors]] which  measure  temperature, sunlight, humidity and even pollutant levels in the ambient air, causing  all openings to close automatically.

=== Sunroof ===
The new optional [[sunroof]] is divided in small panels that can be displaced individually. Each one can be controlled separately to selectively administer the shades inside the W245.

== Safety ==

High-strength and ultra-high-strength steel [[alloy]]s are combined with high-strength bonded [[joint]]s.

=== Airbags ===

The B-Class has several [[airbag]]s. The front airbag is adaptive with two-stage gas generators (standard feature), where the system evaluates the severity of the accident. The B-Class also includes side airbags for head and thorax (standard for driver and front passenger).

Two other additions are optional: Rear Sidebags (optional feature) for side-on collisions in the back seats and Windowbags: large airbags expanding like a curtain from A- to C-pillars in side-on collisions.

=== Belts ===

The belt system of the B-Class W245 is simply surprising.
The [[Adaptive Function]] (standard feature for driver and front passenger) adapts the force exerted by the [[Seat belt|belt]], relaxing dynamically during the collision. On the other hand, the [[Tensioner]]s (standard feature) continuously adjust to remove any possible slack, and increase the tightness if necessary. The driver is notified if all the belts are buckled (standard feature).

=== Head and neck ===

Lastly, the [[active head restraint]]s (standard feature) respond actively to a collision, assuring even more protection.

=== Other standard features ===
While driving there is the [[Acceleration Slip Regulation|Acceleration-Skid Control]] (ASR) (standard feature) and Electronic Stability Program [[Electronic Stability Control|ESP]] (standard feature) that reduce the risk of skidding.
There are disc brakes on all four wheels, and emergency stops are improved with the [[Anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) and Brake Assist System (BAS), standard on the Mercedes Benz A-Class.
BAS detects emergency braking (most drivers apply the brakes quickly but without enough pressure) and exerts maximum brake pressure.

== Making room ==

To make more room for transporting goods, it is possible to fold the seats forward and then level them at two different heights. They provide different final modular space combinations.

Its implementation is provided by two systems:

# Easy-Vario: Both rear-seat cushion sections are folded forward, while the luggage compartment floor can be set to one of two different heights. (Optional feature)
# Easy-Vario-Plus: Both rear-seat cushion and the front passenger seat are folded forward. This increases the load capacity to as much as 1995 litres. (Optional feature)

== Engines ==
All engines conform to [[European emission standards|Euro IV]] emission standards.  A [[particulate filter system]] is available as an option for the diesel units (this reduces about 99% of the particle emissions, without the need for additives).

=== Gearboxes ===
The B-Class is available with five and six-speed [[manual transmission]]s. The six-speed gearbox is the standard on B180 CDI, B200 CDI and B200 Turbo.

As an option there is an Autotronic [[Continuously Variable Transmission]] (CVT) in which the ratios are changed continuously by means of a [[pulley-wheel variator]] and a [[steel thrust belt]].  This allows the car to accelerate with no interruption of tractive power and attains the maximum output more quickly. This is adjustable according to driving style: economical or sporty.

== Wheel axles ==
The B-Class is a [[front-wheel drive]] car.

In the W245 the dynamic [[car handling|handling]] was powered in precision tracking and anti-roll support, with the [[Parabolic Rear Axle]] (standard feature) that grants a pivotal role in the driving.
The car has a [[Selective Damping System]] (standard feature), where the shock absorber forces are administered differentially, in example under normal conditions (soft absorption) and while cornering at speed (full damping force).

The W245 presents [[light alloy]] wheels. With the [[run-flat tire|run-flat]] feature (continuous mobility or zero-pressure tyres can be driven at normal speeds).  There is [[Tirefit]] tyre [[sealant]] and a [[tire-pressure-loss warning device]] by ESP technology (standard feature).

== 2008 B-Class facelift ==
[[Image:'09 Mercedes-Benz B-Class.JPG|thumb|250px|right|2008 Mercedes-Benz B-Class (North America)]]
Mercedes-Benz has recently released a refreshed-look B-Class alongside a refreshed-look [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class|A-Class]] and [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class|M-Class]].

The newer B-Class has a restyled hood, front bumper, rear tail lamps, side exterior mirrors and is now available in the B170 NGT Blue Efficient. The B170 NGT Blue Efficient can run on either gas or petrol, and when full, can cover up to {{convert|1000|km}}.

The new B-Class is now available with new upholsteries and trims.
