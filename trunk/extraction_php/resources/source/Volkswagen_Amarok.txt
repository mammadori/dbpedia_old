The '''Volkswagen Amarok''' is a [[pickup truck]] which is due for imminent release by [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] (VWCV); it is anticipated to be released in Autumn 2009.<ref name="vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com">{{cite web|author=Posted by phaeton|url=http://vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com/2009/06/pickup-from-volkswagen-commercial.html|title=VW News Blog: Pickup from Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles to be called Amarok|publisher=Vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com|date=2009-06-05|accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref>  The Amarok range will consist of single cab and double cab, combined with either [[rear-wheel drive]] or [[4motion]] [[four-wheel drive]], and powered by [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]]s.  VWCV considers the [[Toyota Hilux]], [[Nissan Navara]] and [[Mitsubishi Triton]] to be Amarok competitors.

==History==
In 2005, [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] announced their intent to build a Robust Pick-Up and off road family of vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autoweb.com.au/cms/title_Volkswagen-Commercial-Vehicles-Innovative-Developments/A_104148/newsarticle.html|title=Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles innovative developments|work=Web Publications Pty Limited|publisher=AutoWeb.com.au|date=23 March 2005|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref>

In 2007, popular automotive website WorldCarFans.com publishes first photos captured by RoAnSa Carspy Photography of the development mule of the Robust Pick Up [[concept vehicle]] wearing [[Toyota Hilux]] body upon a Volkswagen developed chassis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10801292519/hilux-disguise-hides-new-volkswagen-taro|title=Hilux disguise hides new Volkswagen Taro|publisher=WorldCarFans.com|date=29 January 2008|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref>

In March 2008, famed automotive spy photographer Hans Lehmann captures the first image of the Robust Pick up wearing a production body which is designed by [[Walter de'Silva]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/219225/vw_pickup.html|title=VW pick-up - New VW pick-up caught cold|work=Dennis Publishing Limited|publisher=AutoExpress.co.uk|date=30 March 2008|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref>

In September 2008, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles releases the Robust Pick Up concept in the disguise as a Search and Rescue (SAR) vehicle, which previews the full design, and is said to be 95% close to the production version.<ref name="http">{{cite web|author=Posted by phaeton |url=http://vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com/2008/09/vw-pickup-revealed.html|title=VW News Blog: VW Pickup Revealed !!!!!!!|publisher=Vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com|date=2008-09-23|accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref>

===Naming===
The name 'Amarok' was developed and researched by branding agency [[Interbrand]] on request from Volkswagen.<ref name=Interbrand>{{cite web|url=http://www.interbrand.com/press_release.aspx?langid=1000&pressid=286|title=Interbrand names Volkswagen’s Amarok|work=Interbrand|publisher=Interbrand.com|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref>

Revealed to the public on 4 June 2009; [[Amarok]], which translates into Wolf in the [[Inuit]] language, also means 'he loves stones' in Romance languages of South America.<ref name="vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com"/><ref name=Interbrand/>

The new Amarok, the first pickup from Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, will be presented the general public in Argentina on 15 December 2009.

==Engines==
The Amarok will be powered by a range of [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[common rail]] [[diesel engine]]s, and [[direct injection]] [[petrol engine]] with a FlexFuel ([[ethanol]]) option for the [[Brazil]]ian market.<ref name="vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com"/>

==Production sites==
The Amarok will be produced in the [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|Volkswagen Group plant]] in [[General Pacheco]], [[Argentina]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/tnBasicIndustries-SP/idUSL1646949620071016|title=Volkswagen to invest 223 million euros in Argentina|work=Thomson Reuters|publisher=Reuters.com|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=Forbes>{{cite web|title=VW confirms stoppage of plans to build a Pick-up for European market|url=http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2008/07/04/afx5184241.html|work=Forbes.com LLC|publisher=Forbes.com|date=07.04.08|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> for [[South American]], [[Russia]]n, [[South African]], [[Australian]] and [[Europe]]an markets.<ref name="http"/>

It is expected to produce 90,000 Amaroks once production is at full capacity.<ref name=Forbes/>

The [[Hanover]] site was dropped from possible sites to produce the Amarok due to the Global Financial Crisis, and increasing economic costs in Europe.<ref name=Forbes/>

==Platform variants==
===Double Cab===
The Amarok will first be launched with a Double Cab variant.  The model-line code of the Double Cabin is VWN817.

===Single Cab===
The Single Cabin of the Amarok will be released late in 2010.

===Other Variants===
;Cab Chassis
In the Australian Publication ''Transport Today'', it was reported that Phil Clark, [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] [[Executive director|Director]] in [[Australia]], was trying to convince his German Bosses to add a Cab Chassis programme to Project RPU.<ref>{{citation|title=Transport Today - Issue 56|month=April/May|year=2006|page=50}}</ref>
;Spinoffs
Rumoured platform spinoffs include a five to seven seat [[Nissan Pathfinder]] and [[Mitsubishi Challenger]] rival.<ref>[http://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br/volkswagen-namib-e-taro-ii-a-pickup-e-a-suv-que-serao-fabricados-no-brasil/ Volkswagen Namib e Taro II, a pickup e a SUV que serÃ£o fabricados no Brasil<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Search and Rescue Pickup concept==
Volkswagen revealed their one tonne pickup study at the 2008 IAA Commercial Vehicle Show in September; the SAR Pickup measures {{convert|5.18|m|0|lk=on}} in length and {{convert|1.9|m|0}} in width, and the {{convert|1.55|m|0}} long cargo bed can carry a Euro sized broad pallet sideways.

SAR Pickup concept also was equipped for [[Lifeguards]] with: four mobile CB radios, flashlights, first aid kit with a defibrillator, binoculars, two safety helmets, removable [[neoprene]] seats for hard wearing, and a blue light roof module with integrated searchlight.

Possible production features that were on the concept: radio navigation system controlled by a multifunction touch screen, differential locks, cable winch and the rear logo opens the tailgate.<ref name="http"/>

==Amarok in the modern media==
Part of the new age media hype is for manufacturers is to mix it with the people.  Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles have done this with the Amarok creating a [[Twitter]] page called '''vwamarok''' with the item being the new vehicle pretending to be human, and posting its thoughts and also what it has been doing that day.

Volkswagen enthusiasts have also created a [[Facebook]] page for fans and future owners to post items relating to the Amarok.
