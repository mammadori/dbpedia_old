The '''BMW 700''' is a small [[rear-engined]] car produced by [[BMW]] from August 1959 to September 1965, based on the [[BMW 600]] (which was based on the [[Isetta]]).  Unlike the 600, however, the 700 was an all steel [[monocoque]] structure.   Styling was by [[Giovanni Michelotti]] – the car is sometimes compared with his other popular design of the same period, the [[Triumph Herald]]. A coupé and a cabriolet were also produced, whose bodies were made by [[Karosserie Baur]] of Stuttgart<ref>Oswald, op. cit., p. 184.</ref>.

It was powered by a 2-cylinder, air-cooled engine of 697&nbsp;cc from the [[BMW R67]] motorcycle.  The base version engine produced {{convert|32|PS|kW bhp|1|abbr=on}}. A top speed of 125 km/h (78 mph) was claimed<ref name=AlleAutosder50er/>.

In March 1962 the 700 saloon models were replaced by the BMW LS saloon, essentially the same car, but with its wheelbase stretched by {{convert|160|mm|in||abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|mm|in||abbr=on}} longer. In September 1964 the Coupé received, for its last year, the longer chassis and body and was accordingly rechristened BMW LS Coupé.

The 700 is one of several models credited with having rescued BMW from a terrible fate.   By the time production ended, 188,211 had been produced which was more than five times the number achieved by its [[BMW 600|predecessor model]].   This level of hitherto unprecedented commercial success enabled the company's small share holders, supported by a major share holder named [[Herbert Quandt]], to block a threatened take-over by [[Mercedes-Benz]].   The business thus stabilised, in 1961, BMW would be able to launch a second Michelotti styled sedan.   The [[BMW 1500]], supported by the sudden removal from the market place of the [[Borgward Isabella]], put an end to acute financial pressures that had haunted the business for two decades.

The 700 RS was a highly tuned version for racing. It had special, lightweight, aerodynamic bodywork and an engine tuned to {{convert|70|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. [[Hans Stuck]] campaigned the car with success. [[Jacky Ickx]] also raced in 700s.

After production ended, BMW did not enter production of small cars again until 2001 with the [[Mini (BMW)|Mini]].
