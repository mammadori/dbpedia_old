'''Formula Vee''' is a popular single-seater junior [[Auto racing|motor racing]] [[Formula racing|formula]], with relatively low costs in comparison to [[Formula Ford]] or [[Formula BMW]].

The class is based on a 1963 [[Volkswagen Beetle]], utilizing a collection of the stock parts to form a competitive race car around a purpose-built tube frame and racing tires.  The VW engine, transmission, front suspension, brakes and wheels are stock or modified stock parts.  The chassis is a tube frame design and the body is fiberglass or carbon fiber.  The intention of this class is for the average person to build and maintain the car.

Primarily a class in the [[Sports Car Club of America]] many other organizations have adopted the Formula Vee as a class.   Over the years, the rules have evolved to improve performance, lower cost, or to allow replacement of discontinued parts.

In 2008, a brand new ready-to-race car would cost about US $15,000.  The car could be bought as a kit for about US $8,000, minus the Volkswagen parts.  It costs approximately US $700 per race to maintain.

A top-running Formula Vee will go 120&nbsp;mph (190&nbsp;km/h) and corner at about 1.6 g. It weighs a minimum of 1,025&nbsp;pounds (465&nbsp;kg) with driver <ref>[http://www.scca.org/contentpage.aspx?content=44 (SCCA GCR 2009 specs)]</ref>.  

Each year, Formula Vee is one of the classes at the SCCA Runoffs, which awards a National Championship.

Variants of the Formula Vee rules exist in the Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, Germany and New Zealand.

A related category, [[Formula Super Vee]], evolved, using the water-cooled 1.6 litre VW four-cylinder engine in higher-tech and faster cars that initially drew much from Formula Ford practice, but later started to bear more kinship to [[Formula Three]] or [[Formula Atlantic]] chassis. This was successful in Europe for a while, but much more popular in the USA where it ran until the late 1980s.
