'''Framo''' was a minivan, motor tricycle and car manufacturer in [[Saxony]], [[Germany]]. It was established by [[Denmark|Danish]] engineer [[Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen]], the founder of [[DKW]], in 1923. Framo became the core of the [[Barkas]] minivan manufacturer in 1957.
 
==Formation==

Framo was founded by the [[Denmark|Danish]] engineer [[Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen]] and two colleagues (Paul Figura, and Richard Blau) as a components supplier in 1923. At this time, the company was called ''Metall-Werke Frankenberg GmbH'' and located in [[Frankenberg, Saxony]]. Rasmussen had earlier founded [[DKW]], and the Framo factory was created to produce components for DKW motorcycles. Rasmussen played an important role in the establishment of the [[Auto Union]] group, and DKW is represented by one ring of the four rings of the [[Audi]] brand today.

The production of a motorized freight [[trike]] (''VT 300'') started in Frankenberg in 1927. The idea was to combine a motorcycle with a cargo area. The tricycles were equipped with a one-cylinder-two-stroke engine made by [[DKW]]. Framo's lightweight and affordable motorized freight trikes were popular with craftsmen and tradesmen. Based on this success, the models ''ZW&nbsp;200'', ''LT&nbsp;200'', ''LTH&nbsp;200'' and ''LTH&nbsp;300'' were developed.

In 1934, the company moved to [[Hainichen]] and was subsequently rebranded as FRAMO-Werke GmbH, [[Hainichen]]. Framo is a made-up word based on FRankenberg and MOtorenwerk (engine plant). At this point, the company was already employing 700 workers. 1934 also saw the development of compact cars. First, the tricycle ''Stromer FP 200'' was released. Its successors ''Piccolo VH 200'' and ''Piccolo VH 300'' had four wheels. Overall, the cars were not a huge success and only 1,070 units were sold.

Following up on the earlier success of the motorized freight trikes, a new line of [[minivan]]s with four wheels was introduced in 1938. The first model was called ''V&nbsp;500''.

==World War II==
The production of military products and weapons began in 1943. From September 1944 until April 1945, 500 female prisoners of a subcamp of the [[Flossenburg concentration camp]] were forced to work for the Framo enterprise.<ref>Christine O'Keefe.''Concentration
Camps.''[www.tartanplace.com/tartanhistory/concentrationcamps.html]</ref>

==East Germany==
In 1945, on the orders of the occupying Soviet military administration, the factories were dismantled as part of [[war reparations]] and shipped to the [[Soviet Union]].

The factory restarted the assembly of the pre-war-model (V 501/2) in 1949. The newly developed postwar models ''V&nbsp;901'' and ''V&nbsp;902'' entered the market in 1951. The development of varying superstructures began in 1953.

In 1957, the Framo company was succeeded by the [[Barkas]]-Werke Hainichen (later [[VEB]] Barkas [[Chemnitz]]), where the production of ''Barkas'' minivans began.

==Framo museum==
A museum dedicated to the brands ''Framo'' and ''Barkas'' was opened in [[Frankenberg, Saxony]] in 1993. As of 2007, eighteen cars, motorized tricycles and minivans are on display.
