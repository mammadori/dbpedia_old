'''Hans Glas [[GmbH]]''' is a former German automotive company, which was based in [[Dingolfing]].  Originally a maker of farm machinery, Glas evolved first into a producer of motor scooters, then automobiles.  It was purchased by [[BMW]] in 1966, with its limited model range shortly phased out by its new parent.

==History==
[[Image:Glas 1700GT 1965 1.JPG|right|thumb|Glas 1700 GT Cabriolet, 1965]]
[[Mechanic]] Andreas Glas founded a repair company for agricultural machines at 1895 in [[Pilsting]]. He named the company ''Andreas Glas, Reparaturwerkstätte für landwirtschaftliche Maschinen mit Dampfbetrieb'' (in [[English language|English]]: Andreas Glas, repair-shop for steam-powered agricultural machines). During the summer periods about 16 people worked for him. In 1905 Andreas Glas' company built their first [[sowing machine]]s. He then had sufficient work to employ all his employees during the winters. The production of sowing machines rose from year to year:
:Winter period 1905/06 - 10 sowing machines
:Autumn 1906 - 20 pieces
:Winter period 1906/07 - 40 machines
:1907 - 60 pieces
:Winter period 1907/08 - 254 sowing machines.

Since 1905 Glas had a branch office in [[Dingolfing]]. He started to produce in Dingolfing in 1908 with 150 sowing machines per year. The production count rose each year.

After [[World War II]], the market for sowing machines was getting smaller and smaller. So the company had to decide what it would produce in the future. It decided to build little [[carrow]]s and later working machines for [[baker]]s next to the sowing machines.

==Products==
[[File:Goggomobil-1.jpg|thumb|Goggomobil TS 250 Coupe.]]Glas were known for small cars like the [[Goggomobil]]. However in 1964 the company introduced the Glas 1300GT coupe and later the 1700GT. The body was designed by [[Pietro Frua]]. However competition, mostly from British cars, was tough and in 1966 released the 2600GT powered by a [[SOHC]] [[V8]] engine, with a volume just under 2.6 litres. However this didn't help and later the same year the company was sold to [[BMW]]. The Glas models were kept in production by BMW, but fitted with BMW engines. The Glas 1300 GT coupe was fitted with a 1.6 litre BMW engine and renamed BMW 1600 GT. BMW also fitted a 3 litre engine and named it 3000 GT. This model kept the Glas name, but had a BMW logo in the front and rear. In 1968 BMW created their own large coupe, the BMW 2500 CS, and this meant the end for Glas. 277 copies of 2600 GT was made and 389 of the 3000 GT.

===Scooters===
In 1951 Andreas Glas made a trip to [[Verona, Italy]] where he saw the [[Vespa]] [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] from Piaggio. He was so enthused he began production of his own motorscooter in that July.

The scooter debuted with a 125 [[cubic centimetre|cc]] motor, increased in time to 150 cc and 200 cc. Up until 1956 46,181 motor scooters were built. Then production of scooters stopped because of the Goggomobil cars. From 1953 on, load-carrying scooters were built as well. They had the 200 cc engine and 9.5 [[Horsepower#Brake horsepower (bhp)|bhp]]. They were able to carry 250 kg.

==Absorption by BMW==
In 1962 BMW released the [[BMW 1500]]. The popular four-door compact's success exhausted the production capacity of the [[Munich]] plant.  In 1966 management decided to buy Glas and absorb the Glas model line.<ref name=Autocar196610>{{cite journal | authorlink = Maurice A Smith (Ed)|title = BMW take over Glas| journal =[[Autocar]]| volume = vol 125 nbr 3689| pages = page 955| date = 28 October 1966}}</ref> 

===Changes under BMW===
* The 04-type, the GT and the 1700 sedan were given BMW badges in the last year of their production.
* The GT was reengineered and so it was built with a BMW engine and rear axle and sold as BMW 1600 GT until 1968.
* The V8 got a bigger engine constructed by Glas and was also sold until 1968 as BMW-GLAS 3000 V8.
* The 1700 sedan was built and sold by a [[South Africa]]n importer with several changes as BMW 1800 SA until 1974.

===Closure===
In the late 60s BMW shut down Glas and built entirely new production facilities which would eventually become a very important production site. As of 2008, BMW's Dingolfing branch is the largest factory of BMW worldwide, with 22,000 workers producing both thirteen hundred 5-, 6- and 7-series cars and bodies for [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]].
