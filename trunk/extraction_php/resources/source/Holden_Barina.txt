The '''Holden Barina''' is a [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] [[automobile]] sold since 1985 by [[Holden]], the [[Australian]] arm of [[General Motors]] (GM). Each of the five generations have been badge-engineered versions of GM vehicles: [[Suzuki Cultus]], [[Opel Corsa]], and [[Daewoo Kalos]].

== First generation (MB, ML; 1985–1988) ==
{{main|Suzuki Cultus}}

[[File:1985-1986 Holden MB Barina hatchback 01.jpg|thumb|left|1985–1986 Holden MB Barina hatchback.]]

The first generation '''MB Barina''' was launched in 1985 as a badge-engineered [[Suzuki Cultus]] as a five-door [[hatchback]]. In the first year of production a [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]] special model was offered complete with decals showing the [[Warner Bros.]] [[cartoon]] character. A high-profile marketing campaign featured the slogan ''Beep beep Barina'', a catchphrase that remains in the consciousness of many Australians in the present. The mildy facelifted '''ML Barina''' was released in September 1986.

In the Used Car Safety Ratings undertaken by the [[Monash University]] Accident Research Centre, published in 2008, found that the first generation Barina provides a "significantly worse than average" level of occupant [[Automobile safety|safety protection]] in the event of an [[Car accident|accident]].<ref name = "Used Car Safety Ratings">{{cite web | url = http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/safety/publications/2008/pdf/ucsr_08.pdf | format = PDF | title = Used Car Safety Ratings 2008 | publisher = [[Monash University]] | accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref>  Achieving up to 19km/l on the 1.0 3-cyl models, the fuel consumption on this model is outstanding.

In New Zealand, from 1986 to 1989, a Holden Barina GTi model was also sold, being a rebadged Suzuki Swift Gti (see [[Suzuki Cultus]] - Generation 1).  This vehicle used the [[Suzuki_G_engine|G13B]] engine.

== Second generation (MF, MH; 1988–1994) ==
[[File:1991-1994 Holden MH Barina 5-door hatchback 06.jpg|thumb|1991–1994 Holden MH Barina 5-door hatchback.]]

{{main|Suzuki Cultus}}

The second-generation '''MF Barina''' was a rebadged second generation [[Suzuki Cultus]], co-developed with GM using the [[GM M platform]] and marketed worldwide under nearly a dozen nameplates, prominently as the [[Suzuki Cultus|Suzuki Swift]], [[Pontiac Firefly]] (Canada) and [[Geo Metro]] (Chevrolet's sub-model in the USA). A three-door hatchback was first released in 1988, and was followed by the introduction of a five-door hatchback in 1990. A facelifted '''MH Barina''' was released in October 1991.

Like the previous generation, the second generation Barina provides a "worse than average" level of safety according to the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings.<ref name = "Used Car Safety Ratings"/>

== Third generation (SB; 1994–2001) ==

{{main|Opel Corsa}}

The third generation '''SB Barina''' was based on the [[Opel Corsa|Opel Corsa B]] and imported from [[Spain]]. It was released in 1994 and was offered as a three- or five-door [[hatchback]]. Engine choices were a 1.2 and 1.4&nbsp;litre four-cylinder engine. A 1.6&nbsp;litre engine was also offered for the sporty range topping GSi. The second generation was available in the following models:
*1.2&nbsp;litre SB City 3-door
*1.4&nbsp;litre SB City 3-door
*1.4&nbsp;litre SB Joy 3-door
*1.4&nbsp;litre SB Swing 5-door
*1.4&nbsp;litre SB Grand Prix 5-door ([[special edition]])
*1.6&nbsp;litre 16V SB GSi 3-door
*1.4&nbsp;litre SB Lambada 3-door ([[special edition]])
*1.4&nbsp;litre SB Olympic Edition 3-door and 5-door ([[special edition]])
*1.4&nbsp;litre SB Equipe 3-door and 5-door ([[special edition]])
*1.4&nbsp;litre SB Cabrio

In late 1998 there was an update featuring multipoint fuel injection across the range and suspension upgrades to improve ride and handling. These models can be identified by their half body coloured bumpers and 3 bar grille. In 2001, Holden issued a voluntary recall of all Barina SB models, built between 1994 and 2001. This was due to a faulty seatbelt mounting on front bucket seats.

In the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings, the SB Barina was assessed as providing an "average" protection.<ref name = "Used Car Safety Ratings"/>

== Fourth generation (XC; 2001–2005) ==
{{main|Opel Corsa}}

[[File:2004-2005 Holden XC Barina 3-door hatchback 01.jpg|thumb|right|2004–2005 Holden XC Barina 3-door hatchback.]]

The fourth-generation '''XC Barina''' was released in April 2001, based on the [[Opel Corsa|Opel Corsa C]]. It was available in Barina 3 Door and Barina 5 Door models with a 1.4&nbsp;litre [[16-valve]] engine. In September of that year an SRi model with a new 1.8&nbsp;litre engine joined the line-up. The Barina was awarded the ''[[Wheels Car of the Year]]'' award for 2001.

In 2003 a decision by [[Peter Hanenberger]] (then Holden's managing director) led to the importation of higher-spec SXi three-door and the CD five-door models, to boost sales. The SRi remained unchanged. These newer models did not provide a boost to sales in the face of increasing pricing competition in the market. In 2004, the 1.4&nbsp;litre models were downgraded, reverting back to their original Barina 3 Door and Barina 5 Door model names.

In the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings the XC Barina was rated as providing an "better than average" level of occupant protection in the event of an accident,<ref name = "Used Car Safety Ratings"/> with [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] rating the model four out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ltsa.govt.nz/vehicles/ancap/holden/barina-city-2001.html | title = Holden Barina City <nowiki>|</nowiki> 2001 | work = Land Transport New Zealand | publisher = [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]] | accessdate = 2008-04-10}}</ref>

== Fifth generation (TK; 2005–present) ==
{{main|Daewoo Kalos}}

[[File:2005-2008 Holden TK Barina 3-door hatchback 04.jpg|thumb|2005–2008 Holden TK Barina 3-door hatchback.]]
[[File:2009 Holden TK Barina (MY10) 3-door hatchback 01.jpg|thumb|2009 Holden TK Barina (MY10) 3-door hatchback.]]

In December 2005 Holden dropped the Opel-sourced Barina and rebadged the [[Daewoo Kalos]] hatchback as the fifth generation '''TK Barina'''. In February 2006, a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] went on sale, the first sedan type for the Barina nameplate. It is also equipped with a 1.6&nbsp;litre twin-cam 16-valve variation. The decision was made to ensure Holden remains highly competitive in the fast-growing small car market in Australia, facing competition from other [[South Korea]]n-sourced models like the [[Hyundai Getz]]. The Opel-sourced model sold at a loss and was sold to build up a presence in the entry-level new car market in Australia.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2006-01-14 | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/site/research/story/new_barinas_price_calms_sentiment/ | title = New Barina's price calms sentiment | work = [[The Courier-Mail]] | publisher = [[News Limited]] | accessdate = 2008-04-10}}</ref> The Holden Barina was sold at AU$12,990 for a base model car, which was later changed to AU$13,490, due to high demand.

The Daewoo-sourced Holden Barina scored a lower two out of five star [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] rating than its European-built, Opel-based predecessor.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2006-05-16 | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/5/holden-barina-korean-safety/ | title = Holden Barina Korean Safety | publisher = CarAdvice.com.au | accessdate = 2008-04-10}}</ref> Criticism was focused on the Barina TK because of these crash test results, one of the worst in history.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ltsa.govt.nz/vehicles/ancap/holden/barina-2005.html | title = Holden Barina <nowiki>|</nowiki> 2005 on | work = Land Transport New Zealand | publisher = [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]] | accessdate = 2008-04-10}}</ref> As a result, [[Denny Mooney]], the managing director of Holden,  was forced to publicly defend his product.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2006-05-14 | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/250/holden-barina-2006-poor-safety-slows-sales/ | title = Holden Barina 2006 Poor Safety Slows Sales | publisher = CarAdvice.com.au | accessdate = 2008-04-10}}</ref> Holden has gone on the record stating that "safety is not a concern in this segment and sales have proven this, therefore we will not be importing the Opel Barina" as quoted by Holden marketing executive Jason Laird.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

Reflecting market priorities and price point control, some safety equipment is either unavailable or available only at extra cost on some models in some markets—including side airbags, [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]], fog lamps and a rear center position three-point seatbelts and headrests. So while the Holden Barina is itself a virtually identical iteration of the [[Daewoo Kalos]] and all its iterations—its safety content may differ critically from other market variations of the vehicle.  

The updated TK Barina hatchback was released in August 2008. It has been facelifted with a bolder grille, new headlamps and tail lamps, along with the interior seen on the sedan model introduced in 2006. Power windows and electric mirrors were standardised in the updated Barina’s specification. Safety-wise, side-impact air bags have been included as standard fitment to the dual front air bags already fitted.<ref>{{cite web | last = Mathioudakis | first = Bryon | date = 2008-08-15 | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/3447A7E3825F030FCA2574A6001B4D0C | title = Holden’s public web site reveals images and some spec details of the ’09 Barina | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2008-08-20}}</ref> As a result of this, and structural improvements including a high-strength steel reinforced [[B-pillar]], [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] rated the car four out of five stars, up from two.<ref>{{cite web | last = Blackburn | first = Richard | date = 2008-11-06 | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=58483 | title = Holden Barina improves crash rating | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}</ref>{{-}}
