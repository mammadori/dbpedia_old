The '''Rolls-Royce Ghost''' is a new, smaller [[luxury]] [[Saloon (car)|saloon]] [[automobile]] from [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars]]. The "Ghost" nameplate, named in honour of the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost|Silver Ghost]], a car first produced in 1906, was announced in April 2009 at the [[Auto Shanghai]] show.<ref>{{cite web |author=Wes Siler | title=Rolls-Royce Ghost Is The New RR4 |url=http://jalopnik.com/5219471/rolls+royce-ghost-is-the-new-rr4 |publisher=[[Jalopnik]] | date=20Apr09 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref><ref name="Economist0509"/> During development, the Ghost was known as the "RR04." Designed aiming for a lower price category for Rolls models, the expected retail price will be around £170,000 (US$255,000). <ref name="Economist0509">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13611109|title=Rolls-Royce:Keep on rolling|publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=2009-05-07 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref> The production model was officially unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.

== Design ==
[[File:Rolls-Royce Ghost Heck.JPG|thumb|left|Rear with the door open.]]
The Ghost was designed by Ian Cameron and engineered by [[Helmut Riedl]], who led the development of the fifth-generation [[Rolls-Royce Phantom]].<ref>{{cite web|author=19 February 2009 |url=http://autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/238333/ |title=Rolls-Royce 200EX: full details |publisher=Autocar |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> The Ghost, codenamed RR4 during its design phase, was developed to compete with vehicles significantly less expensive than the Phantom, such as the [[Maserati Quattroporte]] and [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur]].

The Ghost will borrow 20% of its parts from the BMW [[BMW F01|F01]] platform underpinning the current [[BMW 7 Series]]. The car has a wheelbase, roof height, bonnet height and track widths all of its own. The parts supplied by BMW will be used in functional places unseen by the driver. Rolls-Royce has stated that the engine will be a twin-turbo 6.6-litre V12 producing 574&nbsp;hp mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The car is expected to weigh around 2300&nbsp;kg.<ref>[http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/230570/# Autocar World exclusive: Rolls-Royce 'RR4' spied]</ref>

== 200EX concept ==
[[File:Rolls Royce 200EX Concept.jpg|thumb|Rolls-Royce 200EX.]]
The original concept car, named the 200EX, was officially unveiled at the March 2009 [[Geneva Motor Show]], indicating the styling direction of the production model Ghost.

Unlike the aluminum-bodied Phantom, the 200EX will be made from steel, which has a higher tensile strength and can therefore be made thinner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/rolls-royce-200-ex-2009-02-20 |title=Rolls Royce 200EX news - How one Rolls - 2009 - BBC Top Gear |publisher=Topgear.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> The chassis will use an intelligent four corner air suspension system and multi-link aluminium front and rear axles. Systems such as Active Roll Stabilisation, four corner air springs and Variable Damping Control operate as one, imperceptibly to the driver and passengers to provide the best possible comfort for occupants. An all new and extremely sensitive air suspension connected to the main computer will detect the movement of a single rear passenger from one side of the seat to the other, and will compensate accordingly. <ref>[http://www.inautonews.com/the-ghost-the-best-rolls-ever-produced The Ghost, the best Rolls ever produced]</ref>. Twenty percent of all components are shared with BMW Group cars, including the electronics. Some of the shared chassis components come from the BMW 7 Series, but the 200EX uses Phantom-style air springs.

The engine is a 6.6 litre twin-turbo V12 rated {{convert|571|bhp|kW||abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/First-Official-Pictures/Rolls-Royce-200EX-first-official-photos-of-baby-Roller/ |title=Rolls-Royce 200EX: first official photos of baby Roller &#124; Automotive & Motoring News &#124; Car Magazine Online |publisher=Carmagazine.co.uk |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> with ZF 8-speed automatic transmission.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/23/confirmed-rolls-royce-rr4-getting-500-hp-turbo-v12-8-speed-gea/ CONFIRMED: Rolls-Royce RR4 getting 500+HP turbo V12, 8-speed gearbox]</ref> This engine will allow the Ghost to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 4.7, and has an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/09/15/rolls-royce-ghost-unveiled-at-frankfurt-motor-show/|title=Rolls Royce Ghost Unveiled At Frankfurt Motor Show|publisher=Automoblog.net}}</ref>

== Manufacturing ==
The Rolls-Royce Ghost will be built in its own dedicated production line at Goodwood but will share paint, wood and leather workshops with the Phantom series.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/20/shanghai-2009-rolls-royce-ditches-rr4-for-ghost-nameplate/ Shanghai 2009: Rolls-Royce ditches RR4 for Ghost nameplate]</ref>
