A '''dune buggy''' is a recreational [[vehicle]] with large [[wheel]]s, and wide [[tire]]s, designed for use on sand [[dune]]s or [[beach]]es. The design is usually a modified vehicle with a modified engine mounted on an open [[chassis]]. The modifications usually attempt to increase the power to weight ratio by either lightening the vehicle or increasing engine power or both. Those with an open frame chassis are called [[sandrail]]s.

A similar, more recent generation of off road vehicle, often similar in appearance to a sand rail but designed for different use, is the "off road [[go kart]]". The difference between a ''dune'' buggy or go kart and an off road buggy or kart is sometimes nothing more than the type of tires fitted — sand tires or all terrain tires.

== Design ==
Dune buggies are usually created using one of two to three different methods.

The first involves alteration of an existing vehicle, most notably the older  [[Volkswagen]] [[Volkswagen Beetle|Type One (Beetle, or Bug)]].  The Beetle is preferred for a variety of reasons.  Most significant is the position of the [[Rear-engine design|rear mounted]] [[Volkswagen air cooled engine|Volkswagen engine]], which with removal of bodywork transfers a high proportion of the weight to the rear driven wheels for extra traction. The engine is air cooled, simplifying engine modification, and the absence of a radiator eliminates a source of failure. The low price; robustness of the front suspension; and the sizable quantity of spare parts from other VW Beetles and [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 buses]] are a further advantage. [[Corvair]] engines are also a popular way to upgrade to 6 cylinders and sometimes vehicles are fitted with turbochargers to provide as much as {{convert|180|hp}}. For example, one such conversion was a 1970 Manx 2 on a 1961 VW chassis. It was fitted with a {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on}} turbocharged Corvair engine, with reverse rotation, mated to a VW [[transaxle]].

The second method involves construction of a vehicle frame from steel tubing formed and welded together. The advantage of this method is that the fabricator can change fundamental parts of the vehicle (usually the suspension and addition of a built-in roll cage). Buggies of this type are called [[sandrail]]s because of the rail frame. Sandrails, as with the VW Bug, often have the engine located behind the driver. Sizes can vary from a small engined one seat size to 4 seat, 8+ cylinder vehicles. Sandrails can have panels or custom shaped body coverings over the rails and tubing that comprise the vehicle, though many are left bare.

The third is only a temporary fix. These dune buggies represent mixes of the above two design philosophies, typically after a converted vehicle sustains damage from age, hard use, or accidents and spare parts are not available or affordable. This type of creation is called [[The Boston-Murphy]] style.

== Function ==
Initially dune buggies were designed for navigating desert or beaches (hence the word "dune").  However, dune buggies have become more diversified in terms of the terrain they can handle and are being built for more generic off road tasks, such as CORR / SCORE indoor track racing.  Some are even built for and used as on-road vehicles.  Typically the function is determined before the buggy is created in order to maximize the comfort or abilities of the vehicle.

Although dune buggies can be bought (as a kit), many drivers make their own. This is done by separately buying chassis, engine, tires, steering wheel, and axles. Some builders make their own chassis, which creates a special, customized vehicle.

A 1961 or later [[Volkswagen]] sedan is the preferred donor to create a Dune Buggy.  The [[VW]] Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4 do not make good donor cars, however the engine, transaxle, wheels, and instruments can be used from these models.

Other parts that can be salvaged from a donor VW for use in a Dune Buggy include the front axle and suspension, frame, pedal assembly, shock absorbers, seats, battery, fuel tank (1961 or later), steering column, brakes, instruments and switches, windshield wiper, horn and emergency flasher unit.

== Driverless cars ==

Some driverless cars have also been made based on a buggy.

== Military buggies ==
Because of the obvious advantages a buggy can afford on some terrain, they are also used by the military. The buggies built for the US military used to be called [[Desert Patrol Vehicle]]s (DPV) or Fast Attack Vehicles (FAV), yet have changed name to [[Light Strike Vehicle]]s. They are used by US [[Navy Seals]], SAS, ... The LSVs are built by [[Chenowth Racing Products Inc.]], a San Diego based company. As with most military material, they are not sold outside the government. The newest version is the ALSV or Advanced Light Strike Vehicle <ref>[http://www.specialoperations.com/Equipment/Vehicles/default.html Advanced Light Strike Vehicle]</ref>

== Tube framed buggies ==
Over time Buggies have been altered to allow maximum recreational use. They are now available in varying sizes.

The most common form of non-racing buggy consists of a 'tube frame' which is simple to construct and sturdy. If the frame bends or breaks it is simple to fix.  Steel tubing is preferred to "pipe" as pipe is rolled and welded, tubing is mandrel drawn, making it stronger and with consistent wall thickness.

Engine size varies depending on the suspension, frame strength and performance needs. Engine size has varied from 50&nbsp;cc for small light buggies to 7+ liter engines designed for professional racing. Dune buggies use both automatic or manual transmissions, sometimes based on application and engine power, but often based simply on personal choice.

== Fiberglass dune buggies ==
Dune buggies with [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (fiberglass) bodies come in many shapes and sizes. Many companies worldwide have attempted to copy the original fiberglass dune buggy, the "[[Meyers Manx]]" built by Bruce Meyers. They can be seen on TV shows such as ''[[Wonderbug]]'' and ''[[Speed Buggy]]''. These types of dune buggies are known as "clones". 

Kit cars are a variant that use the dune buggy philosophy of substituting significant amounts of a car with custom parts to resemble production, modified, or [[prototype]] cars. For instance: American Fiberglass Product’s “Humbug” has similar features to a classic Corvette, Berry’s “Mini-T” was a nod to the [[Ford]] [[Model T]], or BMB Automotive’s “Surviver” is a scaled down version of the [[Lamborghini Cheetah]].
