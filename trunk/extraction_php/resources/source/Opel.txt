'''Adam Opel [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]]''', commonly known as '''Opel''', is a [[Germany|German]] [[automaker]]. The company was founded on 21 January 1863, began making [[automobile]]s in 1899, and was acquired by [[General Motors]] in 1929.<ref>[http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/company/c_history/2000/index.html "1929, Adam Opel Corporation Joins the GM Family" in ''GM Media Online Opel International''].</ref> As part of [[GM Europe]], Opel is GM's largest European brand and, along with [[Vauxhall Motors]] in the [[UK]], it forms GM's core European business.<ref>[http://www.gm.com/europe/corporate/about/l "About GM Europe" in ''General Motors - GM Europe - Company Overview''].</ref>

In early 2009, the future of Opel was thrown into uncertainty as the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009|global financial crisis]] drove GM towards bankruptcy. New Opel (Opel plus Vauxhall, minus [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]),<ref name="apps.detnews.com">{{cite web|url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/blogs/autosblog/index.php?blogid=788&source=nletter-business |title=DETNEWS &#124; Weblogs &#124; Autos Blog |publisher=Apps.detnews.com |date=2009-06-14 |accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref> is presently controlled by a trustee, with a controlling board made up of representatives from GM, employees and the German Government; the company was subject to a bidding process.

On 10th September 2009, it was announced that [[Magna International|Magna]], a [[Canadian]] automobile parts manufacturer, and [[Sberbank]], a Russian bank, would buy a majority stake (55%) in its European Opel/Vauxhall operations.  GM would own 35% of Opel; while Opel employees will own 10%.  The agreement would have kept Opel/Vauxhall a fully integrated part of GM’s global product development organization.

However, on 3 November 2009, the GM board called off the Magna deal after coming to the conclusion that Opel/Vauxhall was crucial to GM's global strategy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Business/General-Motors-Scraps-Vauxhall-And-Opel-Sale-Ending-Magna-Deal/Article/200911115432604|title=General Motors Scraps Vauxhall, Opel Sale| date=2009-11-03| publisher=Sky News}}</ref> On the other hand, this resulted in anger among German officials and Opel employees due to the fact that GM will now have to layoff about 20 percent of Opel’s workforce for restructuring Opel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&sid=aeZq416Vj.4c |title=GM Battles Worker, German Resistance in Opel Rescue (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2009-11-04}}<!--accessed 2009-11-24--></ref>  The news was however received differently by Opel's sister company Vauxhall, whose workforce generally welcomed the decision as a positive move that would safeguard the future of GM's British assembly plants. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1225088/Turmoil-thousands-Vauxhall-workers-General-Motors-pulls-plug-sale.html |title=Turmoil for thousands of Vauxhall workers as General Motors pulls plug on sale &#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-11-06}} <!--accessed 2009-11-24--></ref>

==History==
The company was founded in [[Rüsselsheim]] on 21 January 1863 by [[Adam Opel]]. At the beginning, Opel just produced [[sewing machine]]s in a cowshed in Rüsselsheim. Above all, his success was based on his perfectly customized sewing machines. Because of the quick growth of his business, in 1888 the production was relocated from the cowshed to a more spacious building in Rüsselsheim. 
Encouraged by success, Adam Opel launched a new product in 1886: He began to sell high-wheel bicycles, also known as [[penny-farthing]]s. Besides, Opel's two sons participated in high-wheel bicycle races and thus promoted this means of transportation. Therefore, the production of high-wheel bicycles soon exceeded the production of sewing machines.<ref>[http://www.autoscout24.de/modelle/opel/ Informationen zu Opel]</ref>  At the time of Opel's death in 1895, he was the leader in both markets.

The first cars were produced in 1899 after Opel's sons entered into a partnership with Friedrich Lutzmann, a locksmith at the court in [[Dessau]] in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], who had been working on automobile designs for some time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartype.com/pages/1444/lutzmann |title=Lutzmann |publisher=Cartype |date= |accessdate=2009-06-13}}</ref> These cars were not very successful and so the partnership was dissolved after two years, following which Opel's sons signed a licensing agreement with the French [[Automobiles Darracq S.A.]] to manufacture vehicles under the brand name "Opel-Darracq". These cars were made up of Opel bodies mounted on a Darracq chassis, powered by a 2-cylinder engine.

The company first showed cars of its own design at the 1902 [[Hamburg]] [[Auto show|Motor Show]], and started manufacturing them in 1906, with Opel-Darracq production being discontinued in 1907.

In 1911, the company's factory was virtually destroyed by fire and a new one was built with more up-to-date machinery. In the same year, production of sewing machines ended. By 1913, Opel had become the largest car maker in Germany, and in 1924 it installed Germany's first car production line.

In March 1929 General Motors, impressed by Opel's modern production facilities, bought 80% of the company, increasing this to 100% in 1931. The Opel family gained $33.3 million from the transaction. Subsequently, a second factory was built at [[Brandenburg (town)|Brandenburg]] for the production of "Blitz" (~"Lightning") light trucks.

Bicycle production ended in 1937 and, following the outbreak of [[World War II]], the company's factories were seized by the [[Nazi]] regime in 1940. Passenger car production did not resume until 1947, before which the factories had been badly damaged by [[Allied bombing]]s, and production assets for the [[Opel Kadett]] had been seized by the Soviets as war reparations. This Kadett was the basis for the Soviet [[Moskvitch 400/420]] automobile design.

GM regained control of Opel in 1948, and the Rüsselsheim factory was rebuilt in 1950. In 1962, the company's 100th year, a new factory was opened in [[Bochum]], initially for production of the revived Kadett.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mantaworld.com/opel-manta-history/the-opel-story.php |title=The History of Opel - MantaWorld - Opel Manta, Opel Mantas |publisher=MantaWorld |date=1948-11-01 |accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref> By 1972, Opel was once again Germany's largest car maker.

In 1982, another new factory was opened in [[Figueruelas]], [[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]], [[Aragon]], Spain, initially for production of the [[Opel Corsa]].

==Opel worldwide==
[[Image:Opel GT1900 3.jpg|thumb|right|Opel GT1900]]
Many cars sold by General Motors worldwide are Opel vehicles, including such models as the [[Opel Corsa|Corsa]], [[Opel Astra|Astra]], [[Opel Vectra|Vectra]] and [[Opel Omega|Omega]]. Opel models are also sold under other GM brand names, such as Vauxhall in the UK, [[Buick]] in China and North America and [[Chevrolet]] in [[Latin America]]. Its [[Opel Zafira|Zafira]] [[Minivan|people carrier]] was sold in [[Japan]] badged as a [[Opel Zafira|Subaru Traviq]], while the Omega was sold in the [[United States|US]] as the [[Cadillac Catera]] for model years 1997 to 2001. Other models sold in the US, but slightly modified, include the [[Saturn L-Series]], [[Chevrolet Malibu]] and [[Chevrolet Cobalt|Cobalt]]. The majority of future Saturn models are expected to be either identical to (like the [[Saturn Astra]] and [[Saturn Sky|Sky]]) or closely based on (like the [[Saturn Aura|Aura]] and 2008 [[Saturn Vue]]) European Opels. The [[Pontiac LeMans]] (1989–1994) – the first car produced by [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]] for export to North America – was based on the [[Opel Kadett|Opel Kadett E]] (now Astra).

Opels appeared under their own name in the USA from 1958 to 1975, when they were sold through [[Buick]] dealers as [[captive import]]s. The best-selling Opel models in the US were the 1964–1972 [[Opel Kadett]], the 1971–1975 [[Opel Manta]], and the now-classic 1968-1973 [[Opel GT]].<ref>[http://www.opelclub.com/ Opel Club]</ref><ref>[http://www.opelgt.com Opel GT]</ref>  (The name "Opel" was also applied from 1976 to 1980 on vehicles manufactured by [[Isuzu]] (similar to the "Isuzu I-mark"), but mechanically those were entirely different cars).

Opel was long GM's strongest marque in Japan, with sales peaking at 38,000 in 1996. However, the brand diminished in the following decade, and was withdrawn at the end of 2006 after sales had fallen to just 1,800 in 2005.

In some markets outside Europe, the Opel brand name has been used on other GM products, for example, the [[Chevrolet Blazer]] was sold in [[Indonesia]] as the '''Opel Blazer''', while in the mid-1990s, a version of the [[Holden Commodore]] was sold as the '''Opel Calais''' in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

=== Opel in Europe ===

Opel is the main GM brand name in Europe except in the UK, where GM's other European subsidiary, Vauxhall Motors, still uses its own "Vauxhall" brand name.  In other [[right hand drive]] markets in Europe, like [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]], the main GM brand name is now Opel.  However, many Vauxhall cars are imported second hand from the UK and sold in Ireland. Some have suggested that the Vauxhall name should be dropped altogether in favour of Opel, thereby harmonising GM's marketing strategy across Europe.<ref>[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article6401606.ece Opel ‘will be brand name to attract Russian buyers’], [[The Times]]. June 1, 2009.</ref> Vauxhall has rejected this on the grounds that its brand is well known and, in the eighties, there was a preference among fleet buyers, the main customer base at the time, for the Vauxhall brand.  Similar to the Vauxhall situation, Opel also provides design and engineering to the American [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] marque.

[[Image:Bochum Opel.jpg|thumb|right|The Opel factory in Bochum]]
The company headquarters and the largest factory are located in [[Rüsselsheim]]. Other plants are in [[Bochum]], [[Eisenach]], and [[Kaiserslautern]], Germany; [[Figueruelas]], [[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]], [[Spain]]; [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]; and [[Gliwice]], [[Poland]].  Opel cars are also made in Vauxhall's [[Ellesmere Port]] plant in the UK.

In October 2004 employees went on [[strike action|strike]] for six days due to the threat of 12,000 job losses. The threat was due to the unprofitable European markets because of low customer demand. The strike had a major impact on production.

In 2006, the [[Azambuja]], [[Portugal]] factory shut down and production of the [[Opel Combo]] transferred to Zaragoza. The move prompted a national boycott and caused the Portuguese government to [[lawsuit|sue]] GM.

GM announced in April 2008 that it would invest €9 billion by 2012 in a bid to stop the market share erosion of the Opel brand in Europe. Approximately €6.5 billion is to be dedicated for the development of new models and engines, with the plants in Rüsselsheim, Bochum, and Kaiserslautern slated to be modernized.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200804301226DOWJONESDJONLINE001004_FORTUNE5.html "GM Europe Plans EUR9 Billion Invest Into Opel By 2012" in ''CNNMoney.com''], April 30, 2008.</ref>

For many years, Opel sponsored the [[fifa world cup]] from [[Spain 82]] up until [[France 98]]. Opel also sponsored Ireland's [[football (soccer)|football]] team, using the [[slogan]] ''Ireland's Number One Supporter''. Opel was also the main sponsor of [[FC Bayern München]] for some time, a club with a high profile but also an important marketing ploy for the company in the heartland of [[BMW]]. Indeed, the [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] is directly overlooked by the BMW headquarters.

===New GM Europe===
{{Main|New GM Europe}}
Following the global financial crisis, and GM's plunge towards bankruptcy, on May 30, 2009, it was announced that a deal had been reached to transfer [[New GM Europe]] (Opel plus Vauxhall, minus [[Saab Automobile|Saab]])<ref name="apps.detnews.com"/> assets to a separate company, controlled by a trustee.

The deal, underwritten by the [[German Government]], was negotiated by [[German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]. GM was expected to keep a 35% minority stake in the new company,<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany picks Magna to save Opel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8074924.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=May 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Weber |title=Analysis: Opel's survival still at stake |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8075157.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=May 30, 2009}}</ref> with a plan which proposed to sell the majority of the business to one of two partners:
*[[FIAT]]
*A consortium majority-owned by a [[Sberbank]] of Russia (35%), [[Magna International]] of Canada (20%), and Opel employees and car dealers (10%)

On June 1, 2009, GM filed for bankruptcy in a court in [[New York]]. As the sale of Opel and Vauxhall had been negotiated two days before, with the preferred bidder the Magna consortium, both companies were in effect ring-fenced from any GM asset liquidation.<ref name = "Bloomberg-Sandler-et al-2009-06-01">

GM announced that final bids were to be placed with them by July 20, which resulted in three bidders:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8158569.stm|title=GM receives three bids for Opel|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-07-20}} <!--accessed 2009-07-20--></ref>
*Magna, still backed by Sberbank, had made a last-minute change to its bid in order to placate concerns about its Russian partner's influence. This resulted in both partners having a 27.5% share in the new company, with GM retaining 35%
*Belgian-based investor RHJ International
*China's [[Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Corporation|Beijing Automotive Industries]]

Towards the end of August 2009 there were doubts over whether a sale of GM Europe would actually go ahead, though a German government official later revealed that talks were continuing.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8219542.stm GM 'still intends to sell Opel'] [[BBC News]]. 25 August 2009</ref> This was followed by RHJ International raising its bid for Opel to €300m from €275m.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8233945.stm RHJ raises bid for carmaker Opel] [[BBC News]]. 2 September 2009</ref>

On 10 September 2009, GM announced its intention to sell its European operation to the Magna group with the approval of the German government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8247971.stm|title=Opel and Vauxhall to go to Magna|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-09-10}} <!--accessed 2009-09-10--></ref> However, on 3 November 2009, the GM board called off the Magna deal after coming to the conclusion that Opel was crucial to GM's global strategy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8341485.stm |title=Business &#124; General Motors cancels Opel sale |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-04}} <!--accessed 2009-11-24--></ref>  However, Opel will still need restructuring. According to [[Carl-Peter Forster]], GM’s top executive in Europe, GM will have to eliminate 10,000 jobs in order to cut capacity and make Opel viable. This will result in laying off about 20 percent of Opel’s 50,000- strong workforce.

==Opel logo==
[[Image:Opel-z-37.jpg|thumb|Zeppelin 1937 logo]]
The lightning bolt on the Opel badging is a reference to the famous Opel Blitz truck (the German word "Blitz" means lightning or flash). The logo was originally a [[Zeppelin]], which became more stylized, and as the Zeppelin became less popular as a form of transport, the logo was changed. There is also a noticeable similarity between the winged Zeppelin and the lightning logo.<ref>[http://www.cartype.com/page.cfm?id=251&keyword=opel "Opel Logo" in ''Cartype'']</ref>

Starting with the [[Opel Insignia]], the Blitz logo will be updated. The border that is circling the lightning bolt will be wider to incorporate the Opel name, and the surfaces will be more spherical to give the logo a three-dimensional look.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=81&docid=45888 |title=GM Media Online |publisher=Media.gm.com |date=2008-05-20}} <!--accessed 2009-04-29--></ref>
