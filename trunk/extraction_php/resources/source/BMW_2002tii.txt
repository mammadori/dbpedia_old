The '''BMW 2002tii''' was the high performance, [[fuel injection|fuel injected]], limited edition of [[BMW]]'s [[BMW 2002|2002]] [[automobile]] model line. It was a two door sports [[sedan (car)|sedan]] based on the four door [[BMW 1500]] of 1961.

==Background==

The BMW 2002 series is important in the history of BMW for several reasons, none the least of which it brought the company out of near bankruptcy in the 1950s and put BMW as a marque on the map in the United States.  It was the ancestral grandfather to the [[BMW 3 Series]] and was produced from 1968 to 1976.

Today, German BMW importer [[Max Hoffman]] is credited for the car's creation, and indeed it was his very own idea. He had suggested to BMW's engineering director that a 2.0 L engine should be installed into the small two-door 1600-2 to improve performance and emissions. The engineering director argued that the larger motor would not fit, but Hoffman countered that it certainly would fit; if he refused to put the motor in, Hoffman would personally take a car with the new engine to [[Georg Meier]], a famous motorcycle racer, for installation. Almost immediately, this brought action, and the resulting 2002 (named after the new motor's displacement) was popular in its first year on sale stateside.

BMW's 2002 Series is credited for inventing the category for compact sporting sedans, a category 
widely popular now through models from various German, Japanese and American makes of small 2-door sedans with high performance engines, suspensions and aggressive [[sports car]]-like features.

==Overview==

The 2002tii is considered by many to be the most desirable '02 produced by BMW and imported to the United States.  Compared to a standard 2002, a tii offers greater performance and overall value.  Thus, a 2002tii is usually worth more, and therefore, more highly touted. 

Since the last U.S. tii's were made in 1974, finding one in good shape without owner modifications has grown increasingly difficult.  This is especially true considering the tii's mechanical uniqueness and the cost of replacement parts.  Furthermore, since the 2002 is a "tinkerer's car," many owners have upgraded their regular 2002s with tii hardware to increase performance. 

Likewise, tii owners sometimes strip their cars of original tii items, such as the [[Kugelfischer]] mechanical fuel injection system in favor of cheaper (but not necessarily better) [[carburetor]]s. These factors can cause some confusion for a prospective tii buyer.

===VIN information===

The [[vehicle identification number]] is found on the metal plate under the hood, on top of the inner fender, behind the upper shock mount on the right side.  It is in plain view, and should be easy to spot. On this plate, it will identify the car as a 2002 TII for 1972-73 cars.  1974 cars share the same identification plate as the standard 2002, so the plate will read 2002/2002tii USA. The VIN is the long number which is stamped into that plate. 

For 1972-1973 U.S. tiis, the VIN will begin with 276, running from 2760001 (the first '72) to 2764522 (the last '73).  1974 tii's begin with 278, running from 2780001 to 2782929. This number should match the number stamped into the flange on the right front wheel housing itself, next to the fender, behind the hood lock bar, as well as the number stamped into the metal plate on top of the steering column. If the car still has its original engine block, the [[engine number]] on the block, above the starter mounting flange, will match the VIN.

If one were to specifically look for a tii model, and prefer one in original condition, it behooves you to try and purchase a car with this system intact and functioning. The Kugelfischer injection system is the tii's distinctive feature, and along with the higher compression ratio the Kugelfischer gives it a combination of midrange torque and top end power. The lower front aluminum engine timing cover and alternator mounting location are different from a normal 2002, as well. tii's also have an extra fitting on the intake side of the engine block for an injection pump oil return line as well as an extra fitting on the oil filter head for the injection pump oil feed line.

Finally, an original [[BMW E12|E12]] 2002tii cylinder head (late '72-'74 cars) will have no fuel pump mounting holes on it for a standard 2002 mechanical fuel pump. 121/121TI head equipped '72 tiis will have the mounting holes, but with the center pushrod hole plugged. The fuel pump mounting holes are used to mount the intake plenum on '72 cars.

===Brakes===

The first clue to this may also be found in the engine compartment. Under the hood, the tii has a larger diameter (23 mm vs. 20 mm) master cylinder, and a longer brake booster. The dimensions of this larger booster are: 6 inches (152 mm) length and 7 inches (178 mm) diameter.

Under the car, the tii has larger front brake discs, which measure 10.08 inches (256 mm) in diameter vs. 9.45 in (240 mm) for the standard 2002. These are accompanied by larger calipers and pads, as well as larger hubs and spindles. The rear drums are the same size as a normal '02, but the wheel cylinders are larger (17 mm vs. 15 mm). In the rear, the trailing arms of tii are boxed, for increased stiffness (instead of the standard C-section).

===Clock===

Inside the car, a clock should be present. It is located on the left most end of the parcel tray.

===Boot-Lid emblem===

On the rear of the car above the right taillight is the 2002tii emblem or badge. On the original '72-'73 tiis the wheels are 1/2 in (13 mm) wider, and all of this width is added onto the outside of the wheel, resulting in wheel covers that appear to be set in further.
