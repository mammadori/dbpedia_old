'''August Horch''' ([[12 October]], [[1868]] &ndash; [[3 February]], [[1951]]) was a German [[engineer]] and [[automobile]] [[Innovator|pioneer]], the founder of the manufacturing giant which would eventually become [[Audi]]. 
==Beginnings==
Horch was born in [[Winningen]], [[Moselle]] and was educated in [[Mittweida]].  August Horch worked for [[Karl Benz]] from 1896, before founding ''[[A. Horch & Cie]]'' in November 1899, in Ehrenfeld, [[Cologne, Germany]].

==Manufacturing==
The first [[Horch]] automobile was built in 1901.  The company moved to [[Reichenbach]] in 1902 and [[Zwickau]] in 1904.  Horch left the company in 1909 after a dispute, and set up in competition in Zwickau.  His new firm was initially called ''Horch Automobil-Werke GmbH'', but following a legal dispute over the ''Horch'' name, he was obliged to change the company name.  (The court decided that ''Horch'' was a registered trademark on behalf of August Horch's former partners and August Horch was not entitled to use it any more).  Consequently, Horch renamed his company ''[[Audi Automobilwerke GmbH]]'' in 1910, ''Audi'' being the Latinization of Horch. 
== The Four Rings==
In August 1928, the [[Denmark|Danish]] engineer [[Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen]] of [[DKW]] acquired a majority holding in Audiwerke.  In June 1932 Audi, DKW, Horch and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] merged to form [[Auto Union]] AG, the new company's logo was four interlinked rings, one for each of the founder companies. [[Horch]] was on the supervisory board of Auto Union.
