The '''Porsche Cayman''' is a [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|mid-engined, rear wheel drive]] 2-seat [[sports car]] produced by [[Porsche AG]] of [[Germany]]. First launched in the 2006 [[model year]], the Cayman is a [[coupé]] derived from Porsche's second generation [[Porsche Boxster|Boxster]] convertible. Like the Boxster, most Caymans are assembled in [[Finland]] for Porsche by [[Valmet Automotive]] (the rest are assembled in Zuffenhausen near Stuttgart, Germany).  Porsche's Deputy Chairman, Holger P. Haerter confirmed that their contract with Valmet Automotive will end in 2012, and the Cayman's production will be outsourced to [[Magna Steyr]] Fahrzeugtechnik of Graz, Austria. (Panorama, 2008) <ref name="valmet">{{cite web | url = http://www.metso.com/news/newsdocuments.nsf/webnewsdocprintview/74d6086817f9e775c22574740036862b?opendocument&ch=chmetsowebeng&id=74d6086817f9e775c22574740036862b& | title = Valmet Automotive's current assembly contract with Porsche to come to an end in 2012 | accessdate = 2008-08-04 | author = Kati Renvall | date = 2008-06-26 | publisher = Metso Corporation }}</ref>

==Development==
After two years of development, the first model of the coupé to be released was the '''Cayman S''' (type 987.120). Photographs and technical details were released in May 2005, but the public unveiling did not take place until the September [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. The S suffix (an acronym for Sport<ref>

That model, the '''Cayman''' (987.110), went on sale in July 2006. A motorsport-tuned model, the '''Cayman RS''', is rumored to have been tested at the [[Nürburgring]] that same year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porsche Cayman RS in the works?|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/05/15/porsche-cayman-rs-in-the-works/ |work=Autoblog|accessdate=February 9, 2007}}</ref> 

The Cayman coupé (project 987c) and the second generation [[Boxster]] convertible (project 987) share the same mid-engined platform and many components, including the front fenders and trunk lid, side doors, headlights, tailights and forward portion of the interior. The design of the Cayman's body incorporates styling cues from two classic Porsches; the 550 Coupé and the [[Porsche 904|904 Coupé]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 Porsche Cayman S|url=http://www.sport-cars.org/articles/porsche/porsche-cayman-s.php |work=sport-cars.org|accessdate=February 9, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Test Drive: 2007 Porsche Cayman ‘S’ |url=http://www.champweb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=115&Itemid=62 |work=Champweb.net |accessdate=February 9, 2007}}</ref> Unlike the Boxster, the Cayman has a large hatchback for access to luggage areas on top and in back of the engine cover. The [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] design is fundamentally the same as that of the Boxster, but features revised settings appropriate to the increase in [[chassis]] stiffness resulting from the Cayman's fixed roof.

The 3.4 [[litre]] [[flat-6]] [[boxer engine]] (M97.21) in the Cayman S is derived from the 3.2 litre powerplant (M96.26) that was used in the Boxster S, but features cylinder heads from the [[Porsche 997|Porsche 997 S]]'s 3.8 litre motor (M97.01) which have the [[VarioCam Plus]] inlet [[valve timing]] and lift system. A less powerful but more fuel efficient version, the 2.7 litre M97.20, powers the base model. The use of these new powerplants exclusively in Caymans ended in [[model year|MY]] 2007 when Porsche upgraded the Boxster (987.310) and Boxster S (987.320).<ref>{{cite web|title=First Drive: 2007 Porsche Boxster S |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=116535?imw=Y |work=Inside Line|accessdate=February 9, 2007}}</ref> 

A 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] [[transaxle]] is standard on the normal Cayman (G87.01), while a 6-speed manual ([[Getrag]] 466) is the default for the S (G87.21) and an option on the normal (A87.20). An electronically controlled 5-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] transaxle ([[Tiptronic]]) is also available on the S (A87.21) and the non-S version (A87.02) (The 2009 models replace this option with a seven-speed "[[PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe)|PDK]]", Porsche's [[dual clutch transmission|dual-clutch robotic manual]] transmission). Other options include active [[shock absorbers]] ([[ThyssenKrupp]] Bilstein GmbH's ''DampTronic'', rebadged as ''PASM'' by Porsche), ceramic [[disc brake]]s (''PCCB''), [[Bi-xenon HID headlamp#HID light sources .28Xenon and Bi-Xenon.29|xenon headlights]] ([[Hella]]'s ''Bi-Xenon'') and an electronically controlled sport mode (''Sport Chrono Package'').

==Cayman S Porsche Design Edition 1==
[[Image:Cayman.jpg|thumb|left|Porsche Cayman S Design Edition 1, spotted in [[Galveston, TX]].]]
The Porsche Design Edition 1 is a Cayman S model designed by [[Porsche Design]], commemorating the 35th anniversary of Porsche Design. The all black car features a black full leather interior including seats, dashboard, and door trim as well as black Alcantara steering wheel, gear change lever, handbrake grip, and headliner.  The DE1 also is fitted standard with the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), 19-inch 911 (997) Turbo wheels with 235/35 ZR 19 front and 265/35 ZR 19 rear tires, unique Porsche Design script on the instrument dials, stainless steel entry plate engraved with "Porsche Design Edition 1", all-red rear taillights, custom vinyl exterior black-on-black graphics, and a numbered plaque on the glovebox cover. As with all PASM-euipped cars, the body is lowered by 10&nbsp;mm. Standard equipment includes an elegant briefcase containing the Flat Six Chronograph, a pocket knife, a pair of sunglasses, a pen, and a key ring – all in black, even the knife blade.

777 vehicles were produced as 2008 models. It went on sale on November 2007 in Germany, followed by the US in January 2008. Base price is 58,600 Euros.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/14/blackout-porsche-unveils-limited-edition-cayman-s-porsche-desig/ Blackout: Porsche unveils limited-edition Cayman S Porsche Design Edition 1]</ref> and USD 69,900 in the U.S.

==Cayman S Sport==
Porsche also announced the production of a limited edition Cayman S Sport, to be available on October 2008 as a 2009 model.<ref>[http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/porsche_file/2009_porsche_boxster_s_porsche_design_edition_2_and_cayman_s_sport_car_news 2009 Porsche Boxster S Porsche Design Edition 2 and Cayman S Sport - Car News]</ref> It features a freer-flowing exhaust, which raises power from 295 PS at 6250 rpm to 303 PS at an identical 6250 rpm. The Cayman S Sport comes in Bright Orange and Signal Green (from the  [[Porsche 911 GT3 RS]]), as well as Carrara White, Speed Yellow, Guards Red, Black and Arctic Silver. The Cayman S has striping on the sides, black 19-inch wheels, as well as an Alcantara steering wheel directly from the 911 GT3 RS. The instrumentation loses its hood. The body is lowered by 1&nbsp;cm, and the performance exhaust system is louder. 700 are to be made for worldwide market.

==Performance==
The performance of the Cayman S approaches that of Porsche's [[Flagship#Automotive|flagship]] sports car, the [[Porsche 997|911 Carrera]].  [[rally racing|Rally]] legend [[Walter Röhrl]] lapped the [[Nordschleife fastest lap times|Nürburgring Nordschleife]] track in a Cayman S equipped with optional 19" wheels, PCCB, and PASM<ref>{{cite web|title=Porsche's new kid on the grid |url=http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=10408 |work=drive.com.au |accessdate=February 12, 2007 }}</ref> in a time of 8 minutes, 11 seconds.<ref>8:11 --- 151.274 km/h - Porsche Cayman S driven by Walter Röhrl as reported by French magazine "sport AUTO" 07/2005</ref><ref>"AutoWeek" Magazine article.

<ref>"Automobile" Magazine 2006 Porsche Cayman S review article. 3rd paragraph. [http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/coupes/0508_porsche_cayman_s Accessed Dec 3rd 2006]</ref> The similarity in performance between the two cars has led to speculation about whether the Cayman S will cannibalize sales of the Carrera, as the basic Carrera's recommended retail price in the [[United States]] is $12,400 higher than that of the Cayman S.

[[Image:Porsche Cayman (Black) - Side.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Side view of the Porsche Cayman S]]

A Cayman prepared and run by privateers Jürgen and Uwe Alzen finished fourth overall (of 220 entrants) in the 2007 Nürburgring 24 Hour race, ahead of two flagship Porsche 997 GT3 RSR's, a 997 GT3 Cup, and a 996 GT3 Cup.<ref>[http://adac.24h-rennen.de/datenbank/ergebnisdatenbank.html Zurich 24h race results, race #35 (in German).] retrieved 2007-[[June 14|Jun-14]]</ref>  Another two privateer Caymans, entered by CSR and MSpeed, finished 22nd and 117th overall, respectively.  Porsche disclaims support for the Cayman teams, while supporting some or all of the 997 teams.<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/sport/touren/artikel.php?artikel_id=13895 Auto Bild article (in German) for July 2007 issue.] retrieved 2007-Jun-14</ref>

A sports car feature which is not offered by Porsche for the Cayman is [[limited slip differential]] (LSD). Some commentators have speculated that LSD is not offered, even as an option, because the Cayman S's performance would then be too close to that of the 911 Carrera (see [[Crippleware]]). Several tuning companies offer Cayman buyers the ability to retrofit an LSD. Also the biggest engine (3.8l) or the turbo engine is not available in the Cayman.

In the 2009 model, an LSD is available as an option if [[PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe)#Porsche|PDK]] is installed.<ref>{{cite web|title=2009 Porsche Cayman Comes To LA, Brings Optional Limited Slip Differential|url=http://jalopnik.com/5093819/2009-porsche-cayman-comes-to-la-brings-optional-limited-slip-differential|work=jalopnik.com |accessdate=December 18, 2008 }}</ref> The base Cayman has received an engine upgrade to 2.9L ({{convert|265|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}), and the Cayman S a 3.4L ({{convert|320|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}). This is significantly more than the previous models offerings, as even the factory tuned 2008 Cayman S Sport with its special exhaust system only produces {{convert|303|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} from its 3.4L powerplant.<ref>{{cite web|title=2008 Porsche Cayman S Sport|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3806/Porsche-Cayman-S-Sport.html|work=Company press release |accessdate=December 18, 2008 }}</ref>

==Name==
Cayman is an alternate spelling of [[caiman]], a [[reptile]] in the same family as the [[alligator]].  The car is not named after the [[Cayman Islands]]; rather the islands also derive their name from the caiman.  On the same day that the first Caymans arrived at dealerships for sale, Porsche adopted four caimans at the [[Stuttgart]]'s [[Wilhelma]] Zoo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porsche Cayman in showrooms|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/porsche-cayman-in-showrooms.html|work=Left Lane News|accessdate=12 January 2008}}</ref>

==Second generation==
The first evolution of the Porsche Cayman (known as "Generation 2") was introduced on 21 February 2009. The standard Cayman engine's displacement was increased from 2.7L to 2.9L, giving a {{convert|20|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} increase to {{convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the Cayman S gains direct injection and a {{convert|25|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} increase to {{convert|320|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Both the Cayman and Cayman S maintain a {{convert|10|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} power advantage over their roadster sibling, the [[Porsche Boxster]]. On the front end, each have their own design for the front bumper. The front signal lamps are designed differently: while both use LED signal lamps, the Cayman’s LED are arranged like the face of dice while the Boxster gets a horizontal row of 4 LEDs. The Porsche Tiptronic S automatic gearbox was replaced by the 7-speed PDK [[dual clutch transmission]] for the new model.  The PDK outperforms the manual transmission with a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 5.4 seconds versus 5.5 seconds for the manual.  The PDK with the sport button option lowers the 0-60&nbsp;mph time to 5.2 seconds<ref>{{cite web|title=Porsche Boxster and Cayman get facelifted|url=http://paultan.org/archives/2008/12/08/porsche-boxster-and-cayman-gets-facelifted/|work=PaulTan.Org|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref>
