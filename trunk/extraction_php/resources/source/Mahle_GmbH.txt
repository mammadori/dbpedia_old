'''Mahle GmbH''' is one of the 50 largest automotive suppliers worldwide<ref>Automotive News 150 Suppliers 2007. May 12, 2008</ref>. As the leading manufacturer of components and systems for combustion engines and its periphery, the Mahle Group is among the top three systems suppliers worldwide for piston systems, cylinder components, valve train systems, air management systems, and liquid management systems.

==Worldwide presence==
More than 48,000 employees work in 110 production plants and seven research and development centers. Worldwide 2,300 development engineers and technicians work as partners for Mahle's customers on products and systems focused on the continuous development of the combustion engine.

In 2008, the Mahle Group generated sales in excess of 5 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] [[Euro]]. The company has it's headquarters in [[Stuttgart]].

== History ==
In 1920 the engineer and pilot [[Hellmuth Hirth]] established together with others a small workshop in Cannstatt, where he developed and constructed a two-stroke engine.

===Formation===
26-year-old Hermann Mahle started working for Hellmuth Hirth on December 1, 1920, as the company’s seventh employee. The workshop was then called "''Versuchsbau Hellmuth Hirth''". December 1, 1920 is acknowledged as the birthday of today’s Mahle Group. It soon became clear that the workshop would not survive by only conducting engine tests. So the need arose to build a profitable line of production in order to finance ongoing engine tests. At that time, in the automobile production, pistons were generally made of cast iron. ''Versuchsbau Hellmuth Hirth'' decided to attempt to build light-alloy pistons for combustion engines.
 
On November 1, 1922 Hermann Mahle’s brother, Ernst Mahle, joined the factory as Head of Engineering. In 1924 the company was re-named ''Elektrometall [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]]''. 

In 1927, the Company developed the first controlled-expansion piston in Germany and in 1931, the world’s first aluminum ring carrier piston for diesel engines. Following this, piston technology was steadily improved. 

In 1938 the conversion into Mahle [[Kommanditgesellschaft|KG]] took place and the new company logo was introduced. The company expanded. New products were developed and produced (e.g. aluminum cylinders with [[Chrome plating|Cromal (Chrome plating)]] surface coatings in 1951).

In 1964, the Company founders Hermann and Ernst Mahle decided to waive private ownership in their companies and make the companies part of a foundation for public benefits. They renounced the largest part of their personal property and transferred the company shares to the Mahle [[Private foundation|Foundation]].
 
===Aluminium engines===
In 1976 Mahle placed the first European Aluminum engine blocks made in low-pressure die casting ready for series production. In 1988 the composite camshaft is enhanced to production standard, and in 2001 Mahle presented a revolutionary cooling concept for pistons in high-speed passenger car diesel engines. The first all-plastic oil filter in the world followed in 2003. Mahle developed and constructed its first complete engine in the same year, which was applied in the Formula Student.

Today, Mahle is a predominant system supplier for components of piston systems, cylinder components, valve train systems, air management systems, and liquid management systems, for all well-known automobile manufacturers.
