== Overview ==
Continental is structured in six divisions: 
* ''Chassis & Safety'' 
* ''Powertrain'' 
* ''Interior''
* ''Passenger & Light Truck Tires''
* ''Commercial Vehicle Tires''
* ''ContiTech''

One of Continental's main areas of expertise and technological leadership is '''Fuel Consumption Reduction''', achieved through more efficient fuel injection systems, reduced rolling resistance tyres and hybrid propulsion systems.

Continental sells tires worldwide under the ''Continental'' brand. It also produces and commercializes other brands on a regional level, such as ''General'', ''Euzkadi'', or ''Barum''.  Continental's customers include all major automobile, truck and bus producers, such as [[Volkswagen]], [[Daimler AG]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Volvo]], [[Iveco]], [[Schmitz]], [[Koegel]], [[Freightliner Trucks]], [[BMW]], [[General Motors]], [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]], [[Honda]], [[Renault]] and [[Porsche]]{{Fact|date=May 2007}}.

In 2001, Continental acquired a controlling interest in Temic, DaimlerChrysler's automotive-electronics business, which is now part of Continental Automotive Systems.  The company also purchased German automotive rubber and plastics company [[Phoenix AG]] in 2004, and the automotive electronics unit of [[Motorola]] in 2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conti-online.com/generator/www/com/en/continental/portal/themes/continental/history/1997_2006_en.html |title=Continental Corporation - History 1995 - 2007}}</ref>. Continental recently acquired [[Siemens VDO]] from [[Siemens|Siemens AG]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conti-online.com/generator/www/de/en/cas/cas/themes/press_service/hidden/press_releases/company/economy_slash_business/acquisitions/pr_2007_07_25_siemens_vdo/pr_2007_07_25_siemens_vdo_en.html |title=Continental AG and Siemens VDO Automotive AG join together to form automotive supplier at forefront of global market |accessdate=2007-08-01 }}</ref>

It recently started the construction of a plant in Costa Rica.

== Takeover offer ==
In August 2008 Continental agreed to be taken over by the [[Family business|family-owned]] [[List of auto parts|auto parts]] manufacturer [[Schaeffler Group]] and a consortium of banks in a deal valuing the company at €12 billion. Schaeffler has however pledged to restrict its stake in the company to less than 50% for at least four years.<ref name="tele">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/08/22/cnball122.xml|title=Schaeffler family buys out tyre giant Continental for €12bn|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=[[21 August]] [[2008]]|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref> Continental [[chief executive officer]] Manfred Wennemer, who had tried to preserve the independence of the company, in contrast to the chairman of the supervisory board, Hubertus von Grünberg, subsequently announced his resignation, stating that the "sneaky" move had been carried out "egotistically, high-handedly and irresponsibly".<ref name="tele" />  Dr. Karl-Thomas Neumann has succeeded Manfred Wennemer as [[chief executive officer]] of Continental on September 1, 2008.

== Continental Tire in North America ==
Continental Tire entered the North American Tire industry with its 1987 purchase of General Tire, forming Continental Tire of North America (CTNA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conti-online.com/generator/www/com/en/continental/portal/themes/continental/history/1971_1995_en.html |title=Continental Corporation - History 1971 - 1995}}</ref>.  At the time, Continental was following other tire manufacturers, such as [[Bridgestone]] and [[Michelin]], into the American tire market.

The North American headquarters of the tire divisions are relocating to Lancaster County, South Carolina by 2009.  The North American headquarters of the CAS division are located in Auburn Hills, directly South of the Great Lakes Crossing Mega Mall.

In 2006, CTNA closed its tire production plant in [[Mayfield, Kentucky]]<ref>[http://charlotte.bizjournals.com/charlotte/stories/2006/07/31/daily31.html Continental Tire to close Kentucky plant - Charlotte Business Journal:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and announced the cessation of tire production in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]<ref>[http://charlotte.bizjournals.com/charlotte/stories/2006/03/06/daily39.html Continental may halt production, lay off 478 - Charlotte Business Journal:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.  The same year, the Company announced that effective January 1, 2006 it would be implementing massive cuts on retiree health care for retirees across the country<ref>[http://www.usw.org/usw/program/content/3940.php USW: Continental Retirees<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

In response to the massive health care cuts, the United Steelworkers and several employees filed a [http://www.usw.org/usw/program/adminlinks/docs//retiree_lawsuit_pringle.complaint.pdf class action lawsuit] against the company. The company and the Steelworkers have reached a settlement in this case which has yet to be approved by the courts.
