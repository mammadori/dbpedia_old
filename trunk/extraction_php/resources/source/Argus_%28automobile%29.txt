The '''Argus''' was a German [[automobile]] manufactured by Internationale Automobilzentrale KG Jeannin & Co from 1902 to 1904, then Argus Motoren-Gesellschaft Jeannin & Co from 1904 to 1906, and then Argus Motoren-Gesellschaft m.b.H. from November 1906 to 1945. 

The company was founded by [[Henri Jeannin]] in Berlin, and originally built copies of [[Panhard| Panhard & Levassor]] cars; they also featured P&L engines, and most of the other components of the vehicles came from [[France]]. In 1903 the company began producing engines of its own design; Argus cars now had 2,380 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] [[two-cylinder]] engines, and 4,960&nbsp;cc and 9,240&nbsp;cc [[four-cylinder]] engines. The cars were luxurious, and quite expensive as well.

The company went on to produce marine and aero engines. In 1929 they briefly returned to car engines making some for [[Horch]].
