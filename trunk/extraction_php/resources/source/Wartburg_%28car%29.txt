'''Wartburg''' is a [[automobile|car]] [[marque]] manufactured in [[East Germany]].

The name "Wartburg" derives from [[Wartburg Castle]] on one of the hills overlooking the town of [[Eisenach]] where the cars were manufactured.

From the 1950s, Wartburgs had a three-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke engine]] with only seven moving parts (three [[piston]]s, three [[connecting rod]]s and one [[crankshaft]]).<ref>[http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Wartburg_(car) Wartburg (car) on reference.com]</ref>{{Citation broken|date=October 2009}}

==History==
===First usage of name===
[[File:Wartburg 1898.jpg|thumb|1898 Wartburg]]
The marque dates back to 1898 when a car made by [[Automobilwerk Eisenach]] was named the Wartburgwagen. It consisted of a two-seating cane chair, four mudgards, two headlamps, and a two-cylinder, 765-cc engine. Its top speed was 25&nbsp;mph. It was ''quite'' the flimsy contraption{{Whom?|date=October 2009}}, but nevertheless it sold perfectly fine in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The name was dropped in 1904 when the company changed hands but re-appeared briefly in the early 1930s on the [[BMW 3/15#3/15 DA-3 Wartburg|BMW 3/15 DA-3 Wartburg]], which was BMW's first [[sports car]].<ref name=bmwccn.no_315_1>BMW 3/15 PS, 315/1 and 319/1 - early roadsters</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2009}}<ref name=Motorsport3_15>BMW Motorsport - BMW 3/15</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2009}}

===Main usage of name===
The name was revived in 1956 by [[VEB Automobilwerk Eisenach]] and given to an updated version of their [[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau|IFA]] F9 car which had been in production since 1950. The new car had a more powerful version of the three-cylinder two-stroke engine driving the front wheels and a completely new body.

Exports to [[West Germany]] started in 1958, and by the early 1960s the car was exported to many other countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]]. The 311 model was manufactured in a number of variations, including [[pickup truck|pickup]], [[station wagon|estate]], and two-seater [[roadster]].

The engine was enlarged to 992&nbsp;cc in 1962 and a completely new body was manufactured after 1966. Also in 1966 the gearbox gained [[synchromesh]] on all speeds and was designed to [[freewheel]] as an engine protection measure, which had the unfortunate side-effect that the car did not benefit from [[engine braking]]. Due to the fact that the engine was a two stroke unit, it relied on the passage of the petrol mixture (A mixture of special two stroke oil and petrol, at a ratio of 1:40) to lubricate the engine. Without the freewheel device, on long down-hill runs the engine could be starved of lubricant and seize. 

The new car, the [[Wartburg 353|353]], was known in some export markets as the '''Wartburg Knight'''.  The two-stroke engine was replaced by a 1300&nbsp;cc [[four-stroke cycle|four stroke]] [[Volkswagen]] engine in 1988, but otherwise time and technology passed it by. The final nail in its coffin was the introduction of the [[German mark|Deutschmark]] (DM), as the cost of producing a car reached 20,000 DM. Production ended in 1991, as [[German reunification]] spelt its end. The factory was acquired by [[Opel]] in 1991.

There are still many cars in drivable condition and Wartburg owners' clubs exist throughout Europe. Many Wartburgs are still used as rally racing cars.<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/patrickdown/2564967203/ Flickr: Wartburg Rally Car]</ref>

==Derivatives==
The [[sports car]] [[Melkus RS 1000]] used a mid-mounted three-cylinder two-stroke engine from the [[Wartburg 353]].
