The '''Volkswagen Transporter T5''' range is the fifth generation of [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] (VWCV/VWN) medium sized [[light commercial vehicle]] and people mover Caravelle/Multivan range.  It was launched 6 January 2003, and went into full production in April 2003, replacing the fourth generation [[Volkswagen Transporter (T4)|T4 Transporter]] range.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.volkswagen-commercial-vehicles.com/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/en_vwn/unternehmen/chronikuebersicht/2001-heute.html Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles - Company - Chronicle - 2001-today > Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles - Company - Chronicle > Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles - Company > Volkswage...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Key markets for the T5 range are Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and Turkey.  The [[U.S.]] market does not receive the T5 range due to it being classed as a light truck, which thereby automatically includes a 25% extra tax (known as the [[chicken tax]]) on importation into the US.

In June 2009, VWCV announced the one-millionth T5 rolled off the production line in [[Hannover]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles builds one millionth T5|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/vwag/vwcorp/info_center/en/news/2009/06/vw_commercial_vehicles_builds_one_millionth_t5.html|work=[[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft]]|publisher=VolkswagenAG.com|date=30 June 2009|accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref>

The full cargo payload potential of the Transporter is between {{convert|800|kg|0|lk=on}} to 1.4&nbsp;[[tonne]]s.  Load compartment volumes range from 5.8&nbsp;[[cubic metre|m³]] to 9.3&nbsp;m³.

In Mexico, the T5 Transporter range is marketed under the North American '''Eurovan''' nameplate.

==People movers — Kombi to Multivan==

The T5 is also available in 6 to 9 [[car seat|seat]] configurations called Shuttle, Kombi, Caravelle, and Multivan.

*'''Kombi''': This is the entry level people mover in the Transporter 1 range.  It is available with every [[internal combustion engine]] in the T5 range, and in all roof heights and wheelbases.  The Kombi can seat 4 to 9 people.  It is equipped with basic features such as rubber flooring, heater for driver's compartment, and side panel trim and headlining in the driver's compartment.  Optional features include central locking, air conditioning for front and rear compartments, electrically controlled and heated mirrors, sliding windows, [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP), side and curtain [[airbag]]s, cruise control, electric windows, [[sunroof]], and an electric sliding door.

*'''Shuttle''': This is the next level up,in 13458,it is only available in SWB and LWB, with the full engine range, but is limited to the standard roof height.  The Shuttle seats 7 to 9 persons.  Standard features are moulded trim, a second heater, sun blinds for the passenger compartment, and a sliding window on the left hand side only.  Optional extras over the Kombi include carpeting and an 'Appearance Package', which includes colour coded bumpers, double folding rear three-seater bench seat, and a luggage compartment light.

*'''Caravelle''': This includes most of the Kombi and Shuttle features already standard, plus ESP, [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS), Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR - more commonly known as [[traction control system]]), passengers seat with adjustable lumber support, air conditioning, electrically adjustable and heated mirrors, and armrests for front seat passenger and driver.  Optional features include Automatic Tailgate Power Closing system, and multi-disc CD changer.  The Caravelle is only available in SWB or LWB, with a maximum of seven seats.

*'''Multivan''': This is the range-topping people mover based on the T5 platform.  Available with 6 or 7 seats, it has a unique rail feature in which seats can slide forward and backward into any configuration.  A wide range of accessories are available, like tables and refrigerators which fit into the rails to be secured or movable if necessary.  The Multivan has all safety features as standard such as ABS, ESP, ASR, and front, side, and curtain airbags.  The Multivan is sold under the Caravelle nameplate in the UK.

==Sportline==
The Transporter Sportline is the range-topping trim level of the Transporter panel and Kombi van.  It comes as standard with a {{convert|174|PS|kW bhp|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) diesel engine, generating [[torque]] of {{convert|400|Nm|0|lk=on}} at 2,000&nbsp;rpm, and is mated to a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual gearbox]].

Other standard features on the Sportline include 18" weight-rated [[alloy wheel]]s, body-coloured bumpers, door mirrors and handles.  It features suspension which is lowered by {{convert|30|mm|1|lk=on}} over standard variants, and has chrome side bars and grille, a roof spoiler, as well as a special Volkswagen badge.

The Sportline featured in an episode of [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] TV series; where Clarkson, Hammond and May had to choose three vans to compete in a series of challenges, including transporting equipment for [[The Who]]. [[Jeremy Clarkson]] claimed the Sportline to be "the fastest van in Britain".

This claim was put to the test by competitor TV programme [[Fifth Gear]] where the Sportline has been put head to head with [[The A-Team]] van, as well as the [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]] Sport-X.  The Sportline comfortably won a race against the A-Team [[Chevrolet Express|GMC van]], even with [[Tiff Needell]] cutting corners and using short cuts in the vein of the television series.  Against the Sport-X, even though the Mercedes had a more powerful engine, it was found that the traction control was too sensitive to be able to make quick progress around a track.

==California==
{{main|Volkswagen California}}
The '''[[Volkswagen California|California (Kombi) Beach]]''' and '''[[Volkswagen California|California]]''' are [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] T5-based in-house designed and built [[motorhome]] range.

In September 2009, [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] launched a revamped and [[facelift (automobile)|facelifted]] T5 range, which is sold under four main labels the Transporter, Caravelle, Multivan and California.

The revised range showcases new technology to the medium van segment, which includes Hill Start Assist, and a world-first with the [[dual clutch transmission]]<ref name=DCTfacts>{{cite web|title=Volkswagen (Commercial Vehicles) medium van is first with DCT|url=http://www.dctfacts.com/dcmarket_pg4.asp|work=The Lubrizol Corporation|publisher=DCTfacts.com|date=24 September 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009}}</ref> named [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG) - which is also available with [[4motion]] [[four-wheel drive]], Side Lane Assist<ref name=DCTfacts/> for monitoring blind spots when changing lanes, Tyre Monitor Display for monitoring tyre pressures,<ref name=DCTfacts/> [[Dynaudio]] sound system and RNS series touchscreen and navigation systems and a reversing camera.<ref name=DCTfacts/>
