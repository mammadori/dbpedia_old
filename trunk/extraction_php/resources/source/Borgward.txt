'''Borgward''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[automobile]] manufacturer founded by [[Carl F. W. Borgward]] ([[November 10]], [[1890]] - [[July 28]], [[1963]]).   The company was based in [[Bremen]].  The Borgward group eventually produced cars with the four brands Borgward, [[Hansa (car)|Hansa]], [[Goliath (car)|Goliath]] and [[Lloyd (car)|Lloyd]].

==Blitzkarren==
The first "[[automobile]]" Carl Borgward designed was the ''Blitzkarren'' (i.e. ''lightning cart''), a sort of tiny three-wheeled van with only two horsepower (1.5 kW), which was, in the gap in the market it filled, an enormous success. Traders with a small budget bought it for delivery. The [[Reichspost]] ordered many of them for postal service.

==Hansa Lloyd==
In 1929 Borgward became the director of [[Hansa (car)|Hansa Lloyd AG]] and led the development of the [[Hansa Konsul]]. In February 1937 came the new [[Hansa Borgward 2000]] and in 1939 the name was shortened to [[Borgward 2000]]. The 2000 model was followed by the [[Borgward 2300]] that remained in production until 1942. After [[World War II]] the company presented the [[Borgward Hansa 1500]]. One of the top engineers at Borgward between 1938 and 1952 was Dipl. Ing. [[Hubert M. Meingast]].

==Isabella and P100==
Production of the [[Borgward Isabella]] began in 1954. The Isabella would become Borgward's most popular model and remained in production for the life of the company. In 1959 the [[Borgward P100]] was introduced, with its impressive pneumatic suspension.

==Sports racers==
Borgward introduced a line of 1500 cc [[Sports Car Racing|sports racers]] in the late 1950s, with the 16-valve engine from these becoming a successful [[Formula Two]] power unit (which was also used by some F1 privateers in 1961).

==Financial problems==
Financial problems appeared because Carl Borgward allowed the different makes to act independently, practicing no joint development or sharing of parts. While Borgward pioneered technical novelties in the German market such as air suspension and automatic transmission, the four makes competed against companies like Opel and VW that increased production yearly and lowered prices. Borgward suffered quality problems as well. The Lloyd Arabella was technically advanced as a water-cooled boxer with front wheel drive, but plagued with problems such as water leakage and gearbox glitches. Although Lloyd lost money on the car it was more expensive than the direct competitors.

==Liquidation==
In 1961 the company was forced into liquidation by creditors though Carl Borgward insisted the company was solvent.  Events proved him right and all the creditors were fully paid off.  In 1963 all manufacturing equipment for the Borgward Isabella and P100 was sold to [[Mexico]]. In July 1963 Carl Borgward died, two years after his company went bankrupt.

The German magazine [[Der Spiegel]] reports in 1965 that, with a little help, the Borgward company could have easily overcome its problems in 1961. Apparently the company didn't have to go bankrupt at all.<ref>[http://www.borgward.nl/docs-uk/history.htm History of Borgward]</ref>

==Production in Mexico==
The start of production in Mexico was delayed, but was eventually begun in 1967 by the entrepreneur [[Gregorio Ramirez Gonzalez]].  Production in Mexico ceased in 1970 <ref>http://www.borgwardisabella.com/Seiten/BorgwardClub/History.html</ref>.
