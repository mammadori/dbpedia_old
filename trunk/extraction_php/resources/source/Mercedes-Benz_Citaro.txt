The '''Mercedes-Benz Citaro''' (or '''O530''') is the current [[Mercedes-Benz]]/[[EvoBus]] mainstream [[bus]] intended for [[public transport]], introduced in [[1997]] and replaced the [[Mercedes-Benz O405|Mercedes-Benz O405/O405N series]]. Manufactured in [[Mannheim]] ([[Germany]]), [[Ligny-en-Barrois]] ([[France]]) and [[Sámano]] ([[Spain]]), it features a [[low floor]] for easy access.

==Models==
===Urban model===
The standard '''urban model''' is available in a number of versions:
* standard 12m twin-axle
* 10.5m twin-axle (Citaro K)
* 15m tri-axle (Citaro L)
* 18m [[articulated bus|articulated]] (Citaro G)
* 20m four-axle articulated (Citaro GL "CapaCity")
* 12m twin-axle "low entry" (Citaro LE)
[[Image:Bucharest Citaro bus 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Transport in Bucharest#Surface transport|Citaro in Bucharest ]]]]

===Suburban/interurban model===
A series of '''suburban/interurban versions''' is also produced, with all seats fitted on platforms:
* 12m twin-axle (Citaro Ü)
* 13m twin-axle (Citaro MÜ)
* 15m tri-axle (Citaro LÜ)
* 18m [[articulated bus|articulated]] (Citaro GÜ)
* 12m twin-axle "low entry" (Citaro LE Ü)
* 13m twin-axle "low entry" (Citaro LE MÜ)

===Specifications===
[[Image:Citaro Mannheim 100 7665.jpg|thumb|Interior (standard urban model)]] 
Operators are able to choose between two different front stylings: the standard design features an angled destination display and is primarily marketed for urban buses, while a version with a one-piece windscreen covering the destination display also is available and is primarily intended for interurban use. However, all models are available with either version.

Other customizations include the number and type of doors as well as the internal layout. Two types of seats are offered as part of the standard range, again with a basic model for urban use and an enhanced version for longer-distance routes, although both also are available on all models.

Aside from the usual [[diesel engine]]s, the Citaro is also available with a powerful [[Euro IV]] [[compressed natural gas|natural gas]] engine (model M 447 hLAG) rated at 185 kW (252 PS) or 240 kW (326 PS) - the latter rating used mainly for interurban and articulated buses or standard-length city buses operating in areas with a hilly topography. These engines are also optionally available with [[Enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle|Enhanced Environmentally-friendly Vehicle]] (EEV) certification, meaning that their emission levels are lower than even the most stringent [[European Union]] emissions standards.

In [[2005]], Mercedes-Benz/EvoBus launched a new version of the Citaro to coincide with the introduction of [[Euro IV]]-, [[Euro V]]- and [[Enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle|EEV]]-compliant engines. Apart from minor technical alternations, mainly to accommodate the new generation of engines, the external design received a facelift to give the buses a less angular look, with internal panelling altered accordingly. Production of the old model ceased by autumn [[2006]]. The Citaro LE and Citaro LE Ü models, which were introduced at the same time, were never produced to the old design.

===Non-standard bodies===
As a one-off, German operators [[üstra]] of [[Hanover]] and [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe|LVB]] of [[Leipzig]] took delivery of a batch of Citaros bodied to a special design by [[James Irvine (designer)|James Irvine]] for the [[Expo 2000|2000 World Exposition]]. Leipzig's vehicles were lent to Hanover for the duration of the exhibition, but subsequently returned to normal service in their home city. All other Citaros bodied by Mercedes-Benz were to standard designs, however a number of chassis were bodied by independent manufacturers, most notably [[Carrosserie Hess|Hess]] of [[Switzerland]]. However, the Citaro has more recently only been sold as a complete product.

In 2007 the workshops of the [[Szeged]] ([[Hungary]]) bus operator SZKT converted a regular Citaro to a trolleybus. As of January 2008 3 such buses are already serving as a trolley and more examples are in preparation in the near future.<ref>YouTube: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB-7K4N7PtI Mercedes-Benz Citaro trolley in Szeged]. Retrieved on 31 October 2007.</ref>

In 2009, the Centre of Ambulance Services in [[Dubai]] took delivery of three Citaros, which had been modified to become the world's largest [[ambulance]]s.

===Hydrogen fuel cell version===
Even though the usual Citaro models are powered by [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[natural gas]], there is also a [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]-powered version, designated ''Citaro BZ'' or ''O530BZ''. About 35 of these buses have been in service in a variety of different world cities in order to [[Fuel cell bus trial|test the feasibility of hydrogen fuel cells]] in different operating circumstances and different conditions, especially weather conditions.

===Hybrid electric version===
The Mercedes-Benz Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid is a [[series-hybrid]] [[articulated bus]] with a compact 450 kg, 4-cylinder, 4.8 litre, 160 kW, Euro 4 diesel engine providing power for a roof-mounted 19.4 kWh [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, and four 80 kW electric wheel [[hub motor]]s located on the centre and rear axles. (Contrast a conventional bus diesel engine: 6-cylinder, 12 litre, 1,000 kg.) The battery pack is also charged by [[regenerative braking]] (recuperation). The manufacturer anticipates fuel consumption 20% to 30% lower than conventional diesel Citaros. Field trials with a public transport operator are planned for 2009.

==London fires==
{{Main|Articulated buses in London}}
When [[Transport for London]] bought articulated Citaros in [[2003]] and [[2004]], four buses caught fire, although there were no casualties involved. In fact, one was burnt on its delivery journey, for unexplained reasons. Mercedes-Benz did, however, address the problem, though the buses were withdrawn for some time that saw the brief return of the just-retired [[Routemaster]]s. Unfortunately, these buses were said to have marred the reputation of articulated buses in the [[United Kingdom]], and some Londoners nicknamed them "Chariots of Fire".<ref>The London Bus Page: [http://www.londonbuspage.com/040324.htm Chariots Of Fire Taken Off The Road]. 25 March 2004; retrieved on 31 October 2007.</ref>

== Latin American Citaros ==
In [[Latin America]], Citaros are not present in large quantities in public transport systems. Only Mexico has 14 Spanish-built Citaros for the BRT Internal System of [[UNAM]].

It is rumored that several public transport enterprises have plans to acquire Citaros in Mexico.
