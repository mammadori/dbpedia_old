'''BMW M GmbH''' (previously: '''BMW Motorsport GmbH''') is a subsidiary of German car manufacturer [[BMW]] AG. 

BMW M, also known as M-Technik or just "M" (for ''Motorsport'') was initially created to facilitate BMW’s racing program, which was very successful in the 1960s and 1970s. As time progressed, BMW M began to supplement BMW's vehicles portfolio with specially modified higher trim models, for which they are now most known for to the general public. These M-badged cars traditionally include modified engines, suspensions, interior trims, aerodynamics, and exterior modifications to set them apart from their counterparts. 

==History==
[[image:BMW-M.M3.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[BMW]] [[BMW E36|E36]] [[BMW M3|M3]] in [[United Kingdom]]]]
Established in May 1972 with just eight employees, it grew to 400 employees by 1988, and is currently an integral part of BMW's market presence. The first racing project was BMW’s [[BMW E9|3.0 CSL]].

After the success of BMW M in racing venues and the growing market for high performance sports cars, M introduced cars for sale to the public. The first official M-badged car for sale to the public was the [[BMW M1|M1]], revealed at the Paris Motor Show in 1978.  The M1, however, was more of a racecar in domestic trim than an everyday driver.  The direction of the M cars changed with the 1979 release of the [[BMW 5 Series|M535i]], which was a high performance version of BMW’s popular 5 Series mid-size sedan. 

Also, BMW M supplied the 6.1 liter V-12 engine that powers the [[McLaren F1]], which, like its engine supplier and manufacturer, has enjoyed plenty of racing success, famously winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in 1995, the first year of competition for the [[McLaren F1 GTR|GTR]] racing variant.

==Modified Production versions==
Since 1978, BMW M has offered modified versions of nearly every vehicle on BMW’s production line. Most recently, the BMW [[BMW X5|X5]] and [[BMW X6|X6]] [[BMW Sports Activity Series|sport activity vehicles]] received M derivatives for the 2010 model year, the first M vehicles that had four-wheel drive and also the first that were not passenger cars. 

Currently, the lines without an M version are the [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]], the [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]], the [[BMW X3|X3]], and the [[BMW Z4|Z4]]. The Z4 is the only one of the preceding to previously have an M variant (note, the current 1 series has no relation to the original M1).

===M-Cars vs. M-badged cars===
There are several BMW models which BMW Motorsport made changes on, without them becoming full M-Cars. Vehicles which have been modified by BMW Motorsport, but are not full M-Cars, may feature plain "M" badges with no number, whilst full M-Cars will have "M" badges with the model number (e.g. "[[BMW M3|M3]]" or "[[BMW M5|M5]]"). One exception to this is the [[M Coupe]] model, both Z3 and Z4 variants, which only have on the boot a plain "M" badge with no number displayed. These cars are full M-Cars.


In recent years, M badges have been used to accent non-M factory options. Examples of this include the [[BMW E46|E46]] 3 series, in which the performance package option upgraded the car to include M68 style rims which had small M badges below the BMW Roundels. In other instances, M styling without the badges has trickled down into non-M cars as factory options. For example, both the [[BMW E39|E39]] and [[BMW E60|E60]] 5 series sedans had optional aerodynamic packages that included strongly influenced [[BMW M5|M5]] styling (for example bumpers). It is not unusual to see "standard" BMW's with "M" badges or ribbons accenting the design.

===Exceptions===
*The 2010 [[BMW E70|X5]] and [[BMW E71|X6]]-based M vehicles bore their normal model designations followed by the "M" stripe badge (the X5 M and X6 M). Had the nomenclatures followed tradition, the vehicles would have an MX5 and MX6 model designation, already used by [[Mazda]].<ref><https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/p/pcgl/pressDetail.html?outputChannelId=6&id=T0011958EN&left_menu_item=node__2251 Press Release: The BMW X5 M.

*The Z3/Z4-based M Roadster and M Coupe bore numberless "M" badges as standard fitment.
*The [[BMW M6|M635csi]] followed the M535i naming tradition but was a fully fledged M-Car (the M6).

== Current Official M Cars ==
* [[BMW M3#E90.2F92.2F93 M3|M3]] - E90 Sedan, E92 Coupe, E93 Cabriolet (2008 to present)

* [[BMW X6 M|X6 M]] - E71 [[SAV]] (2010 to present)

==Previous official M cars ==
* [[BMW M1|M1]] - E26 Supercar Coupe, no relation with the modern E81/E82/E87/E88 1 series
* [[BMW M3|M3]] - E30 Coupe, E36 Coupe/Sedan/Cabriolet, E46 Coupe/Cabriolet
* [[BMW M5|M5]] - E28 Sedan, E34 Sedan/Touring, E39 Sedan

* [[BMW M Coupe|M Coupe]] - E36/7 and E86 Coupe
* [[BMW M Roadster|M Roadster]] - E36/8 and E85 Roadster

==M Badged (Unofficial) Cars==
* [[BMW E12#Special Models|E12 M535i]] (1979-1981) - Often (unofficially) considered the first mass "production" vehicle built by BMW Motorsport
* [[BMW 8-Series|E31 850CSi]] (1992-1996) - An M car in all but name; it had a BMW M–sourced engine and its VIN indicated that it was developed by BMW Motorsport, like all other M cars.<ref>[http://www.e31.net/models.html#850CSi 850CSi @ E31.net]</ref>
* [[BMW M8 Prototype|E31 M8 Prototype]] - A rumored vehicle which was for unknown reasons canceled by [[BMW]]

==Competition==
Audi's RS models are often reviewed in direct competition to a similarly-sized BMW M car, such as the [[Audi RS4]] vs [[BMW M3]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.magazine.co.uk/pdf_supplement.php?jchk=1&nolog=1&s_id=1&ss_id=2&jlnk=lsl0510 |title=evo magazine Featured Supplement: BMW M3 vs Audi RS4 |publisher=Evo.magazine.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/BMW-M3-coupe-vs-Audi-RS4-cabrio |title=BMW M3 coupe vs Audi RS4 cabrio CAR review &#124; Road Testing Reviews &#124; Car Magazine Online |publisher=Carmagazine.co.uk |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>.  However, BMW M cars are still the best known in-house [[sport sedan|high performance derivatives]], due to the longevity of their nameplates, and as they occupy the undisputed position at the top of their lineup from BMW. For instance, while the M3 has always been the top-performing version of BMW's compact executive classification, their competition has either underwent designation changes or not been consistently produced (the [[Audi RS4]] has not been offered for every generation or sold in every market, while the [[Audi S4]] has less performance than the M3). 

BMW M also faces competition from several independent companies offering their own performance versions of BMW models; some performance packs can be retrofitted to existing cars while others are applied to new cars bought directly from BMW AG and converted prior to first registration. Such companies include [[Hamann Motorsport]], [[Alpina]], [[Dinan Cars]], [[AC Schnitzer]] and [[Hartge]].
