The '''ARVW''' (Aerodynamic Research Volkswagen) concept car has been built by [[Volkswagen]] in the late 1970s specially as an object of [[aerodynamic]] research of the Volkswagen company to trace correlation between a vehicle body shape and fuel consumption at a high speed. A tuned six-cylinder [[turbodiesel]] engine and standard [[gearbox]] were used while the body was made from [[aluminium]] and [[composite materials]]. In 1980 it was the fastest diesel car in the world, reaching the top speed at 362.07 km/h.
