'''Eisenacher Motorenwerk (EMW)''' was an [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles based in [[Eisenach]]. EMW also entered [[Formula One]] as a [[List of Formula One constructors|constructor]] in 1953, but participated in only one race, the [[1953 German Grand Prix]].

One of the pre-[[World War II]] [[BMW]] factories was located in Eisenach, which after the war was taken over by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], since Eisenach was situated in the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Soviet occupation zone]]. The factory continued producing cars and motorcycles under the BMW brand, but after a lawsuit in 1952 they had to change the name to EMW instead. The logotype was also similar, but instead of the blue BMW used, EMW used red. 

Later the automobile section of EMW became [[VEB Automobilwerk Eisenach]] and built the [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]]. Motorcycle manufacture ended in the 1950s and was replaced by the AWO 425 built by [[Simson]] at [[Suhl]].
