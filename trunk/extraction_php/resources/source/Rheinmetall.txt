'''Rheinmetall [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[automotive]] and [[defense industry|defense]] company with factories in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Kassel]] and [[Unterlüß]].

==History==
It was founded on 13 April 1889 by Heinrich Ehrhardt, with help from a consortium of banks, as Rheinische Metallwaren- und Maschinenfabrik Aktiengesellschaft.

It has a long tradition of making [[gun]]s and [[artillery]] pieces. The company is also involved in a variety of advanced metal-working and milling technologies.  This has allowed it to provide special high-quality components for small arms in addition to its heavy weapon production.

In 1993 Rheinmetall acquired the [[Mauser|Mauser AG]] and in 1996 and 1999 the majority share-holdings of [[STN Atlas]] and [[Oerlikon Contraves]], all of which are major European defense companies. STN Atlas was later split into [[Atlas Elektronik]] and [[Rheinmetall Defence Electronics]], the latter is now a full subsidiary of Rheinmetall.

In March 2008, Rheinmetall acquired Dutch defence company Stork PKV. 

Rheinmetall made bomb fuses during [[World War II]], notably a double-capacitor design which was particularly dangerous to defuse should the bomb not explode on impact. Many bomb disposal personnel were killed.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The patent for the fuse was filed in the UK two years before Hitler came to power and the UK Armed Forces spotted this and the patent then helped enormously with disarming these particular bombs.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The US Patent Office put a 32-year secrecy order on a similar patent by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] in 1948.

The [[MG 42]], the general-purpose medium machine gun of the Wehrmacht, was also built by Rheinmetall. Its  successor, the [[MG3]], is still used by the [[Bundeswehr]].
