The '''Volkswagen Group A platform''' is an [[automobile platform]] shared among [[compact car|compact]] and [[mid-size car]]s of the [[Volkswagen Group]].

It was originally based on the engineering concept of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1]], and is applicable to either [[front-wheel drive|front-]] or [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles, using only [[front-engine design|front-mounted]] [[transverse engine]]s.

Volkswagens based on this platform have been referred to by generation number, ie. the first Golf version would be referred to as an "A1 Golf".  A common substitute for the "A*" is to use the "Mk*" ("Mark") nomenclature to denote generation.  For example, both the MK1 and MK2 Sciroccos are both based on the A1 platform.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

Under Volkswagen's revised platform naming system, the "A4" platform is now known as the '''PQ34''' platform, and what would have been called the '''A5''' platform is officially the '''PQ35''' platform.  The new nomenclature is derived as follows:

*'''P''' indicates a ''passenger'' car platform
*'''Q''' (''quer'') indicates a ''transverse engine''
*'''3''' indicates the platform ''size'' or ''class''
*'''5''' indicates the ''evolution'' or ''generation''

==A1==
'''A1''' platform cars (''Typ'' numbers in brackets):
*[[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|VW Golf Mk1/Rabbit Mk1]] (17)
*[[Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet#Golf Mk1 Cabriolet .281979.E2.88.921993.29|Cabriolet]] (17)
*[[Volkswagen Jetta#A1|VW Jetta Mk1]] (17)
*[[Volkswagen Caddy]] ([[pickup truck]]) (14)
*[[Volkswagen Scirocco|VW Scirocco I]] (53)
*[[Volkswagen Scirocco|VW Scirocco II]] (53B)

==A2==
'''A2''' platform cars (''Typ'' numbers in brackets):
*[[Volkswagen Corrado]] (53I) (hybrid platform with B3)
*[[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|VW Golf Mk2]] (19E)
*[[Volkswagen Jetta#A2|VW Jetta II]] (19E)
*[[SEAT Toledo#1L|SEAT Toledo Mk1]] (1L)
*[[Chery A15]]

==A3==
'''A3''' platform cars (''Typ'' numbers in brackets):
*[[Volkswagen Golf Mk3|VW Golf Mk3/Cabrio]] (1H/1E)
*[[Volkswagen Jetta#A3|VW Jetta/Vento III]] (1H)

The smaller [[Volkswagen Group A0 platform#A03|A03 platform]], used in the VW Polo (6N) and SEAT Ibiza (6K) is based on the A3 platform as well, and shares many components.

==A4 (PQ34){{anchors|A4|PQ34}}==
'''A4''' platform cars (''Typ'' numbers in brackets):
*[[Audi A3#8L|Audi A3 Mk1]] (8L)
*[[Audi TT#8N|Audi TT Mk1]] (8N)
*[[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|VW Golf Mk4/VW R32]] (1J)
*[[Volkswagen Jetta#A4|VW Bora/Jetta IV]] (1J)
*[[Shanghai-Volkswagen Lavida|VW Lavida]]
*[[Volkswagen New Beetle|VW New Beetle]] (1C/1Y/9C)
*[[SEAT León#1M|SEAT León Mk1]] (1M)
*[[SEAT Toledo#1M|SEAT Toledo Mk2]] (1M)
*[[Škoda Octavia#1U|Škoda Octavia Mk1]] (1U)

==A5 (PQ35){{anchors|A5|PQ35|PQ46}}==
The '''PQ35''' platform is designed to be more modular and flexible than previous A platforms.  For the first time, a fully [[independent suspension]] front and rear will be present in all A platform vehicles.  There is also a derivative version of this platform for 'B'-class cars (with larger variations expected in the future) called '''[[Volkswagen Group B platform#PQ46|PQ46]]'''.

PQ35 is intended for compact-size vehicles, and PQ46 is an enlarged version for mid-size vehicles, such as the [[Volkswagen Passat]].  A common misconception is that the PQ46 generation of the Passat is based on the "B6" (PL46) platform.  However, this transverse-engined Passat has little in common with the longitudinal-engined "B6" [[Audi A4]].

Current and expected PQ35 platform cars (''Typ'' numbers in brackets):
*[[Audi A3#8P|Audi A3 Mk2]] (8P)
*[[Volkswagen Touran]] (1T)
*[[Volkswagen Caddy]] (2K)
*[[SEAT Altea]] (5P)
*[[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Volkswagen Golf Mk5 / GTI / R32 / Rabbit Mk5]] (1K)
