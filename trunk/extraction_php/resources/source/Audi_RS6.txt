The '''Audi RS6 quattro''', commonly referred to as the '''RS6''', is a [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[luxury vehicle|luxury]] [[executive car]], [[automotive engineering|produced]] by [[Audi|Audi AG's]] high performance private subsidiary company '''[[quattro GmbH|quattro&nbsp;GmbH]]''', for the Audi [[marque]], which is part of the [[Volkswagen Group]].  Available for limited [[time scale]]s, the RS6 is the highest performing version, and top-of-the-line specification of the [[Audi A6]] [[car model|model range]], positioned distinctly above the [[Audi S6]].

Both versions of the RS6 are, or have been produced as a five-[[vehicle door|door]] five-[[car seat|seat]] "Avant", Audi's name for a [[station wagon|estate car/station wagon]], along with a four-door five-seat [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]].  Furthermore, their [[internal combustion engine]]s are all [[front-engine design|front-mounted]], and are [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally]] orientated.  The [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] is mounted immediately at the rear of the engine in a longitudinal orentation, in the form of a [[transaxle]].
__TOC__
The '''"[[RS]]"''' initials stand for '''''R'''enn'''S'''port'' (from [[German language|German]], literally translated to "racing sport", actually meaning ''"motor sport"''), and is Audi's ultimate 'top-tier' high performance [[trim package|trim]] level, positioned a noticeable step above the '''"S"''' model specification level of Audi's regular model range line-up.  Like all [[Audi S and RS models#RS|Audi RS models]], the RS6 pioneers some of Audi's newest and advanced engineering and technology, and so could be described as a [[halo vehicle]], with the latest RS6 having the most [[motive power|powerful]] [[internal combustion engine]] out of all Audi models, with more horsepower than the larger [[Audi S8]].  Furthermore, like all RS models, the RS6 is only available with Audi's 'trademark' [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.

The C5 RS6 was the fourth model to come out of Audi's private subsidiary company, "[[quattro GmbH]]".  The first was the [[Audi RS2 Avant]], from a [[joint venture]] between [[Porsche]] and quattro GmbH for the Audi marque.  The second was the [[Audi S6#Audi S6 Plus|Audi C4 S6 Plus]], produced from April 1996 to July 1997.  Third was the 2000 [[Audi RS4#B5|Audi B5 RS4]]; the fifth was the 2005 [[Audi A4#B7|Audi B7 A4]] DTM Edition saloon, and the sixth was the 2006 Audi B7 RS4.  The seventh and current (as of 2009) quattro GmbH model is the latest Audi C6 RS6.

Production of the original '''Audi C5 RS6''' began in June 2002 and ended in September 2004.  The second and current '''Audi C6 RS6''' was introduced at the 2007 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]].  The original RS6 was the first Audi RS model exported to [[North America]], while the succeeding C6 RS6 is only sold in [[Europe]].

Its main market competitors include [[BMW M5]] and [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG]].

[[Image:Blue Audi RS6 C5 sedan rr.jpg|thumb|Audi C5 RS6 quattro saloon (rear view)]]
[[Image:Grey Audi RS6 C6 Avant rr.jpg|thumb|Audi C5 RS6 quattro Avant (rear view)]]
[[Image:Audi RS6 C5 Intérieur.jpg|thumb|RS6 interior, showing leather-clad [[Recaro]] seats]]
The original '''Audi C5 RS6''' ('''''Typ'' 4B''') was the top-of-the-line user of the [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C5|Volkswagen Group C5 platform (1997–2004)]], and was initially available as a five-[[vehicle door|door]] five-[[car seat|seat]] Avant - Audis name for an [[station wagon|estate/wagon]].  A four-door five-seat [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] followed shortly after the launch of the Avant.  Derived from the [[Audi S6#C5|Audi C5 S6]] (itself derived from the [[Audi A6#C5|Audi C5 A6]]), the RS6 also shares the [[aluminium]] structure from the firewall and forward with the C5 A6s with [[V8 engine]]s (A6 4.2 V8 quattro, S6 saloon/Avant).  It was [[automotive engineering|manufactured]] from July 2002 through to September 2004.

Official performance figures for the Avant, whilst consuming the recommended high [[octane rating|octane]] 98&nbsp;RON "Super Plus" unleaded [[gasoline|petrol]] indicate the 0-{{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} dash would be completed in 4.6&nbsp;[[seconds]] (s), reaching {{convert|200|km/h|1|abbr=on}} in 16.8&nbsp;seconds (16.6&nbsp;s for the saloon).  Official figures state an electronically limited top speed of {{convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on}}, although most "RS" owners report that the speed limiter is rather liberal on all RS cars, with genuine 'limited' top speeds of {{convert|270|km/h|1|abbr=on}} being possible to achieve.  It should be noted that using a lower octane rated petrol, such as the standard 95&nbsp;RON "Premium" unleaded will reduce the engine power output, and have logical reduction in performance.

Luggage capacity, measured according to the VDA block method in the Avant ranges from 455&nbsp;[[litre]]s, to 1590&nbsp;litres with the rear seats folded down.  For the saloon, the boot holds 424&nbsp;litres.

===C5 powertrain===
For the C5 RS6 [[powertrain]] detail, the [[internal combustion engine]] is an all-[[aluminium alloy]] {{convert|4172|cc|1|lk=on}} [[twin-turbo]]charged ('biturbo'), twin [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshaft]] (DOHC), [[multi-valve|5 valve]] per [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] version of Audi's 4.2&nbsp;[[litre]] 90° V8 [[petrol engine]] (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#C5RS6|BCY]]), tuned with the assistance of [[Cosworth|Cosworth Technology]] (now known as [[Mahle GmbH|Mahle Powertrain]]).  With the addition of the two [[turbocharger]]s (one per [[cylinder bank]]), the rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output of the [[V8 engine]] was increased to {{convert|331|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 5,700 to 6,400&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], and generated {{convert|560|Nm|0|lk=on}} of [[torque]].  The combination of the 4.2&nbsp;litre V8, [[variable valve timing|variable inlet valve timing]], and twin turbochargers gave the RS6 an exceptionally wide [[power band]], with peak torque available from 1,950 to 5,600&nbsp;rpm.

Further detail of the engine includes fully sequential electronic [[fuel injection#multi-point fuel injection|multi-point fuel injection]] with [[manifold (automotive)#intake manifold|intake manifold]]-sited fuel injectors,<ref>Bosch Automotive Technology [http://rb-k.bosch.de/en/powerconsumptionemissions/gasolinesystems/manifoldinjection/index.html Manifold injection: Method of operation]</ref> mapped direct [[ignition system]]<ref>Bosch Automotive Technology [http://rb-k.bosch.de/en/powerconsumptionemissions/gasolinesystems/manifoldinjection/ignition/index.html Ignition]</ref> with solid-state high voltage distribution using eight individual single-spark [[ignition coil]]s and [[NGK]] longlife [[spark plug]]s, and three [[engine knocking|knock]] sensors.  Engine management uses a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]]<ref>Bosch Automotive Technology [http://rb-k.bosch.de/en/powerconsumptionemissions/gasolinesystems/manifoldinjection/motronic.html Motronic for manifold-injection engines]</ref> ME&nbsp;7.1.1 [[engine control unit]], which controls all functions of the engine operation; including fuel delivery, [[ignition system]], valve timing, emissions control systems, and torque reduction control - the latter operating in conjunction with the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;5.7 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]], as part of the "Anti Slip Regulation" (ASR) [[traction control system]].  The engine is compliant with the [[European Union]] Euro3 (EU3) standard, and includes two close-coupled primary [[catalytic converter]]s (CATs), two underfloor main CATs, and four heated [[oxygen sensor]]s which manage the [[cylinder bank]] selective lambda control.  This results in a [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions rating of 350&nbsp;[[gram|g]]/[[kilometre|km]] for the Avant and saloon in standard configuration.

It has an electronically-controlled five-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[ZF 5HP24 transmission#5HP24A|5HP24A]] [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] (parts code prefix: 01L, identification code: GAG) ([[gear ratio]]s - 1st: 3.571, 2nd: 2.200, 3rd: 1.505, 4th: 1.000, 5th: 0.804), with lock-up [[torque converter]] in all forward gears.  It has "hill detection" capability, and, despite many press articles stating that the gearbox was programmed to "blip" the throttle for downshift gear changes, no UK owners have ever found this feature to be present.  The [[transmission control unit]] [[electronic control unit|ECU]] incorporates "[[fuzzy logic]]" with its "Dynamic Shift Programme" (DSP), with the shift pattern adapting to suit individual driving styles.  'tiptronic' manual control can be achieved with either the floor mounted gear shift lever, or the steering wheel mounted 'paddles'.

The RS6 was only available with Audi's [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]], utilising the Torsen T-2 dynamic 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre [[differential (mechanics)|differential]] (diff), a modified unit which was being used in the 6.0&nbsp;litre [[W12 engine|W12]]-powered [[Audi A8#D2|Audi D2 A8]].  The torque from the [[internal combustion engine|engine]] is first routed from the gearbox output shaft to the Torsen centre diff, and then automatically divided and apportioned between the front and rear [[axle]]s.

The front and rear axle differentials (ratio: 3.197) are a conventional "open" type, but utilise an "Electronic Differential Lock" (EDL).  EDL is an integrated additional function of the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP) system, and works by monitoring and comparing the individual roadwheel speeds across an axle, and braking an individual wheel which is sensed to have lost traction (spinning), thus transferring torque across the axle to the wheel/tyre which does have grip.  "Anti-Slip Regulation" (ASR), more commonly known as [[traction control system]]<ref>Bosch Automotive Technology [http://rb-k.bosch.de/en/safety_comfort/drivingsafety/abs/tcs.html Traction Control System TCS]</ref> completes the Bosch ESP-related driver aids.

===C5 suspension and steering===
Utilising the same fully [[independent suspension|independent]] four-link front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and double [[wishbone]] rear, as its related [[Audi A6#C5|A6]] and [[Audi S6#C5|S6]], the RS6 was lowered by {{convert|20|mm|2|lk=on}}, with a 30% stiffer spring rate, and 40% increased compression damping.  The RS6 also served as the debut model for Audi's "Dynamic Ride Control" (DRC) system.  The DRC system is mainly mechanical, and uses a pump to provide additional pressure to individual [[shock absorber|dampers]] (shock absorbers) during cornering, acceleration or braking; to counteract rolling and pitching.  The system can adjust the stiffness at each individual damper constantly; to maintain both a comfortable ride on straight roads, and high level of poise and grip when cornering hard, accelerating, or braking.  The DRC's main advantage is that it operates without the need for complicated electronics, as required in similar systems from [[Mercedes-Benz]] and other competitors.  Its main drawback is that the DRC dampers have been known to fail (leaking fluid from the cross-linked circuits), which can affect the handling and ride quality of the vehicle; some owners have reported needing up to four replacements of faulty DRC units under the RS6 factory warranty.

[[Rack and pinion]] speed-sensitive "[[power steering#servotronic|servotronic]]" [[power steering]] was also standard, with a ratio of 16.2, and a [[turning radius|turning circle]] of {{convert|11.4|m|1|lk=on}}.

===C5 brakes, wheels and tyres===
The front [[brake]]s feature fixed [[Brembo]] eight-piston [[monobloc]] [[brake caliper]]s, with four pads in each caliper, working with floating and radially vented [[disc brake|brake discs]], sized at {{convert|365|mm|1|lk=on}} in diameter, by {{convert|33|mm|2|abbr=on}} thick.  The rear features single-piston floating [[ATE]] calipers with integrated cable-operated parking brake mechanism, mated to floating and radially vented disc, sized {{convert|335|mm|1|abbr=on}} by {{convert|23|mm|2|abbr=on}}.  Front and rear brake calipers are finished in a high-gloss black paint, with the fronts incorporating the Audi "RS" [[logo]].  Both front and rear floating discs are held in by metal pins to the lightweight disc hub, and allow {{convert|1.0|mm|3|abbr=on}} of lateral thermal expansion from the hub centre.

[[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;5.7 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]],<ref name="Electronic Stability Programme ESP">Bosch Automotive Technology [http://rb-k.bosch.de/en/safety_comfort/drivingsafety/esp/index.html Electronic Stability Programme ESP]</ref> with [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS),<ref>Bosch Automotive Technology [http://rb-k.bosch.de/en/safety_comfort/drivingsafety/abs/index.html Antilock Braking System ABS]</ref> [[electronic brakeforce distribution|Electronic Brakeforce Distribution]] (EBD), and [[Brake Assist]] (BA) was standard fitment.

There were total of three [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM) [[wheel|roadwheel]] and [[tire|tyre]] types produced for the RS6.  In [[Europe]] and elsewhere, 19" wheels were standard, with an optional 18" package.  In the U.S. market, the 18" package was the only available offering.  An 18" winter package, with [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] SP Winter Sport M3 tyres (225/45&nbsp;ZR18&nbsp;95V) was universally available.

For 18" wheels, the standard tyre fitted was 255/40&nbsp;ZR18&nbsp;99Y with ExtraLoad (XL) rating.  This is often stressed, and is the only recommendation by Audi, as RS6 does weigh {{convert|1865|kg|0|lk=on}}.  Tyres which are not rated XL are not safe (nor legal, in most countries) for use.  Owners reported finding [[Continental AG|Continental]] ContiSportContact&nbsp;2, Dunlop SP Sport 9000, [[Michelin]] Pilot Sport PS2, and [[Pirelli]] P-Zero Rosso as OEM suppliers for tyres on the RS6.  However, according to [[ETKA]], the Dunlop and Pirelli tyres were subsequently withdrawn from official supply, and the Continental SportContact&nbsp;2 has been superseded by the SportContact&nbsp;3.  An additional tyre from [[Bridgestone]] has now been included as officially recommended fitment, the Potenza RE050A.

For 19" wheels, the standard tyre fitted was 255/35&nbsp;ZR19&nbsp;96Y&nbsp;XL.  However, there were debates as to how safe 19" wheels and tyres are,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} as the XL rating achieves a 96 [[tire code#Load Index|Load Index]] ({{convert|710|kg|0|abbr=on}} load rating).  In contrast, the 255/40&nbsp;ZR18&nbsp;XL will get you 99 Load Index, good for {{convert|775|kg|0|abbr=on}} per tyre.  Current officially recommended tyres from ETKA for the 19" rims only include the Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 and the Continental ContiSportContact&nbsp;3.

===C5 RS6 Plus{{anchor|RS6+}}===
[[Image:Black Audi RS6 C6 Avant rl.jpg|thumb|Audi RS6 Plus, showing the 'black optics' and anthracite alloy wheels]]
Between April and September 2004, there was a final limited run of an even higher-performance RS6, named the '''Audi RS6 Plus'''.  This had an increased engine [[motive power|power output]] (identification code: [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#C5RS6|BRV]]), and produced over {{convert|353|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 6,000-6,400&nbsp;rpm, with the same {{convert|560|Nm|0|lk=on}} of [[torque]] at 1,950-6,000&nbsp;rpm.  This additional performance was achieved with a new [[engine control unit]] (ECU), and two additional coolant [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiators]] behind the side-mounted [[intercooler]]s (these were standard fitment on the standard RS6 in hotter climate countries).  Official performance figures indicate the discipline of sprinting from standstill to {{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in 4.6&nbsp;[[second]]s.  The RS6 Plus carries on to reach {{convert|200|km/h|1|abbr=on}} in 17.36&nbsp;seconds, and has an official top speed of {{convert|280|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.

The RS6 Plus came with Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) as standard, and also included a no-cost option of "Sports Suspension Plus", which lowered the standard sports [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] by a further {{convert|10|mm|2|lk=on}} over the standard RS6.  A revised [[steering]] rack, with a reduced ratio of 14.3 for firmer steering feel was included, and resulted in a [[turning radius|turning circle]] of {{convert|11.7|m|1|lk=on}}.  The [[brake]]s now included cross-drilled discs.  The wheels were only available in the 9Jx19" '5-arm design' alloys, finished in "anthracite" (dark grey), with 255/35&nbsp;ZR19&nbsp;96Y&nbsp;XL tyres.

The car was available only as an Avant, and was sold only in [[Europe]]an markets.  Visual differences for the RS6 Plus included the "black optic pack", which consisted of black finish to the framing of the radiator [[grille]], exterior window trims, tailgate lower trim, roof rails, and exhaust tailpipes.  It quickly sold out once it was released (999 units total).  The last three digits of the [[Vehicle Identification Number]] (VIN) are reproduced on a plaque inside the car, displayed on the [[centre console]].

===C5 RS6 in auto racing===
[[Image:Audi RS6 Competition.jpg|thumb|left|Champion Racing Audi RS6 Competition]]
The RS6 was used in the [[North America]]n [[Speed World Challenge|SPEED World Challenge]] GT Series of [[auto racing]] for three years - 2002 to 2004, claiming the manufacturers' championship victory successively in all three years.<ref>Audi.com {{PDFlink|[http://www.audi.com/etc/medialib/cms4imp/audi2/company/financial_information/pdf.Par.0095.File.pdf 2004 - Touching]|1.98&nbsp;MB}}</ref>  However, the 2005 season proved difficult due to performance restrictions imposed on [[Champion Racing|Champion Audi Racing]] by the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA), with Champion deciding to run a different [[wheel|roadwheel]] diameter, and the trade off was reducing boost pressure.

The RS6 was challenged by a factory-backed [[Cadillac CTS-V]], but was still victorious.  Champion Audi Racing decided to pull the RS6 from the series, citing unfair rules and regulations that explicitly targeted the dominant Audis.

The second-generation RS6, now called the '''Audi RS6 5.0 TFSI quattro''' ('''''Typ'' 4F''') and based on the [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C6|Volkswagen Group C6]] [[automobile platform]], was launched in September 2007 at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. With [[automotive engineering|factory production]] starting in April 2008, it became immediately available in [[Europe]] from the same date.  As of July 2008, it is Audi's single most powerful car ever to be produced by the [[marque]],<ref>Audi UK - The New Audi RS6 - Pricing and Specification Guide, Edition 1. 02/08</ref><ref>Audi UK - Audi RS6 - Pricing and Specification Guide, Edition 2. 05/08</ref> and positions the car ahead of its main competitors, the [[BMW M5]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|Mercedes E63 AMG]] in terms of engine output.

The RS6 Avant will not be available in the [[United States|U.S.]] market. However, the four-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] version is likely to be offered in [[North America]]n markets.<ref>[http://paultan.org/archives/2008/08/12/audi-rs6-sedan-unveiled-details-and-photos/ Audi RS6 Sedan unveiled: details and photos] - PaulTan.org blog.</ref>

===C6 bodywork and styling===
The five-[[vehicle door|door]] Avant ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]]) version of the C6 RS6 was launched in April 2008, whereas the four-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] was available from August 2008. Constructed from steel in a [[monocoque]] (unibody) design, the RS6 uses lightweight [[aluminium]] for its front [[fender (vehicle)|wings]] (fenders) and [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] (hood).

Visually, the RS6 differs from its related [[Audi S6]], having flared front and rear [[fender (vehicle)|wheel arches (fenders)]], harking back to the original [[Audi Quattro]], to allow for a wider wheel track. It also has deleted the front fog lights to allow for larger frontal air intakes (for the two side-mounted [[intercooler]]s (SMICs), and additional [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]]s).  The ten (per side) front [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) [[daytime running lamp|daytime running lights]] (DRLs), found on its related [[Audi S6#C6|Audi C6 S6]] adjacent to the fog lamps in the lower front bumper - are now found within the main headlamp housing on the RS6.  LED lighting technology is also implemented in the rear lights.  The new RS6 also includes [[headlamp#advanced front-lighting system (AFS)|adaptive headlights]], which swivel around corners in conjunction with [[steering wheel]] movements.

Luggage capacity, measured according to the VDA 'block method' in the Avant ranges from 565&nbsp;[[litre]]s, to 1660&nbsp;litres.

===C6 powertrain===
For the [[powertrain]] detail of this latest RS6, the [[internal combustion engine]] (parts code: 07L, identification code: [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#5.0 TFSI V10 427kW (Audi C6 RS6 - BUH)|BUH]]) is what Audi claims the first all-[[aluminium alloy]] 5.0&nbsp;litre ({{convert|4991|cc|abbr=on|lk=on}}) 90° V10 [[twin-turbo]]charged ("biturbo"), [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), with a [[dry sump]] lubrication system.  It has [[multi-valve|four valves]] per [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], with twin [[chain]]-driven [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshafts]] (2xDOHC), and [[variable valve timing]]<ref>Bosch Automotive Technology [http://rb-k.bosch.de/en/powerconsumptionemissions/gasolinesystems/direct_gasoline_injection/variablevalvetiming.html Variable valve timing direct gasoline injection]</ref> for both inlet and exhaust camshafts.  Charged intake air is cooled with two side-mounted [[intercooler]]s (SMIC)s.  This [[V10 engine]] produces a [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] rated maximum [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output of {{convert|426|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 6,250 to 6,700&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], and generates {{convert|650|Nm|0|lk=on}} of [[torque]] from 1,500 to 6,250&nbsp;rpm.  Engine management is by way of two [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[motronic|DI-Motronic]]<ref>Bosch Automotive Technology [http://rb-k.bosch.de/en/powerconsumptionemissions/gasolinesystems/direct_gasoline_injection/di_motronic/index.html DI-Motronic for direct gasoline injection]</ref> ME&nbsp;9.1.2 [[engine control unit]]s, which act as "master" and "slave" concepts; two ECUs are required due to the high revs the engine can achieve.  It also uses mapped direct [[ignition system]] with ten individual direct-acting [[ignition coil|spark coils]], an electronic [[drive by wire]] throttle (Bosch "E-Gas")<ref>Bosch Automotive Technology [http://rb-k.bosch.de/en/powerconsumptionemissions/gasolinesystems/direct_gasoline_injection/egas/index.html Electronic throttle control (ETC/EGAS) for direct gasoline injection]</ref>, cylinder-selective [[engine knocking|knock]] control, and [[cylinder bank]] adaptive [[lambda]] control, utilising eight [[lambda sensor]]s.

A total of seven [[radiator]]s, and four electric [[cooling fan]]s are needed to cool the [[radiator (engine cooling)|engine]], and related components under the [[aluminium]] bonnet of the RS6.

This RS6 overtakes the position (in engine output) from the BMW M5, making about {{convert|70|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|150|Nm|0|abbr=on}} more than BMW's naturally-aspirated V10 engine.

Drive output passes through a modified [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[ZF 6HP26 transmission#6HP26A|6HP26A]] six-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] (parts code: 09E, identification code: KZQ or KZH) ([[gear ratio]]s - 1st: 4.171, 2nd: 2.340, 3rd: 1.521, 4th: 1.143, 5th: 0.867, 6th: 0.691), with shortened [[shift time]]s, with "Dynamic Shift Programme" (DSP) and "Sport" mode.  It has paddle-shifts mounted behind the flat-bottomed [[steering wheel]], similar in design to the [[Audi RS4#B7|Audi B7 RS4]].  The gearbox is set by default, in conventional automatic mode, to delay up-changes during acceleration, and change down earlier to maximise [[engine braking]].  Downchanges in all modes of operation include the [[Powertrain Control Module]] [[electronic control unit]] (ECU) "blipping" the Bosch "E-Gas" [[drive by wire]] throttle, for smoother shift changes.  The hydraulic [[torque converter]] includes a lock-up function in all forward gears, and is able to completely disconnect when the vehicle is stationary, thus saving fuel.

Like all [[Audi S and RS models|Audi "RS" models]], the RS6 is fitted with Audi's 'trademark' [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] as standard; with this version of the RS6 using the latest asymmetric dynamic 40:60 front-to-rear default torque distribution from the [[Torsen]] T-3 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]].  This latest incarnation of the Torsen quattro, first seen in the B7 RS4, can automatically dynamically apportion up to a maximum 100% torque to the rear axle, or up to 80% to the front, dependent on traction conditions.

The front and rear [[axle]] final drives are conventional "open" differentials (ratio 3.317), and use the Audi "Electronic Differential Lock" (EDL).  EDL is a part, or "function" of the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;8.0 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]],<ref name="Electronic Stability Programme ESP"/> which also includes "Anti-Slip Regulation" (ASR) [[traction control system]].  EDL does not 'lock' the differential in a traditional sense, but uses electronics to monitor individual roadwheel speeds across an axle, and merely applies the brake to just one wheel on that axle which is sensed to have lost traction (by rotating faster than the opposite wheel, beyond normal accepted deviations).  This braked wheel has the effect of transferring the torque across the axle to the wheel which is deemed to still have traction.

Official performance figures for the Avant: 4.6&nbsp;[[second]]s for the 0-{{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} sprint, 14.9&nbsp;seconds 0-{{convert|200|km/h|1|abbr=on}}, and top speed is electronically limited to {{convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on}}, with a factory option to derestrict the top speed to {{convert|274|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.  In standard form, [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions are rated at 333&nbsp;[[gram|g]]/[[kilometre|km]].  The saloon reaches 0-{{convert|100|km/h|1|abbr=on}} in 4.5&nbsp;seconds.

===C6 steering and suspension===
Like the previous RS6, and the B7 RS4; this generation RS6 includes Audi's "Dynamic Ride Control" (DRC) Sports [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system.  The system is mainly mechanical; using a pump to provide additional pressure in the diagonally linked [[shock absorber|dampers]] (shock absorber) during cornering, to counteract rolling and pitching.  The system can dynamically adjust the stiffness at each damper constantly to maintain both a comfortable ride and high grip.  On this version, it has a three-way level control, selectable from the [[Multi Media Interface]] controls.

The [[steering]] system includes [[rack and pinion]] speed-dependent "[[power steering#servotronic|servotronic]]" [[power steering]], with a ratio of 12.5, and a [[turning radius|turning circle]] of 12.2&nbsp;[[metre]]s.

===C6 brakes, wheels and tyres===
Standard [[brake]]s on the RS6 consist of cross-drilled, radially vented and floating iron [[disc brake|discs]], the front discs sized at {{convert|390|mm|2|lk=on}} in diameter by {{convert|36|mm|3|abbr=on}} thick, and the rears at {{convert|356|mm|2|abbr=on}} diameter by {{convert|28|mm|3|abbr=on}}.  The front discs are clamped by gloss black six-piston fixed [[Brembo]] [[monobloc]] alloy [[brake caliper|calipers]] incorporating the "RS" [[logo]], and black single-piston floating calipers, with integrated electro-mechanical [[hand brake|parking brake]] linkage actuating on the rear discs.  This electro-mechanical parking brake serves another purpose, it doubles as a full emergency brake whilst the car is in motion, by applying maximum braking effort to all four wheels, resulting in activating the [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS).

Optional "Audi ceramic" [[reinforced carbon-carbon#similar products|Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide]] (C/SiC) composite front brakes are available, only with 20&nbsp;[[inch]] [[wheel|roadwheels]], which use {{convert|420|mm|2|abbr=on}} diameter by {{convert|40|mm|3|abbr=on}} thick drilled, vented, and floating [[SGL Carbon]] composite discs, with grey painted eight-piston fixed [[Alcon Component Limited|Alcon]] monobloc alloy calipers with the "Audi ceramic" logo.

Irrespective of the type of disc construction, all brake discs are mounted via high strength steel mounting pins which connect the 'working' surface of the disc to lightweight alloy disc hubs.

A specifically 'tuned' "sport-biased" [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;8.0 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] is standard, and includes [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS) and [[electronic brakeforce distribution|Electronic Brakeforce Distribution]] (EBD), and [[Brake Assist]] (BA).  This ESP system has three user-selectable settings: "ESP-on" - the standard default full protection mode, "ESP-sportmode" (which turns off the ASR and EDL traction functions), and "ESP-off" (which fully disables all 'stability' and 'traction' related functions).

Standard [[wheel|roadwheels]] (in the UK) are 9.5Jx20&nbsp;[[inch]] '5-segment-spoke' design [[alloy wheel]]s running on 275/35&nbsp;ZR20&nbsp;102Y&nbsp;XL (eXtra Load) [[tire|tyres]] (rated at {{convert|850|kg|0|lk=on}} per tyre), with official supplies being either [[Pirelli]] P-Zero Rosso or [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] SP SportMaxx GT.  A no-cost optional 9.5Jx20 '7-arm double spoke' design (identical style to B7 RS4), or 9Jx19&nbsp;inch '10-spoke' design alloys with 255/40&nbsp;ZR19 [[Michelin]] Pilot Sport PS2 tyres.
