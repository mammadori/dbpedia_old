The '''Standard''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[automobile]] manufactured between 1911 and 1912.  The car was produced at [[Berlin]]-[[Charlottenburg]] using a [[rotary valve]] [[engine]] built by [[Heinrod]], which was unreliable and had not been fully developed; consequently, it was very unpopular.
