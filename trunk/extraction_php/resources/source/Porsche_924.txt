The '''Porsche 924''' is an [[automobile]] produced by [[Porsche]] [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] of [[Germany]] from 1976 to 1988. A two-door, [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] [[coupé]], the 924 replaced the [[Porsche 914|914]] as the company's entry-level model, and was the model that finally retired the [[Porsche 912|912]]. It was the first Porsche model powered by a water-cooled, [[FR layout|front-mounted]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] to make production, although the similarly-configured [[Porsche 928|928]] was designed before the 924. The front-engine, rear wheel drive arrangement was normal for most other manufacturers, but it was unusual for Porsche, who had previously only used mid or rear-mounted engines of a boxer configuration, all of which had been air-cooled.  

The first official appearance of the 924 took place in November 1975 (as a press launch rather than a motorshow appearance) at the harbour at La Grande Motte, Camargue in the south of France. The model was a success and not only helped to take Porsche out of financial ruin, but created the revenue stream needed to continue building and developing the [[Porsche 911|911]]. The 924 was replaced by the [[Porsche 944|944]] in 1983 in the US market, but continued to be produced until 1985 for other markets.

For the 1986 to 1988 model years the car acquired the powerplant from the 944 model and became the Porsche 924S.

==History==
The 924 was originally intended to be [[Volkswagen]]'s [[flagship]] coupé [[sports car]]. Volkswagen commissioned Porsche to design the car (VW project number 425), who developed a fresh chassis and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] that would work with an existing Audi [[Straight-4|I4]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]]. They also handled the suspension, and the interior and exterior design. Porsche decided on a [[rear wheel drive]] layout, and chose a rear [[transaxle]] to help provide 48/52 front/rear weight distribution. This slight rear weight bias, despite the front mounted engine, aided both traction and brake balance. 

Due to growing concern over the [[Arab Oil Embargo|1973 oil crisis]] and a change of directors at Volkswagen, they put the 425 project on hold, eventually dumping it entirely after their decision to move forward with the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] model instead. Porsche, which needed a model to replace the 914, made a deal with Volkswagen leadership, agreeing to buy the design for an undisclosed figure—some suggest 100 million [[German mark|DM]], others say 160 million—but most agree it was less than the amount Volkswagen paid Porsche to design it.

The deal specified that the car would be built at the ex-[[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] factory in Neckarsulm located north of the Porsche headquarters in Stuttgart, the Volkswagen employees would do the actual production line work and that Porsche would own the design. It became one of Porsche's best-selling models to date, and the relative cheapness of building the car made it both profitable and fairly easy for Porsche to finance.

The original design used an Audi-sourced four-speed [[manual transmission]] for the 924 mated to VW's EA831 2.0 L I4 engine, subsequently used in the [[Audi 100]] and [[Volkswagen LT]] van and producing {{convert|95|hp|kW|abbr=off|lk=off}} in North American trim. This was brought up to {{convert|110|hp|kW|abbr=off|lk=off}} in mid-1977 with the introduction of a catalytic converter, which reduced the need for power-robbing smog equipment. The four-speed manual was the only transmission available for the initial 1976 model. An Audi three speed automatic was offered starting with the 1977.5 model.  

European models, which didn't require any emissions equipment, made {{Convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. They also differed visually from the US spec model by not having the US cars' low-speed impact bumpers and the round reflectors on each end of the body.

A 5-speed transmission, available starting in 1979, was a "dogleg" Porsche unit, with first gear below reverse on the left side. This was troublesome and was quickly replaced for 1980 with a normal H-pattern Audi five speed. The [[brake]]s were solid [[disc brake|discs]] at the front and [[drum brake|drums]] at the rear. The car was criticised in ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine for this braking arrangement, which was viewed as a step backward from the 914's standard four-wheel disc brakes. However, four wheel disc brakes, five stud hubs and alloys from the 924 Turbo were available on the base 924 as an "S" package starting with the 1980 model year.

The overall styling was penned by [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] [[Harm Lagaay]], a member of the Porsche styling team, with the hidden headlights, sloping bonnet line and grille-less nose giving the car its popular wedge shape. The car went on sale in the USA in July 1976 as a 1977 model with a base price of $9,395. Porsche made small improvements to the 924 each model year between 1977 and 1985, but nothing major was changed.

[[J. Pasha]], writing in ''[[Excellence (magazine)|Excellence]]'' magazine, at the time, described the 924 as "the best handling Porsche in stock form".

While the car was praised for its styling, handling, fuel economy, and reliability, it was harshly written up in the automotive press for its very poor performance, especially in its US spec cars. With only 95-110 hp, rapid acceleration was simply not an option, but the Porsche name carried with it higher expectations. When the 924 turbo models came out, [[Car and Driver]] magazine proclaimed the car "Fast...at Last!"  The later 924S had performance on par with the turbo, but at much improved reliability, and less cost.   The 81 and 82 Turbos and the associated special variants are garnering interest in collector circles; however, the cars are quite scarce as of 2009.

==924 Turbo==
[[Image:Porsche 924 GTS - 2008 Rallye Deutschland.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Röhrl]]'s 1981 924 Carrera GTS driven during the [[2008 Rallye Deutschland]].]]
Porsche executives soon recognised the need for a higher-performance version of the 924 that could bridge the gap between the basic 924 and the 911s. Having already found the benefits of turbochargers on several race cars and the 1975 911 Turbo, Porsche chose to use this technology for the 924, eventually introducing the '''924 Turbo''' as a 1978 model. 

Porsche started with the same Audi-sourced 2.0&nbsp;L I4, designed an all new cylinder head (which was hand assembled at Stuttgart), dropped the compression to 7.5:1 and engineered a KKK K-26 [[turbocharger]] for it. With {{convert|10|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} boost, output increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|abbr=off|lk=off}}.
The 924 Turbo engine assembly weighed about {{convert|65|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} more, so front spring rates and anti-roll bars were revised. Weight distribution was now 49/51 compared to the original 924 figure of 48/52 front to rear.

In order to help make the car more functional, as well as to distinguish it from the naturally-aspirated version, Porsche added a NACA duct in the hood and air intakes in the badge panel in the nose, 15-inch spoke-style [[alloy wheel]]s, four-wheel disc brakes with 5 stud hubs and a five-speed transmission. Forged 16" flat wheels from the 928 were optional.

Internally, Porsche called it '''931''' (left hand drive) and '''932''' (right hand drive), much like the 911 Carrera Turbo, which had been "Type 930". These designations are commonly used by 924 aficionados.

The turbocharged engine allowed the 924's performance to come surprisingly close to that of the [[Porsche 911|911]] SC (180 bhp), thanks in part to a lighter [[curb weight]], but it also brought reliability problems.

Intense heat in the engine bay lead to short turbocharger life and turbo-related seal and seat problems. To fix the problems, Porsche released a revised 924 Turbo series 2 (although badging still read 924 Turbo) in 1981. By using a smaller turbocharger running at increased boost, slightly higher compression of 8:1 and an improved [[fuel injection]] system with DITC ignition triggered by the flywheel, reliability improved and power rose to {{convert|177|hp|kW|abbr=off|lk=off}}. 

After a successful sales run of both naturally-aspirated and turbo models, in 1980 Porsche surprised everyone and release the 924 Carrera GT, making clear their intention to enter the 924 in competition. 

By adding an [[intercooler]], increasing compression to 8.5:1 as well as various other little changes, Porsche was able to develop the 924 Turbo into the race car they had wanted, dubbing it the '''924 Carrera GT'''.

Visually it differed to the 931 in that it had polyurethane plastic front and rear flared guards, a polyurethane plastic front spoiler, a top mounted air scoop for the intercooler, a much larger rubber rear spoiler and a flush mounted front windscreen. It lost the 931's NACA duct in the hood but retained the air intakes in the badge panel. This more aggressive styling was later used for as motivation for the 944.

In order to comply with the homologation regulations, the '''924 Carrera GT''' and later '''924 Carrera GTS''' were offered as road cars as well, producing 210 and 245&nbsp;hp (157 and 183&nbsp;kW) respectively. Clubsport versions of the GTS were also available with 280hp, a factory included Matter rollcage and race seats. 924 Carrera GT variations were known by model numbers '''937''' (left hand drive) and '''938''' (right hand drive). 

The ultimate development of the 924 in its race trim was the '''924 Carrera GTR''' race car, which produced {{convert|375|hp|kW|abbr=off|lk=off}} from a highly modified version of the 2.0&nbsp;L I4 used in all 924s.  In 1980 Porsche entered 3 924 GTRs at the 24hrs of Le Mans they went on to finish 6th, 12th and 13th overall.  In 1981 Porsche entered a 924 Carrera GTP which used a highly modified 2.5 liter I4, the same capacity as the forthcoming 944. This engine sported 4 valves per cylinder and a single turbocharger to produce 420hp. This last variant managed a 7th place overall finish and spent the least time out of any other car in the pits.

Production of the 924 Turbo ceased in 1982 except for the Italian market which lasted until 1984. This is due to the restrictions on engines larger than 2 liters, putting the 2.5 liter 944 into a much higher tax category.

==924S==
[[Image:Porsche924S.JPG|thumb|Porsche 924S in Guards Red.]]
In 1984 VW decided to stop manufacturing the engine blocks used in the 2.0 924, leaving Porsche with a predicament. The 924 was considerably cheaper than its 944 stablemate, and dropping the model left Porsche without an affordable entry-level option. The decision was made to equip the narrower bodied 924 with a slightly detuned version of the 944's 163bhp 2.5 litre straight four, upgrading the suspension but retaining the 924's early interior. The result was 1986's 150bhp 924S. Porsche also decided to re-introduce the 924 to the American market with an initial price tag of under $20,000. 

1987 saw Porsche release the limited edition 924S Le Mans. Available only in Alpine White or Black, it had uprated suspension and cosmetically upgraded interior and exterior. In Le Mans spec, the S' 2.5 litre engine produced an additional 10bhp, taking the total to 160. The Le Mans also came with an electric sunroof as standard (normally an option). A total of 980 924S Le Mans were manufactured during the 1987 model year; 813 in black (the only colour available for the US market) and 167 white cars.   

In 1988, the 924S' final year of production, power increased to 160bhp matching that of the previous year's Le Mans spec cars and the base model 944 (itself detuned by 3bhp for 1988). This was achieved using different pistons which raised the S' compression ratio from 9.7:1 to 10.2:1, the knock-on effect being an increase in the octane rating, up from 91RON to 95. This made the 924S slightly faster than the base 944 due to its lighter weight and more aerodynamic body.

With unfavourable exchange rates in the late 1980s, Porsche decided to focus its efforts on its more upmarket models, dropping the 924S for 1989 and the base 944 later that same year.

==The Porsche 924 and motorsport==
The 924 has its own racing series in the UK run by the BRSCC and Porsche Racing Drivers Association. The Porsche 924 Championship was started in 1992 by Jeff May who was championship coordinator until his death on 10 November 2003. Jeff was also one of the founding members of Porsche Club Great Britain. 
In the United States, the 924S is also eligible to race in the [http://www.944-spec.org/ 944-Spec racing class].

==Top Gear==
A 924 was driven by [[Richard Hammond]] in the [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] £1,500 Porsche challenge in series 5 episode 6.
