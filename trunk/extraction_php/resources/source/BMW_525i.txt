== Overview ==

The BMW 525i has a spacious interior, good handling and advanced safety systems. Even though its acceleration is respectable, it has less power than most of its competitors, and is a good choice for those who feel that speed is not the deciding buying factor in a luxury car.

== Features==

'''Xenon Adaptive Headlights'''

When a driver is driving and makes a sudden turn or slightly curves the car on the road, the headlights will curve into the direction the car turned, this system offers outstanding nighttime vision. This system will be detected by sensors on the steering wheel angle. If the driver changes his angle turn to the left by turning the steering wheel, the lights will be adjusted with it.

'''Dynamic Stability Control'''

Dynamic Stability Control, known as [[DSC]], which includes Dynamic Traction Control, known as [[DTC]] provides better control on a slippery road. If the systems senses are over or under the limit, then the cars engine will reduce the speed and may even cause the car to brake to help the vehicle get under control and going in the specific direction.

'''Start/Stop engine button'''

The newer BMW version cars now can start with a touch of a button. This is as easy as follows.

1. Take the chip and place it into the open platform next to the Start/Stop engine button

2. Press the Button next to it to start the engine.
 
3. To turn off the car's engine press the button and then take out the chip in the platform.

'''Active Steering'''

This system provides better control on high speeds and on turns and is connected to the [[DSC]] achieving reduction in [[DSC]] brake intervention.

== Safety ==

The BMW 525i ranks highly in crash tests {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, in part because the driver's side has 3 to 4 airbags. The airbags will deploy from the front left and top left of the driver. The same in the passenger seat. The back seat is the safest place in the car. There, only two airbags will deploy, one from the left door and one from the right door.

'''''Note:''''' Rear door mounted airbags are optional.

== SOS Button ==

The vehicle can be equipped with an optional "[[SOS]]" button which, when pressed, will connect the user with a BMW call center.  Earlier BMWs included a road assistance service, but it required the use of a telephone.
