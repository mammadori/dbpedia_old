The term '''Samba''' in VW circles refers to a specific model of the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2]] bus which was manufactured with the highest trim level available.  A Samba is a Standard microbus with the addition of trim strips along the beltline, dash clock, etc. Another distinguishing feature is the appearance of small skylight windows embedded into the vehicle roof.  Samba buses began production in 1951 and were all fitted with a large Golde sunroof as standard.
