The '''Mercedes-Benz S-Class''' is a series of the largest [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]s produced by [[Mercedes-Benz]], a division of [[Daimler AG]]. The S-Class, a product of nine lines of Mercedes-Benz models dating since the mid-1950s, has ranked as the world's best-selling luxury flagship sedan.<ref>[http://www.motoring.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=864&fArticleId=2892338 New Merc S-class goes hi-tech]</ref><ref>[http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-7153-1-619015-1-0-0-0-0-0-9293-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html DaimlerChrysler - Mercedes-Benz S-Class Dominates Luxury Segment]</ref> As the foremost model in the Mercedes-Benz lineup, the S-Class has debuted many of the company's latest innovations, including drivetrain technologies, interior features, and safety systems (such as the first [[airbag#Rebirth: supplemental restraint|airbag]] supplemental restraint systems, seatbelt [[Seat belt#Pretensioners and webclamps|pretensioners]], and [[Electronic Stability Control|electronic stability program]]).<ref>[http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/mercedes-s-class-2005.htm  Mercedes 2005 S-Class to Keep Rivals Honest]</ref> The latest generation, the W221 S-Class, premiered in 2006 as an all-new design. As in previous iterations, the latest S-Class is sold in standard and long wheelbase versions and offers [[V6 engine|V6]], [[V8 engine|V8]], [[V12 engine|V12]], [[Diesel engine|diesel]] and [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] powertrains.

The name "''S-Class''" derives from the [[German language|German]] word "''Sonderklasse''" of which "''S-Class''" is an abbreviation. ''Sonderklasse'' means "special class" (or rather: "In a class of its own"), and in automotive terms thus refers to "a specially outfitted car." Although used colloquially for decades, the "S-Class" designation was first officially applied in 1973 with the debut of the [[Mercedes-Benz W116|W116]] model line. Since then, five generations of officially-named S-Class sedans have been produced.

Past two-door coupe models of the S-Class were known as SEC and later S-Coupe. In 1998 they were spun off in a separate line as the [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class|CL-Class]], however it will be re-designated as the S-Coupe when launching the mid-generational facelift/refresh of the C216 later in 2009 as a 2010 model.<ref>[http://dikarockz.blogspot.com/2009/03/spied-2010-mercedes-s-class-coupe.html Spied: 2010 Mercedes S-Class Coupe]</ref>

==Historical overview==
In early [[Mercedes-Benz]] history, the "S-Class" designation was used colloquially, referring to the letter "S" which designated most of the larger six-cylinder powered vehicles in the company's lineup (but not the luxurious V8-powered 600 limousine).

[[Image:Mercedes-Benz 220SE 1959.jpg|thumb|left|A 1950s W128 ''Ponton'', a 220SE]]
In some early cases, as in the [[Mercedes-Benz W180|"Ponton"]] model, the "S" was applied to vehicles requiring premium fuel ("Super" in Germany) due to the higher compression ratio and output of the company's top-of-the-line engines. These six-cylinder engines were available in the [[Mercedes-Benz W180|W180]][[Mercedes-Benz W128|/128]] chassis lines, Mercedes' first without a conventional frame, using a unitized body/frame construction. This line was introduced in the mid-to-late 1950s, and came to encompass the 220a, 219 (W105), 220S, and 220SE (sedan, coupe, and convertible) models. Both "Ponton" models were produced through the 1950s.

[[Image:Mercedes 230s h sst.jpg|thumb|right|A W111 230S ''Fintail'']]
In 1959, the "Ponton" body was replaced by the new 220Sb with "Einheitskarosserie" (standard body) with "Fintails", with the different six-cylinder "S"-versions of the [[Mercedes-Benz W111|W111]] mainly differing from the smaller 4-cylinder variant [[Mercedes-Benz W110|W110]] by a different length of the front, and the amount of chrome applied. Thus, the W110, introduced in 1961 as a predecessor to the modern [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|E-Class]], featured a shorter hood for the "economy" models 190c and 190Dc. The [[Mercedes-Benz W112|W112]], as 300 SEL with a longer wheelbase, was for the short period the top model of Mercedes, succeeding the baroque "Großer Mercedes" ("Grand Mercedes") 300, 300b, 300c, and 300d, which were often associated with chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]]. In 1965, the W111 line also added the 230S sedan.

[[Image:Mercedes-Benz 600 vl silver TCE.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mercedes-Benz 600]] model slotted into the range above the S-Class]]
With [[West Germany]]'s economy growing in the early 1960s, Mercedes-Benz saw the opportunity to build a much larger vehicle than hitherto, aimed mostly at an international market and [[head of state|heads of state]]. In 1965, the company introduced the luxurious [[Mercedes-Benz 600|600]] limousine (W100 series), which assumed the title of "Großer Mercedes". This model became a showcase of luxury and technology, being the most luxurious Mercedes-Benz to date and it can be viewed as an early predecessor of the modern [[Maybach]] models, rather than as part of the S-Class lineage, although certain techologies pioneered in this car did find their way into the smaller model. The 600's role the flagship of the marque was later assumed by the modern S-Class.

[[Image:W108 Bild03.jpg|thumb|right|Late 1960s W108 line]]
With "Fintails" being ''passé'' and dropped in favor of a look similar to the 600, the updated and larger [[Mercedes-Benz W108|W108]]/[[Mercedes-Benz W109|W109]] lines were introduced, which included the 250S, 250SE, 300SE, and 300SEL (long wheelbase) models. The W108/109 lines, which eventually supplanted the W111 lines, were not available with 4-cylinder engines, and thus established the distinct S-Class market position which continues to the present day. Since the debut of the W111 300SEL, each iteration of the S-Class has included short and long wheelbase models, with the latter models (such as the W109) typically being the most luxurious, powerful, and well-equipped, with the V8-powered [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3|300SEL 6.3]] marking the highlight.

[[Image:Mercedes w116 h sst.jpg|thumb|left|Large boxy rear lights of the 1970s W116, the first official "S-Class"]]
In 1973, Mercedes-Benz introduced the [[Mercedes-Benz W116|W116]] line, the first to be officially called the S-Class. The arrival of the W116 saw the introduction of much improved [[car safety|passive safety]] into the vehicle design, with features such as anti-lock brakes and a strengthened vehicle occupant shell. Also, the V8-engines of the 350/450 SE/SEL models were now regular options. Due to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], fuel efficiency was the major concern for the engineers, yet they still added also the [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9]].

[[Image:Mercedes-Benz 500SE.jpg|thumb|right|The W126, the most successful S-Class (US-spec example)]]
In 1979, the [[Mercedes-Benz W126|W126]] arrived, replacing the W116 line. The W126 brought much-improved [[aerodynamics]] to the S-Class, enlarged yet lighter engines with blocks made of aluminium. Coupé models based on the S-Class were reintroduced (380/500 SEC). It also introduced now well-known safety features such as passenger side airbags, seatbelt pretensioners, and traction control. It became the most successful S-Class design ever built and was produced for twelve years, its model cycle extended by the first-ever S-Class mid-cycle update.

[[Image:W140 Taxi.jpg|thumb|left|A 1990s W140 as German Taxi]]
The W126 was succeeded in 1991 by the [[Mercedes-Benz W140|W140]] line, which saw the car grow dramatically in its proportions, for which it received criticism. Also, more technology and numerous features were added in response to growing international competition.

[[Image:Black S 600 front.jpg|thumb|right|The W220]]
In late 1999, the smaller but roomier [[Mercedes-Benz W220|W220]] saw a renewed focus on elegance and style, with a more rounded shape compared to the preceding W140. The W220 was produced in a sedan version only; at that time, the W140 S-Class coupes had already been succeeded by the new [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class|CL-Class]] in 1998, models of which share basic design and features with the S-Class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2004-mercedes-benz-s-class-cl-class.htm|title=Consumer Guide. ''2004 Mercedes-Benz S-Class/CL-Class Snapshot''|accessdate=2003-12-21}}</ref> Since 2003, the traditionally [[rear-wheel drive]] S-Class also offered [[4Matic]] [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] in some markets.

In 2007, the current '''[[Mercedes-Benz W221|W221]]''' S-Class premiered, replacing the W220. This latest generation of the S-Class is slightly larger than its predecessor, with sharper exterior styling (most notably wide fender arcs) and technological improvements. New technological features on the W221 include an [[infrared]] [[Automotive night vision|Night View Assist]] feature and the latest Mercedes-Benz [[pre-collision system]]. The [[Mercedes-Benz W221|W221]] is the second consecutive generation of the S-Class to be solely produced in a sedan body style. In the U.S., base prices for the W221 S-Class range from $87,475 for the S550, $144,975 for the S600, $127,775 for the S63 AMG and $194,775 for the S65 AMG.<ref>[http://autos.yahoo.com/mercedes_benz_s_class_s550/ Yahoo Auto S-Class S550 official MSRP]</ref><ref>[http://autos.yahoo.com/mercedes_benz_s_class_s600-dealer_quotes/ Yahoo Auto S-Class S600 official MSRP]</ref>

[[Image:Mercedes S500 front.JPG|thumb|left|Current S-Class generation: the W221]]
Currently, most W221 S-Class models are built at the Daimler AG plant in [[Sindelfingen]], [[Germany]]. Founded by Daimler Motor Company in 1915, the Sindelfingen plant also produced the model 600 "Großer Mercedes" and past generations of the S-Class.<ref>[http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-535024-1-36826-1-0-0-0-0-0-12075-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html DaimlerChrysler - Home - Corporate Profile - Worldwide Locations - Sindelfingen Plant:]</ref> Previous S-Class models (such as the W126) were built in different locations ranging from Stuttgart to South Africa, but with recent models (such as the W220) production has been concentrated in Sindelfingen.

===Role of the ''Autobahn''===
[[Image:A74-D-front-250.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kraftwerk]]'s [[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]] LP, on the left side a S-Class "[[#.22Fintail.22_.281959.29|Fintail]]"]]Large stretches of the German [[Autobahn]] freeway system do not feature any speed limit except the ''recommended'' {{convert|130|km/h|mph|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Driving at rather high speeds for extended periods tends to result in increased strain on a vehicle and requires careful engineering. Mercedes-Benz has sought to engineer its vehicles, most notably the S-Class, to excel in this unique environment, allowing high speed cruising. Specific standards of engine performance, body integrity, and reliability are part of this process. For instance, the S-Class is built with an electronically-limited top speed of 250&nbsp;km/h (155 mph) , which drivers can maintain when driving on the autobahn. AMG Manufaktur also offers delimitation or reset to 300&nbsp;km/h (186 mph). Historically, the engineering of the S-Class has often occurred without regard to cost, a practice which continued unfettered up through the W140 line. The company in turn has been able to exploit this as a [[marketing]] tool, culminating in its onetime slogan, "engineered like no other car in the world." This slogan was used throughout the 1980s with the marketing of the W126 S-Class.

However, following the formation of [[DaimlerChrysler]] and the cessation of engineer-sanctioned overbudgeting in the late 1990s, this slogan was dropped; the subsequent W220 model S-Class also exhibited lower reliability and quality rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/17/autos/pluggedin_Taylor_Mercedes.fortune/index.htm|title=CNN Money. "Mercedes Vs. Consumer Reports"|accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref>

===Model nomenclature===
[[Image:S-Class titles1.JPG|thumb|120px|right|original order]]
[[Image:S-Class titles.JPG|thumb|120px|right|current order]]
In typical [[Mercedes-Benz]] fashion introduced in the late 1920s, the traditional designation of each car consisted of three numbers indicating engine size (up to 770 in the 1930s), and optional letters indicating either engine features ("260D" since the first Diesel of 1936) or body styles ("K" for ''kompressor'' (typically a [[Roots type supercharger|ROOTS compressor]]) as in the 1930s 500K or 540K). After World War II, these codes were often carried over from one generation to the next. The letters stem from [[German language|German]] terminology. For example, 500SEL denotes an S-Class (''Sonderklasse'') sedan with an engine size of about 5,000 ccm, with fuel injection (''Einspritzung'') and a long wheelbase (''Lang''). Note that the "S" and "L" in "SEL" are not equal to those in "SL" (''Sport Leicht''); the SL roadsters are not S-Class vehicles. In German, the flagship vehicles are referred to as ''die S-Klasse.''

Until 1982, there were only two lines. The new W201 ("Baby-Benz") was awkwardly called 190 no matter what engine was installed. As in earlier special models, the real capacity was indicated as e.g. "190E 2.6", in order to distinguish it from the mid-sized 260E, the mid-size five-door 260TE, and the "S-Class" 260SE using the same six-cylinder. In 1994, when the W202 was introduced as ''C-Class'', the traditional naming convention (numbers, plus letters) was reversed, with a leading letter identifying the line (currently, A, B, C, CLS, E, G, GL, GLK, ML, R, S, V are in use). From then on, the long-wheelbase models (formerly "SEL") and the regular length models (formerly "SE") are both labeled with the prefix of "S" regardless of length. For example, both 500SEL and 500SE are now labeled as S500, with fuel injection being standard by now anyway.

Currently, the S-Class is available in three trim levels; the numbers are given in ascending order to denote more upscale models (e.g. S550/S600/S63 AMG etc.) In official Mercedes-Benz publications and on vehicle nameplates, a space between the letter and numbers is customary (e.g. S&nbsp;600).

The '''W180''' line debuted in 1954, and is the first lineup of "Ponton" models associated with the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The W180 featured six-cylinder sedan, coupé, and convertible models, and was produced until 1957. The later '''W128''' lineup was the last to be associated with the "Ponton" name, and featured sedan, coupé, and cabriolet models powered by a [[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|2.2L straight-6]]. The [[Mercedes-Benz Ponton|"Ponton"]] designation referred to [[pontoon fenders]], a stylistic feature on the W180/W128 models.

The "Ponton" lineup included four- and six-cylinder models, but only the six-cylinder W180 and W128 lines are considered part of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class chronology, as they were the most powerful "Ponton" versions available.

{{main|Mercedes-Benz W111|Mercedes-Benz W112}}

The '''W111''' "Fintail" series debuted in 1959. Initially powered by a line of [[straight-6]] engines ([[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|the M180 and M127]]), it set a new standard for luxury. In 1961, the [[Mercedes-Benz W111|W111]] series was augmented with a line of 3.0&nbsp;L straight-6 cars, the '''W112'''. The [[Mercedes-Benz W112|W112]] was the most luxurious model in the Mercedes-Benz lineup until surpassed by the [[Mercedes-Benz 600|W100]] line's model 600 limousines in 1963.  The W111/W112 lines contained sedan, coupe, and convertible models.

The Fintail was among the first cars in the world to have [[crumple zone]]s and [[disc brakes]], and for the top of range W112 models, an [[air suspension]]. The characteristic name referred to a styling feature on the rear section of the W111/W112 models, the ''Heckflosse'' ("Fintail") which resembled the larger fins then in fashion on American luxury cars produced by [[Cadillac]] and [[Buick]].

The larger W111/W112 Fintail models should not be confused with a smaller Fintail line, the [[Mercedes-Benz W110|W110]], which was also produced in 1961 (derived from the W111 line) and was essentially the predecessor of today's [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|E-Class]].

{{main|Mercedes-Benz W108}}

With the '''W108/W109''' series of 1965, the range received [[V8]] power for the first time. The [[Mercedes-Benz W108|W108]] line launched with an initial lineup of [[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|straight-6 powered]] models. The unusual high-displacement [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3|300 SEL 6.3]] V8 model was based on this body type. The W108 line was larger than the Fintail models it replaced, and also eliminated the characteristic design feature of the previous model.

During this period, the designation S or SE was used for short wheelbase models including 250S, 250SE, and 300SE. Long wheelbase models (extended by 4 inches in the back door) were designated SEL (L= lang or long). Since the advent of the W108 series, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has always included two wheelbase lengths. The more powerful 300SE and 300SEL models were the most luxurious versions of the W108 line, with available burl walnut dashboards, automatic transmission, and power windows.

In 1968, the W108 line dropped the 250S and 250SE in favor of S-Class models with the larger engined 280S (in carbureted form) and the 280SE (with fuel injection); the 300SE/SEL models were later offered with a 3.5 litre [[V8 engine]] (in both the SE and SEL form) and 4.5 litre and 6.3 litre V8 engines (in the SEL model only).

{{main|Mercedes-Benz W116}}

The '''W116''' series, produced from 1972 through 1979, was the first Mercedes-Benz model to be officially designated the '''S-Class'''. The [[Mercedes-Benz W116|W116]] S-Class featured a four-wheel [[independent suspension]] and [[disc brakes]]. The 280, 350, and 450 (4.5L version) models featured SE and SEL versions. Production of the W116 totaled 473,035 units.

The W116 models were large [[luxury car|luxury sedans]]. The W116 was larger on the outside than the [[Mercedes-Benz W108|W108/W109 series]] it replaced, but had similar interior capacity, as the additional bulk was driven by new theories on [[car safety]] and occupant protection in a crash. It was one of the first cars to be available with [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], a driver's [[airbag]] supplemental restraint system, or a [[turbo diesel]] engine.

The 450SE, then the most powerful model in the W116 lineup, was awarded [[European Car of the Year]] in 1974. Starting in 1975, the W116 was upgraded with a new fuel injection system in order to comply with revised exhaust emission standards in European markets. A slight power reduction was a result of this update, but in 1978, a series of further engine upgrades restored original performance levels under the new fuel injection systems.

The most notable W116 was the high-performance, limited-production [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|450 SEL 6.9]]. This 8-cylinder model boasted the largest engine installed in a postwar Mercedes-Benz up to that time. Every 450 SEL 6.9 featured a [[self-leveling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic]] suspension, and offered the ABS [[anti-lock braking system]] as an option from 1978 onwards.  Also, in the United States and Canada only, Mercedes-Benz introduced the economical but powerful 3.0 liter 5-cylinder turbodiesel in 1978, sold as the 300SD.

{{main|Mercedes-Benz W126}}

The '''W126''' series premiered in late 1979 as 1980 model (and 1981 in USA and Australia). The W126 line introduced a host of new safety features, and ushered in the next phase of Mercedes-Benz styling. The W126 '''S-Class''' was also the first luxury car to win the prestigious [[Car of the Year]] award from Australia's ''[[Wheels Magazine]]'', which it did in 1981. The W126 line lasted from 1979 through 1991, a production run of over twelve years. Total sales of the W126 S-Class sedans reached 818,036 units, with an additional 74,060 coupes sold. These sales figures make the W126 the most successful S-Class line in Mercedes-Benz history.

In 1981, the W126 introduced the modern [[airbag]], as patented by Mercedes-Benz in 1971, to the world as an additional measure of occupant protection. Other safety innovations on the W126 included passenger side airbags (in 1986), seat-belt pretensioners, and traction control. In the cabin, additional courtesy and reading lamps, along with heated seats and a more advanced climate control system, added to the luxurious interior environment. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard.

Although the top of range [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9]] of the previous generation was not directly replaced, the W126 carried forward the [[hydropneumatic]] suspension of the 6.9 as an option on the 500SEL. A new cruise control system was offered as well. Abandoning the [[Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class|roadster based]] coupes, the W126 introduced a two door variant, the SEC [[coupé]].
The longevity of the W126 S-Class model cycle was aided by a mid-cycle update in 1986, an upgrade which previously was not done in S-Class generations. During the update of the W126 model S-Class, a facelift was performed and engine upgrades occurred.

===Engines===
[[Image:Mercedes W126 500SEL Heck 1.jpg|left|thumb|The W126 500 SEL.]]
Powerplants on the W126 S-Class included straight-6 and V8 engines. Most sales came from the [[Diesel engine|diesel]] model in the [[United States]] and [[straight-6]] models in [[Europe]], although the V8 models were praised by contemporary [[journalists]]. During the W126 mid-cycle update in 1986, both the straight-6 and V8 engines were upgraded in several models to different displacement levels (six-cylinder upgraded from 2.8L to 3.0L, eight-cylinder upgraded from 3.8L to 4.2L, and 5.0L to 5.6L).

Notably, the 500SE has an interesting place in US history, despite not being offered in that country. [[United States|American]] demand for this particular car drove the establishment of a large [[Grey import vehicles|grey market]]. The detuned, yet very expensive standard US specification 380 SE/SEL/SEC/SL was underpowered, according to contemporary reports, so 25,000 units per year of the parallel import vehicle were sold in the early 1980s. That prompted then Mercedes-Benz of North America to lobby for the elimination of parallel import in 1988.

{{main|Mercedes-Benz W140}}

In 1991, '''W140''' series replaced the W126 line in the Mercedes-Benz lineup, and the first production model of the latest '''S-Class'''  rolled off the assembly line on [[August 6]] of that year. As with its predecessor, the W140 was the first of the "next generation" of Mercedes-Benz models to feature the company's new design theme. Following S-Class tradition, the car was available in two wheelbase lengths along with the shorter-wheelbase W140 coupé. Production totaled 4500,522 million units the s-class w140,and reduced total reflecting the inroads made by the newly introduced Lexus LS into the key US export market.
The W140 S-Class is often known as the last Mercedes-Benz to be "overengineered," a company trait which was costing Mercedes-Benz in product delays and overbudgeting. For the consumer, the W140 cost a considerable 25% more than the preceding W126. Intense pressure from competitors such as [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] led to the addition of more features and options as to set the W140 apart from the rest and to justify the higher price. The W140 introduced new innovations such as double-pane window glazing, self-closing boot lid and doors, electric windows with a jam-protection feature (lowering back down when encountering an obstruction), rear-parking markers (which appeared on the rear wings when in reverse), and a heating system which emitted warm air even after the engine was turned off.

In 1993, Mercedes-Benz model nomenclature was completely rationalized, with the SE/SEL/SEC cars becoming the S-Class and alphanumerical designations inverted (e.g. the both 500SE and 500SEL became S500 regardless of wheelbase length). In 1995, following the new Mercedes-Benz tradition of mid-life facelifts (first with the W126 in 1986), the W140 received a minor facelift. The clear turn signal indicator lenses on the front and rear were the most obvious changes. Headlamps were fitted with separate low and high beam reflectors. Following the mid-year facelift, the W140 coupé and sedan were each fitted with [[Electronic Stability Control]]. The W140 was to feature an [[air suspension]] as an option, but Mercedes-Benz was still perfecting the technology and chose to launch air suspension as an option in the next generation S-Class in late 1999.

{{main|Mercedes-Benz W220}}

In late 1999, the '''W220''' was introduced. The W220 '''S-Class''' was  completely restyled, with a body that was slightly smaller and lighter than its predecessor. Unlike its predecessor, the W220 was not the first model to feature the company's new design theme for the next generation of Mercedes-Benz. This honor was given to the [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class|A-Class]] when it launched in 1997. The new S-Class incorporated the new styling cues first introduced on the Mk I A-Class the year before (for example, the dashboard carried over the new styling details first seen in the A-Class). Despite being smaller, the W220 S-Class offered more interior space than the W140. Production of the W220 S-Class totaled 485,000 units, slightly more than the production totals from the W140.

As with each new S-Class, the W220 brought in new innovations such as Airmatic [[air suspension]] and Active Ventilated Seats (which used miniature fans in the seats to move air through perforations). A navigation system with center console-mounted screen display was introduced, along with the COMAND input control system. Other options included keyless entry and ignition, a radar-controlled [[Distronic]] cruise control system and a cylinder shut-off system called [[Active Cylinder Control]]. The [[4MATIC]] [[all wheel drive]] system was introduced to the [[North America]] market S-Class for 2003.

''[[Consumer Reports]]'' classified the W220 model's reliability as "poor," its lowest rating, and declared it one of the "least reliable luxury cars."<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/17/autos/pluggedin_Taylor_Mercedes.fortune/index.htm Consumer Reports - Mercedes W220 S-Class reliability]</ref> Build quality, however, was generally considered to be good. For instance, ''Forbes'' described the W220 S500 as "built remarkably well." <ref>[http://www.forbesautos.com/reviews/2006/mercedes_benz/s_class/s500/testdrive_3.html Forbes Mercedes-Benz W220 S-Class test drive]</ref> Early W220s were recalled for issues with the trunk spring and the hydraulic fuel line; there were no recalls for the 2005 or 2006 model years.

In 2002 Mercedes-Benz introduced the world's first preemptive safety system on the W220 with its first iteration of [[Pre-Safe]].

In 2003, the W220 S-Class received an exterior refresh with updates to the front fascia. The grille angle was adjusted to a slightly more upright position, and the xenon-discharge headlamps were given a new transparent housing, replacing the earlier opaque versions.  The front bumper's lower air intakes were also restyled. In 2005, the S-Class was the first vehicle to receive a TÜV Institute environmental certificate from the German Commission on Technical Compliance for environmentally friendly components.<ref name=award>[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2007/03/19/040722.html S-Class Voted Fleet News Luxury Car of The Year For Fifth Time]</ref>

[[Image:S65 V12.JPG|left|thumb|Introduced in 2005, the S65 AMG offered the most powerful engine ever available in the S-Class.]]
The W220 was available with more engine options than the W126 or W140. The range started with smaller 3.2L {{convert|224|hp|abbr=on}} V6 motor, which was superseded by an enlarged 3.7L {{convert|245|hp|abbr=on}} V6 in the S350. The S430 was powered by a 4.3L {{convert|279|hp|abbr=on}} V8 and the S500 was powered by a 5.0L {{convert|306|hp|abbr=on}} V8. The S55 AMG was outfitted with a supercharged 5.4L {{convert|493|hp|abbr=on}} V8 motor, the S55 AMG 2000/2001 was outfitted with the naturally aspirated 5.4L {{convert|367|hp|abbr=on}} V8 motor.

For one month in 2001, AMG produced the S63 AMG, which was sold in very limited numbers. The S63 was powered by a 6.3L {{convert|444|hp|abbr=on}} V12. An undisclosed number of were sold exclusively through AMG in European and Asian markets. The S65 AMG was introduced in 2005. Powered by a 6.0L {{convert|612|hp|abbr=on}} V12 twin turbo motor, the S65 was the most powerful S-Class, as well as the world's most powerful production sedan. The S65 had a 0 &ndash; {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 4.2 seconds and could reach {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} under 9.0 seconds.

{{main|Mercedes-Benz W221}}

The all-new '''W221''' was introduced in the autumn of 2005 at the Frankfurt International Motor Show, with export to other markets beginning in 2006. The [[Mercedes-Benz W221|W221]] '''S-Class''' made its North American premiere at the 2006 [[North American International Auto Show]] in January. The latest S-Class is slightly larger in all dimensions than its predecessor, and it features three newly developed engines with up to 26% power increase. The interior is completely new, all materials have been upgraded and make for a more luxurious ride, and the center console transmission gear lever has been replaced with a column-mounted shifter.

Models sold in North America are the S450 (2008-,SWB and Canada only), S550, S600, S63 AMG and S65 AMG; other models to be sold outside North America include the S280, S350, S300, S420 CDI and S320 CDI. The first W221 model released in North America and Japan was the S550 (called S500 outside North America and Japan), with the S600 arriving in the following spring.

The brakes continue to become more advanced with the new [[Brake Assist Plus]] system monitoring for an [[precrash system|impending collision]] and increasing braking if needed, while the [[Distronic Plus]]radar guided [[cruise control]] can now bring the car to a complete stop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesautos.com/reviews/2007/mercedes_benz/s_class/feature.html|title=Forbes Auto. "Smooth Sophisticate"|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> This system works in outdoor conditions; a test demonstration by Mercedes-Benz in a crash-test hall resulted in embarrassment for the company when a new S-Class crashed into the back of a stationary W220 S-Class, an incident later attributed to radar-confusing steel in this hall. <ref>[http://www.autospies.com/news/Technology-Failure-Embarrases-Mercedes-4453/ Autospies - Technology Failure Embarrasses Mercedes]</ref>

Upscale department store [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] offered 20 special-edition S600 sedans for sale in its 2005 [[Christmas]] catalog. All 20 cars, priced at [[United States dollar|US$]]145,000 each, sold on [[November 22]], [[2005]] in under seven minutes. The Saks-edition S600 sedans were finished in a mocha black exterior with an almond beige interior and were the first examples of the S600 to be sold to private owners. The S600s came with nearly every option standard. In 2007, ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'' named the W221 S-Class as one of its 2007 "All-Stars" over rivals from [[Lexus]] and [[BMW]],<ref name=allstars>[http://www.automobilemag.com/features/awards/2007_all_stars/0612_2007_mercedes_benz_s_class/ All-Star 2007 Mercedes-Benz S-class]</ref> and ''[[Car and Driver]]'' selected the S550 as the winner in a five-way comparison test of flagship luxury sedans, <ref>[http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/12087/2007-mercedes-benz-s550.html Car and Driver - Chauffeur Showdown]</ref> as did ''[[Motor Trend Magazine]]'' in July 2009 in a three way comparison test, with the other two competitors being the [[BMW]] [[BMW 7-series|750Li]], and [[Audi]] [[Audi A8|A8L 4.2 Quattro]]. The W221 S-Class was also the recipient of several other motoring awards (see [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class#Awards|following]]).

Standard features of the S550 include air conditioning w/dual-zone automatic climate controls, interior air filter, Tele Aid assistance system, navigation system w/voice recognition, power tilt/telescopic leather-wrapped steering wheel w/radio controls, cruise control, leather upholstery, heated 14-way power front seats w/lumbar adjustment, memory system, heated power mirrors w/driver-side automatic day/night, power sunroof, premium sound system, 6-disc CD changer, satellite radio, wireless cell phone link, universal garage door opener, automatic day/night rearview mirror, and power rear sunshade.
The S63 adds on heated/ventilated and massaging multicountour front seats w/automatic body-securing side bolsters, keyless start, power side sunshades, and power trunk closing.
The S65 and S600 add on night vision, heated wood/leather-wrapped steering wheel, adaptive cruise control, power panoramic sunroof, rear dual-zone automatic climate controls, 8-way power-adjustable heated/ventilated rear seats w/lumbar adjustment, alcantara headliner, and rearview camera.
Options for less expensive S-Class models include [[Night View Assist]], power panorama sunroof, power side sunshades, heated steering wheel, upgraded leather upholstery, rearview camera, multicontour massaging front seats w/automatic body securing side bolsters, 8-way power adjustable heated/ventilated rear seats w/lumbar adjustment, rear dual-zone automatic climate controls, power trunk closing, and ventilated front seats.

===Performance===
The S550 completes the 0-60 mph run in just 5.5 seconds. The car weighs about 2250&nbsp;kg, but S65 AMG still makes 0-60mph in just 4.2 seconds, comparable to many top of the line sports cars. The S 63 AMG and the S 600 makes the same sprint in about 4.4 seconds.

== Safety ==
Mercedes-Benz has traditionally introduced its safety innovations in the S-Class. For instance, the S-Class was the first car in Europe to incorporate airbags. S-Class safety features include the following innovations in [[active safety]] (accident avoidance), [[Automobile safety#Passive safety|passive safety]] (collision protection), and holistic safety (integration of both active and passive safety features):

*'''Active safety''': [[anti-lock brakes|ABS]] braking in 1978 (acts to reduce braking distances and improve stopping control; co-developed with Bosch); traction control and [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Program]] (ESP) in 1995 (improves driver control during difficult road conditions); and Brake Assist (provides full braking power during emergency stops). In 2005, a new infrared night vision feature was introduced (improves visibility during nighttime conditions). Despite the popular misconception, the S-Class was not the first car fitted with ABS braking technology, although some credit can be given for popularizing this now largely standard feature (ABS was initially an option on most models of the W126 S-Class).

*'''Passive safety''': crumple zones in 1957 (vehicle body structure absorbs the force of impact); three-point seatbelts in 1965 (provides additional torso/body protection); collapsible steering column (prevents the steering column from protruding into the cabin during accidents), strengthened occupant cell enhanced occupant protection during severe impacts (rollovers); pre-accident seatbelt tensioning (tightens seatbelts prior to impact), and sandwich platforms (allows the engine to slide under the occupants in a head-on collision).

*'''PRE-SAFE''', Mercedes-Benz's holistic safety feature, was introduced on the S-Class in 2002. [[precrash system|PRE-SAFE]] integrates multiple active and passive safety features for a "safety net" approach to vehicle safety by attempting to prevent accidents; if accidents do occur, ''PRE-SAFE'' aims to reduce occupant injury.  In the latest version of this pre-collision system, PRE-SAFE will prime the brake assist system, lock the doors to prevent accidental opening during the accident, adjust the seats, close the windows and sunroof, and tighten seatbelts during certain types of collisions.  In the event an accident results in a roll over, the PRE-SAFE feature unlock the doors and lower the windows approximately one half-inch to allow you to exit or safety workers to gain access easily.

Road accident statistics on a model-by-model basis from the [[UK]] Department of Transport show that the Mercedes-Benz S-Class is one of the safest cars on the UK roads (measured in terms of chance of death in an accident).


==S-Guard==

==Concept vehicles==
'''S-Class robots''': in the 1980s, [[Mercedes-Benz]] built the world's first [[driverless car]]s, together with the team of Professor [[Ernst Dickmanns]] at [[Bundeswehr]] Universität [[München]].<ref>[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/robotcars.html Highlights of robot car history with emphasis on S-Class robot car of 1995 by Ernst Dickmanns]</ref> The culmination of this effort was achieved in 1995, when Dickmanns' re-engineered autonomous S-Class [[robot]] completed a trip from [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]] to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] and back. On the [[autobahn]], the robot S-Class achieved speeds exceeding 175&nbsp;km/h. It suggested and executed overtaking maneuvers. The car's abilities left a big impression on many observers, and is said to have heavily influenced robot car research and funding decisions worldwide.

'''F700 research car''': a concept future hybrid, the F700 Research Car, was also unveiled at the 2007 [[Frankfurt auto show]].<ref>[http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId=101846&topicId=103840033&docId=l:676599248 Newsday - A hybrid drives Mercedes concept] </ref> The F700 featured three regular opening doors and a fourth door capable of 180 degree rotation.

== Awards ==
Recent generations of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class have been the recipient of different automotive awards, reflecting the vehicle's status as the world's most prestigious luxury flagships.  These awards include the following categories:

*'''Quality and customer satisfaction.''' From 1987-1990, with the W126 S-Class leading its sales, Mercedes-Benz received the highest customer ratings in the [[J.D. Power and Associates|J.D. Power]] Sales Satisfaction Index.<ref>Sanchez, Jesus. Mercedes-Benz Still Ranks No. 1 in Poll of New Car Buyers. ''[[The Los Angeles Times]], August 8, 1990</ref> In 1990, the Mercedes S-Class was the third-ranked luxury vehicle in J.D. Power's Initial Quality Survey, behind only the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] and [[Lexus LS]]. Versus an average of 140 problems per 100 cars, the S-Class averaged 74.5, nearly twice better.<ref>Lexus No. 1 in New-Car Quality Survey, ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'',  Jul 4, 1990</ref> The latest S-Class also tied with the Audi A8 (total) for having the fewest quality problems in the industry after 90 days of ownership, with just 72 problems per 100 vehicles in the 2007 IQS Ranking.

*'''Safety and security.'''
