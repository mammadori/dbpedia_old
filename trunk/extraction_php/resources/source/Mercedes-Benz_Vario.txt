The '''Mercedes-Benz Vario''' (model designation '''W670''') is a heavy [[van]] manufactured by [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Originally launched as the [[Mercedes-Benz T2|T2 (Transporter 2)]] in 1986, the Vario gained its current name when facelifted in 1996.  The T2 van, itself succeeded the [[Mercedes-Benz L]] van series.

The bodyshell remains relatively unchanged in this time. The Vario has proved a popular base [[chassis]] for [[minibus]]es and mini-[[coach (vehicle)|coach]]es, although the demand for minibuses has declined with new regulations requiring [[disabled]] access, although a bus with a wheelchair lift is now available.

The Vario is fitted with a type [[Mercedes-Benz OM904|OM904]] [[internal combustion engine]] (shared with the [[Mercedes-Benz Atego]]).
