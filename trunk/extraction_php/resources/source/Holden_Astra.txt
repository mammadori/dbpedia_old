The '''Holden Astra''' is a [[compact car]] that was marketed by [[Holden]], the [[Australia]]n subsidiary of [[General Motors]]. Spanning five generations, the original, Australia-only Astra of 1984 was a derivative of the locally-produced [[Nissan Pulsar]], as was the 1987 Astra. It was succeeded by the [[Holden Nova]] in 1989—another unique to Australia model line, Holden in 1995 reintroduced the Astra for the [[New Zealand]] market. This was merely a [[badge engineering]] exercise, as the [[Opel Astra]], from which the third generation Holden Astra was based, had been sold there since 1993. The following year, 1996, Holden discontinued the Nova line in favour of the Opel-based Holden Astra. This strategy has been in place ever since, with fourth and fifth generations launched in 1998 and 2004 respectively. During August 2009 Holden discontinued the Astra and replaced it with the [[Chevrolet Cruze|Cruze]], released two months prior.

The original Holden Astra, introduced in August 1984 as the LB series was a [[Badge engineering|badge engineered]] [[Nissan Pulsar]] (N12). The Pulsar, a [[Japan]]ese designed model, sold alongside the unique to Australia Astra line-up. The Pulsar for Australia was essembled in [[Clayton, Victoria]]; however, for the Astra the body panels were pressed at Holden's [[Elizabeth, South Australia]] facility. In a way, this was similar to the Pulsar-derived [[Alfa Romeo Arna]] sold in [[Europe]] at the same time. Unlike its Nissan counterpart, the Astra was only offered as a five-door [[hatchback]], with the three-door hatchback and four-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] [[Car body style|body styles]] omitted from the range due to fears they would overlap with Nissan's own Pulsar range. However, Holden's continuation of the [[Holden Gemini|Gemini]] sedan range supplemented this.

[[File:1984-1986 Holden LB Astra SLX hatchback 01.jpg|thumb|left|1984–1986 Holden LB Astra SL/X hatchback.]]

Powered by a Nissan-designed 1.5&nbsp;litre engine, also manufactured locally, this engine produced {{convert|52|kW|hp}} and {{convert|115|Nm|ftlbf}} of [[torque]]. [[Transmission (mechanics)|Transmission]] options were a five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or a three-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]. Compared to the N12 Pulsar, the Astra LB sported a distinctive [[grille]], the work of Australian stylist [[Paul Beranger]] housing the Holden lion insignia in the centre, Also unique were Astra-only [[Automotive lighting#Rear position lamps (tail lamps)|tail lamps]], badging and decals.

A revised LC model was released in March 1986. Unleaded-fuel requirements uprated the engine [[Engine displacement|displacement]] to 1.6&nbsp;litres, power by {{convert|0.6|kW|hp}} and torque to {{convert|124|Nm|ftlbf}}. Model and trim changes were also apart of the update, including a new grille insert, and the addition of an SL model positioned below the SL/X and SL/E levels.<ref>The Red Book Identification Manual, May 1987, page 65</ref>

The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the [[Monash University]] Accident Research Centre, found that first generation Astras (LB/LC) provide a "significantly worse than average" level of occupant [[Automobile safety|safety protection]] in the event of an [[Car accident|accident]].<ref name = "Used Car Safety Ratings">{{cite web | url = http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/safety/publications/2008/pdf/ucsr_08.pdf | format = PDF | title = Used Car Safety Ratings 2008 | publisher = [[Monash University]] | accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref>

=== Specification levels ===
Two trim levels, the SL/X and the SL/E were offered in the LB Astra series, although a basic SL model arrived in 1986 with the LC upgrade.
* '''SL''': entry-level model available upon the LC's introduction.

* '''SL/X''': introduced with LB series featured cloth trim, a digital clock and a combined [[Receiver (radio)|radio receiver]] and [[Compact Cassette]] player.

* '''SL/E''': added [[alloy wheel]]s among other features to the equipment list. However, the LC update saw the SL/E specification downgraded from alloy wheels to steel wheels with plastic [[Hubcap|wheel covers]].

For the second generation LD Astra, the [[Nissan Pulsar]] was again used as the basis. Unlike before, the LD was the result of a proper [[joint venture]] development programme. That is, Nissan provided the [[bodywork]] and Holden supplied [[powertrain]]s for fitment in both applications. Launched concurrently in July 1987, both the LD Astra and N13 Pulsar were offered in four-door sedan and five-door hatchback [[Car body style|body styles]]. Outside of Australia though, three-door hatchback and [[station wagon]] body variants of the Nissan were also available.

Both 1.6 ({{convert|55|kW|hp}}; {{convert|135|Nm|ftlbf}}) and 1.8&nbsp;litre ({{convert|79|kW|hp}}; {{convert|151|Nm|ftlbf}})  [[Engine displacement|displacements]] of Holden's ''[[GM Family II engine|Family II]]'' engine were offered in the Astra-Pulsar models. Badged as "1.6-" and "1.8 injection", respectively, the term ''injection'' denoted the utilisation of [[fuel injection]]. In 1989, all associations with [[Nissan]] were severed and a new agreement between [[Toyota]] was formed. This relationship, known as the [[United Australian Automobile Industries]] (UAAI) was a continuation of the [[Government of Australia|Austraian Government]]'s [[Button Plan]] that started with Nissan. Ironically, Nissan continued to use the Holden engines until 1991 before replacing their N13 Pulsar line with the N14, while at the same time entering a new model sharing alliance with [[Ford]].

The Used Car Safety Ratings evaluation from 2008 found that LD series Astras provide a "worse than average" level of occupant protection in the event of an accident.<ref name = "Used Car Safety Ratings"/>

=== Specification levels ===
Of the three trim specifications offered, the SLX and SLE nameplates no longer featured the "/" symbol, as in SL/X.<ref>Bebbington (1998), p. 151. "SLX and SLE nameplates no longer featured the '/' symbol (as in SL/E)."</ref> Besides this anomaly, the LD range mirrored that of the LC Astra:
* '''SL''': entry-level variant, available only as five-door hatchback, featuring the five-speed [[manual transmission]] and 1.6&nbsp;litre engine combination. The brake setup for the LD series Astra in any specification was a [[Disc brake|disc]]/[[Drum brake|drum]] setup, whereas the equivalent Australian Pulsars had four-wheel disc brakes as standard.

* '''SLX''': was the second tier variant fitted with the 1.8&nbsp;litre engine in coupled to either a five-speed manual or three-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The SLX also featured full plastic wheel trims, as opposed to the [[steel]] centre [[hubcap]] fitted to the SL.

* '''SLE''': was the highest luxury level on offer was the highest specification offered, available only as an automatic 1.8&nbsp;litre. The SLE was equivalent to Pulsar's GXE specification.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.redbookasiapacific.com/au/vehicle/vehicles.php?make=HOLD&family=PSASTRA&year=19880 |title=RedBook AU - Your site for New and Used Vehicle Prices - Holden Astra LD|publisher= REDBOOK.COM.AU| accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref>

* '''HSV Astra SV1800''': was a [[Holden Special Vehicles]] (HSV) tuned version of the LD Astra. Introduced in September 1988, most of the 65 or so examples employed the sedan body style. Upgrades from the standard Astra were limited to cosmetic and [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] changes, with both "Stage 1" and "Stage 2" suspension setups offered.<ref>Bebbington (1998), p. 151. "Late in 1988, HSV offered the SV1800 [...] which featured suspension and body enhancements. Available in stages 1 or 2, these were some of HSV's few four-cylinder variants."</ref>

In 1995, Holden began selling the Astra again in the [[New Zealand]] market. Imported from [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]]'s [[Ellesmere Port]] plant in [[Cheshire]], [[England]], this third-generation Astra model known as the TR series, was derived from the [[Opel Astra|Opel Astra F]] in [[Germany]]; Opel being another [[General Motors]] subsidiary. However, this was merely a rebadging of the existing Opel model that had in fact been sold in New Zealand since 1993.

Holden in Australia did not recommence the selling of Astras until 1996, after the dissolution of Australian Government [[Button Plan]]. This resulted in the collapse of [[United Australian Automobile Industries|UAAI]], the Holden-Toyota alliance, and as result Holden opted to return to marketing rebadged General Motors vehicles. Between 1989 and 1996, the Astra's role was fulfilled by the [[Holden Nova|Nova]], Holden's version of Toyota's [[Toyota Corolla|Corolla]].

Both sedan and five-door hatchback body styles of the Astra were available.

Like the two previous generations, TR Astras were assessed in the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings, and shown to provide an "average" level of protection.<ref name = "Used Car Safety Ratings"/>

=== Specification levels ===
* '''City''': was the introductory model featuring a driver's [[airbag]], [[Power door locks|central locking]], and [[power steering]]. The engine and transmission combination comprised of a 1.6&nbsp;litre engine ({{convert|74|kW|hp}}; {{convert|135|Nm|ftlbf}}) with a five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]].
* '''GL''': editions were fitted with front [[Automotive lighting#Fog lamps|fog lamps]], electric [[Wing mirror|side mirrors]] and a [[tachometer]] over the City, and also featured a 1.8&nbsp;litre engine ({{convert|85|kW|hp}}; {{convert|165|Nm|ftlbf}}) with the option of either manual or [[automatic transmission]].
* '''GSi''': was the sporty hatchback-only entrant, featuring dual airbags, [[alloy wheel]]s, sports interior trim and [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], along with a 2.0&nbsp;litre engine ({{convert|100|kW|hp}}; {{convert|188|Nm|ftlbf}}) coupled to a five-speed manual.

In 1998, the Astra was replaced again with a German-sourced version. Known as the TS Astra, it was equipped with either a 1.6, 1.8 or a 2.2 16V petrol engine and was offered in a City, CD, CDXi, the SXi and the SRi specifications. The SRi was three-door hatchback only, and the standard Astra was only available with a 1.8 litre 16-valve engine. The TS Astra was similar to the [[Chevrolet Astra]] of the [[South America]]n market, although only the latter received the sharper facelift — the European and Australian versions retained the softer curves of the original body.

The TS Astra model change followed that of the [[Opel Astra#Astra G|Opel Astra G]] range, including the sedan, hatchback and convertible. However, the Coupé by [[Bertone]] was not offered with a Holden badge. The drivetrain was identical to other cars in in the Astra lineup, and as such, was not a bona-fide sports car. Like the Astra A, the Astra B was available as a wagon in New Zealand, but not Australia. In 2003, a 2.0&nbsp;litre Turbo engine became available. The standard Astra was only available with a 1.8&nbsp;litre 16-valve engine, and lived on until 2005 as the Holden Astra Classic, alongside the new model. The philosophy behind this was for Holden to remain competitive in the market until the cheaper [[Daewoo Lacetti|Viva]] model was introduced.

In accordance to the [[Monash University]]'s 2008 update to the Used Car Safety Ratings, TS Astra models were rated "better than average" in the field of crash safety protection.<ref name = "Used Car Safety Ratings"/>

=== Specification levels ===
* '''City''': was the entry-level Astra.
* '''CD''': added [[power windows]] and a passenger's airbag. Alloy wheels were made as standard fitment in the MY2001 update from November 2000 onwards.
* '''CDX''': was the top-line luxury edition, introduced in 2002.

The fifth generation AH Astra, based on the [[GM Delta platform|Delta]]-platformed [[Opel Astra#Astra H|Opel Astra H]] came in September 2004 as a five-door hatchback only, selling alongside the [[Poland|Polish]]-built Astra TS sedan, hatchback and convertible. The sedan and hatchback TS Astra models carried "Astra Classic" badges, but were finally dropped in late 2005, replaced by the [[Daewoo Lacetti|Holden Viva]], a rebadged [[Daewoo Lacetti]]. Between 2003 and 2004, the Lacetti was marketed in Australia as a Daewoo before Holden withdrew the brand from the Australia due to unsustainable sales.

[[File:2008 Holden AH Astra (MY08.5) 60th Anniversary station wagon 01.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Holden AH Astra 60th Anniversary station wagon.]]

Like the previous generation, the AH series was found to provides a "better than average" level of safety according to the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings.<ref name = "Used Car Safety Ratings"/> At launch, AH Astras came with front- and [[Airbag#Side-impact airbags|side-impact]] [[airbag]]s as standard inclusions, allowing the Astra to receive a four-star [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] crash safety rating. Higher-specified models were able to achieve the full five stars due to the addition of standard safety equipment. 

Holden suspended importation of the Astra on 20 April 2009, citing currency fluctuations and commodity price issues.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2009-04-24 | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/29606/holden-suspends-astra-sales/ | title = Holden suspends Astra imports | publisher = Australian Car Advice | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}</ref> Holden's import cessation, which resulted in no Astras arriving during June and July 2009, coincided with the introduction of the [[Chevrolet Cruze|Holden Cruze]], reported to be the direct replacement for the [[Daewoo Lacetti|Holden Viva]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Blackburn | first = Richard | date = 2009-04-20 | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=62296 | title = Holden to ditch Astra? | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}</ref> On 31 August 2009, Holden confirmed that the cessation of Astra imports will remain of a permanent basis, with no intention of further imports of either the then current AH series or the next generation car.

=== Model year changes ===
* '''MY05''': the AH range expanded in August 2005 with the release of the Astra [[station wagon]]. 

* '''MY06.5''': revisions from June 2006 added head-protecting [[Airbag#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]] as standard equipment for the CDX. Also released was the [[turbodiesel]] hatchback, badged CDTi. Two versions of the diesel were offered: a 1.9&nbsp;litre version with {{convert|110|kW|hp}} teamed with a six-speed [[manual transmission]], and a six-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] model with an {{convert|88|kW|hp|adj=on}} version of the same engine. This was a first for the Astra in Australia, but not New Zealand where the Astra TS had previously been offered with a 1.7&nbsp;litre turbodiesel.

[[File:2007-2009 Holden AH Astra CD 5-door hatchback 01.jpg|thumb|2007–2009 Holden AH Astra CD 5-door hatchback.]]

* '''MY07''': models appeared in January 2007, coinciding with the release of the Astra SRi and Twin Top [[convertible]]. Both releases came with a 2.2&nbsp;litre petrol engine producing {{convert|110|kW|hp}}, available with the six-speed manual or four-speed automatic.

* '''MY07.5''': in April 2007 the Astra line-up received a facelift including tweaked front [[grille]] and lights on all models. The 1.8&nbsp;litre petrol engine also benefited from a power upgrade from {{convert|90|kW|hp}} to {{convert|103|kW|hp}}—an increase of 11&nbsp;percent. The 2.2&nbsp;litre engines available in the SRi, and Twin Top remained the same, as did the 2.0L turbo in the Astra SRi Turbo

* '''MY08''': changes from October 2007 saw the deletion of the five-door SRi, leaving only the SRi coupé, and the Twin Top with the 2.2&nbsp;litre engine.

* '''MY08.5''': minor, non-cosmetic update from May 2008 onwards. MY08.5 Astras received [[electronic stability control]] (ESC) as standard fitment across the entire lineup. ESC was previously limited to SRi and CDTi variants. This series also marked the return of the five-door SRi, although it was now standard with the 1.8 as opposed to the 2.2&nbsp;litre petrol engine previously fitted. This engine change also affected the coupé SRi variant, but not the Twin Top. The Astra wagon range was also expanded to include the diesel engine option available already on the hatchback. Although only offered with an automatic transmission, the diesel CDTi wagon marked the return of the Astra wagon to the New Zealand market after its discontinuation after the TS series.

* '''MY09''': The CD and CDX hatchback and station wagon variants reverted back to the black bezel projector-style headlamps.
