'''Barkas''' was the [[East Germany|East German]] manufacturer of small delivery [[van]]s and [[minibus]]es named the B1000.

The van was built in a new factory on the site of the former plant of the [[Framo (car)]] company in [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]], the old factory having been crated up and shipped to the [[Soviet Union]] as part of a larger war reparations package in the late 1940s.    The business had subsequently been nationalized by the [[GDR]] government.  [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]], named in 1953, recovered its former name, [[Chemnitz]], only in 1990, following [[German reunification]].

B1000 production started in 1961 and continued until 1991.  Originally the B1000 was powered by the 45 PS<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200219>{{cite journal| authorlink = Thomas Wirth (Bernd Ostmann - Ed)| title = Seefahrt mit 45 PS in zwei Takten: Bus-Unternehmen| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = Heft 19 2002| pages = Pages 168 - 170|date = date 4 September 2002}}</ref> three cylinder, two stroke [[DKW]] derived engine found also in contemporary Wartburgs.  Shortly before production ceased, model designation was changed to B1000/1, and the old engine was replaced by a 1.3 four-stroke engine manufactured under [[licence]] from [[Volkswagen]]. The B1000 was a remarkable van at the time; the unusually high loading capacity, two-stroke engine, front wheel drive, and semi trailing arms suspension differed from the more traditionally constructed vans in the West.

Comparisons with the [[Volkswagen Type 2#T1|Volkswagen van]] of the early 1960s were inevitable.   Its front-mounted engine made the Barkas easier to load and more variable in its configuration, with space for up to 8 passenger seats<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200219/>.   The vehicles were mostly produced for public service applications, with private customer delivery times in the 1960s stretching to heroic levels commonly associated with [[Trabant]]s, of between ten and fourteen years<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200219/>.

Being the only commercially available van in the GDR the factory offered many body styles; a flatbed, a panel van, a people carrier, a box van and an ambulance were all available.

Altogether 175,740 B1000s and 1,961 B1000/1s were built.
