The '''Mercedes-Benz 770''', also known as the '''Großer Mercedes''' (large Mercedes) was a luxury automobile built by [[Mercedes-Benz]] from 1930 to 1943.  It is probably best known from archival footage of high-ranking [[Nazi]] officials before and during [[World War II]], including [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Hermann Göring]].

The 770 was introduced with the internal code W07 in 1930. <ref name="oldtimer07">[http://www.autogallery.org.ru/m/mb77007.htm Oldtimers Gallery - Mercedes-Benz 770 W07(K) Grosser.]</ref> These cars were mainly used by governments as state vehicles<ref name="powercars">Robson, G. ''The World's Most Powerful Cars'' p. 100-101 Quintet Publishing Ltd. 1990 ISBN 1-85076-254-6</ref>. 

The W07 version of the 770 was powered by an [[Straight-8|inline eight cylinder engine]] of {{convert|7655|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} capacity with [[overhead valve]]s and aluminium [[piston]]s.<ref name="oldtimer07" /><ref name="powercars" /><ref name="HistAuto57">Ruiz, M. ''The History of the Automobile'' p.57 Gallery Books, W.H. Smith Publishers, Inc. 1988 ISBN 0-8317-6550-X</ref>  This engine produced {{convert|150|bhp}} at 2800 rpm without [[supercharger|supercharging]].<ref name="oldtimer07" /><ref name="HistAuto57" />  An optional [[Roots type supercharger]], which was engaged at full throttle, would raise the output to {{convert|200|bhp}} at 2800 rpm, which could propel the car to 160 km/h (100 mph).<ref name="oldtimer07" /><ref name="powercars" />  The [[Manual transmission|transmission]] had four forward ratios, of which third was direct and fourth was an overdrive.<ref name="HistAuto57" />

The W07 had a contemporary boxed [[Body-on-frame|chassis]] [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspended]] by semi-elliptic [[leaf spring]]s onto [[beam axle]]s front and rear.<ref name="powercars" />  Dimensions would vary with coachwork, but the chassis had a [[wheelbase]] of {{convert|3750|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and a front track equal to the rear track of {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="oldtimer07" />

117 W07-series cars were built.<ref name="powercars" />

==Series II - W150 (1938-1943)==
[[Image:Mercedes-Benz 770.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mercedes-Benz 770 (W150) saloon car]]
The 770 was substantially revised in 1938, resulting in the new internal designation of W150.<ref name="oldtimer150">[http://www.autogallery.org.ru/mb770150.htm Oldtimers Gallery - Mercedes-Benz 770 W150 Grosser.]</ref> The all-new chassis was made with oval section tubes and was suspended from coil springs all around, with [[independent suspension]] at front and a [[de Dion tube|de Dion axle]] at the rear.<ref name="powercars" />

The engine had the same basic architecture as that of the W07, but it had been tuned to produce {{convert|155|bhp}} at 3000 rpm without supercharging and {{convert|230|bhp}} at 3200 rpm with.<ref name="oldtimer150" />  The transmission now had five forward ratios with a direct fourth gear and an overdrive fifth.<ref name="powercars" /><ref name="oldtimer150" />  

In 1938 the Mercedes 770 is thought to have been the most expensive German passenger car offered for sale up to that time, though it appeared on no price list: the price was published merely as "auf Anfrage" ''(on application)''<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197619>{{cite journal| authorlink = B Busch (Ferdinand Simoneit - Ed)| title = Als der Fürerschein eine Mark kostet: B Busch blickt in den Rückspiegel: 1938 | journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

88 W150-series cars were built before production ended in 1943.<ref name="powercars" /><ref name="oldtimer150" />  

==Gustaf Mannerheim's 770K==
Of note in popular culture is the 770K originally owned by [[Marshal of Finland]] [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Gustav Mannerheim]].  Mannerheim's 770K was sold to an American collector after World War II.  It was featured in the motion picture [[The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel]] as Hitler's parade car.<ref>[http://www.mannerheim.fi/13_erity/e_auto2.htm Mannerheim's Mercedes Benz 770 F-Cabriolet]</ref>

In 1973, Mannerheim's 770K, erroneously alleged to have been the parade limousine of [[Adolf Hitler]], was sold at auction for $153,000, the most money ever paid for a car at auction at that time.<ref>[http://www.history.com/tdih.do?action=tdihArticleCategory&id=7143 This Day In History: January 6]</ref> This broke the previous record price for an antique car, which was $90,000 for [[Greta Garbo]]'s [[Duesenberg]] in the fall of 1972. Mannerheim's car passed that amount within its first minute on the auction block.  It  was sold to Earl Clark, a businessman from Lancaster, Pa, who wanted the car for a park called Dutch Wonderland. Another 770 sold at the same auction, sold for $93,000. Billy C. Tanner, an Alabama developer and George Wallace's 1964 campaign manager, bought it, but he could not secure financing to complete the transaction. Consequently, he sold his option to Don Tidwell, a mobile-home manufacturer.{{fact|date=January 2008}}

"Hitler's limousine" was referred to in [[The Simpsons]] episode [[Bart Carny]] and in the motion picture [[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]].

A 770 had been displayed at the [[Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino]].{{fact|date=January 2008}}

As of [[November 2009]], one of Hitler's 770Ks has allegedly been purchased for several million Euros by an unnamed Russian Billionaire. <ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/24/2751728.htm Russian Billionaire Buys Hitler's Mercedes: Report]</ref>
