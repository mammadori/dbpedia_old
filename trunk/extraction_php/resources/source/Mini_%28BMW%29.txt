'''Mini''' (styled as '''MINI''') is an automotive [[brand]] owned by the BMW group that has produced the successor of the original Mini since April 2001. {{As of|2008|alt=Currently}} three body variants are available: hatchback, convertible and Clubman.

==Overview==
The car, whose first generation was designed by [[Frank Stephenson]],<ref name="paternie">{{cite book | title=Mini | author=Paterick C. Paternie | isbn= 0-7603-1157-9 }}</ref> draws inspiration from the original Mini, which was manufactured by the British Motor Corporation and its successors from 1959 to 2000. The name of the car's brand, MINI, is all-capitalized to distinguish it from its predecessor.<ref name="MiniBrand">{{cite web | url = http://www.bmweducation.co.uk/coFacts/view.asp?docID=17&topicID=3 | title = BMW Operations and Production: Can you tell me more about the Mini? | publisher = BMW | accessdate = 2006-05-01
}}</ref> Development of the first generation had been done between 1995 and 2001 by Rover Group in Gaydon, United Kingdom and [[BMW]] AG in [[Munich]], Germany and was accompanied by continual contention between Rover and BMW. Especially the positioning of the car was contended. Rover wanted an economy car, whilst BMW supported a small sporting car and finally prevailed. In 1999 BMW assumed control over the whole project after BMW's [[CEO]] [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]] had left the company.<ref name="UARWR">{{cite web|url=http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/r50storyf.htm| title=Anglo-German Success|work=The Unofficial Austin-Rover Web Resource|accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref>  When BMW divested itself of Rover in 2000, BMW decided to keep the Mini project and to move the planned production of the car, from Rover's Longbridge plant,<ref name="UARWR" />  the former production plant of the traditional Mini, to BMW's Oxford plant in Cowley, Oxford, United Kingdom, in what was historically the Pressed Steel Company body plant.<ref>{{cite book

The 2001 to 2006 [[model year]]s included four [[hatchback]] models: the basic "Mini One", the [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-engined "Mini One/D", the sportier "Mini Cooper" and the supercharged "Mini Cooper S". In 2005, a [[convertible]] roof option was added. In November 2006 [[BMW]] released a re-engineered version of the Mini which is unofficially known as the "Mk II Mini".<ref name="MC2_Nov06">{{cite journal|title=Introducing the 2007 Mini Cooper S|journal=MC2 Magazine|issue=5|publisher=Barry Brazier|month=November | year=2006}}</ref> The Mk II is {{As of|2008|alt=currently}} available as a hatchback and a wagon (Clubman). The convertible was still based on the MK 1 until January 2009, when a Mk2 variant was launched.

In Portugal and Greece, the MINI One was powered by a 1.4 litre [[Straight-4|I4]] version of the [[Tritec engine]] but all other [[petrol]] powered MINIs used the 1.6 litre I4 version.<ref name="haynes">{{cite book|title=MINI Owners Workshop Manual July 2001 to 2005 (Y to 05 reg) Petrol|isbn=1 84425 273 6|author=Martynn Randall.|year=2005|publisher=Haynes|location=Sparkford}}</ref><ref name="bentley">{{cite book | title=MINI Cooper Service Manual: MINI Cooper, MINI Cooper S, 2002, 2003, 2004 | isbn=0-8376-1068-0 | year=2004 | publisher=BentleyPublishers.com | location=Cambridge, MA }}</ref> Since 2005, a soft-top [[convertible]] option has been available across the entire range.<ref name="MINIwebsite">[http://www.MINI.com/ Gateway to official MINI websites worldwide]</ref>

There are numerous styling and badging differences between the models, perhaps the most obvious being that the Cooper S has a distinctive [[hood scoop|scoop]] cut into the [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]]. The Cooper S also has twin exhausts which exit under the centre of the rear valance. The (non-S) Cooper has more [[Chrome plating|chrome]] parts than the MINI One and has a single exhaust. The MINI One D has no visible exhaust pipes at all.<ref name="MINIwebsite"/>

In some markets, such as Australia and the US, only the MINI Cooper and Cooper S are sold because the MINI One's engine was considered to deliver insufficient power to run an [[air conditioner]]—a necessary feature in those markets. Almost fifty percent of all MINIs sold in Australia and about seventy percent of those sold in the US are the top-of-the-range Cooper S model. Other models of note, sold in varying markets around the world, are the MINI Seven, MINI Parklane, MINI Check Mate, and MINI Monte Carlo.

The names ''Cooper'' and ''Cooper S'' echo the names used for the sportier version of the classic Mini, which in turn come from the involvement of John Cooper and the Cooper Car Company. The Cooper heritage is further emphasised with the ''John Cooper Works'' (JCW) range of tuning options that are available with the MINI. John Cooper also created a one-off racing model of the MINI Cooper S named the MINI Cooper S Works. This car features many extras which help to improve performance, such as a racing exhaust and air filter as well as uprated suspension. The car also has one-of-a-kind {{convert|17|in|mm|adj=on}} racing wheels.<ref name="anderson">{{cite book | title=Motoring: Getting the Maximum from Your New MINI | author=Gary Anderson; Don Racine | isbn=0-9765780-0-X | year=1982 | publisher=Enthusiast Publications | location=Los Altos, Calif. }}</ref>

[[Image:MINI2006Checkmate.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A 2006 MINI Cooper S Checkmate.]]
The "Mk I" MINI One, Cooper and Cooper S used a [[Brazil]]ian-built [[Chrysler]]-designed [[Tritec engine]], while the MINI One D used a [[Toyota]]-built diesel engine. In August 2006, BMW announced that engines would in future be built in the UK, making the car essentially British-built again, with final assembly at Cowley and the body pressings being made in nearby Swindon at BMW's Swindon Pressings Ltd subsidiary.

It uses a [[transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] four-cylinder engine [[front wheel drive|driving the front wheels]]. All four wheels are pushed to the corners of the body. The styling of the car, like that of the [[Volkswagen New Beetle]], is a retro design that is deliberately reminiscent of the original Mini with contrasting roof colours, optional [[Go-faster stripes|bonnet stripes]], optional rally lights and with black trim around the wheel arches and rocker panels that mimic the wide wheel flares found on many classic Minis.<ref name="paternie">{{cite book | title=MINI | author=Paterick C. Paternie | isbn= 0-7603-1157-9 | year=2002 | publisher=MBI | location=St. Paul, Minn. }}</ref>

The MINI One and MINI Cooper were available with a [[continuously variable transmission]] or with a conventional Midlands five-speed [[manual transmission]] (model year 2001-2004), later replaced with a [[Getrag]] five-speed unit for 2005 onwards. The Cooper S comes with a six-speed [[Getrag]] manual or (from the 2005 model year onwards) a fully [[automatic transmission]] with paddle shifters.

As standard, the MINI had a [[drive by wire]] electronic throttle, [[electronic brakeforce distribution]], cornering brake control and [[electronic stability control]] (standard or optional, depending on model and region) to improve control and handling in adverse conditions.<ref name="mundy">{{cite book | title=You & Your New MINI: Buying, Enjoying, Maintaining, Modifying | author=Tim Mundy | isbn=1-84425-028-8 | year=2004 | publisher=Haynes | location=Somerset }}</ref>

Adding a [[supercharger]] to the 1st generation Cooper S model required that the battery be relocated into the rear of the car - leaving no room for a spare tyre. <!-- This is a British car - and a British/English article about it - the correct spelling in British English is 'TYRE' - please don't "correct" it! --> Hence this model comes with [[run flat tire|run flat tyres]] as standard.

===Mk I Mini Convertible===
[[Image:1st-Mini-CooperS-convertible.jpg|thumb|250px|Mini Cooper S convertible, top-up]]
At the 2004 [[Salon International de l'Auto]], Mini introduced a [[convertible]] model which was released in the 2005 model year and available in One, Cooper and Cooper S versions.

The convertible roof is fully automatic - an unusual feature in such a small car - and can be opened partially to act as a [[sunroof]] whilst the car is driving at speed. The convertible model forsakes the rear hatch of the hatchback Mini - replacing it with a drop down 'tailgate' design reminiscent of the classic Mini and incorporating similarly prominent external hinges. The convertible also adds two small power windows for the rear seat passengers which are retracted automatically as the roof opens. The roof is made from a heavy cloth with many layers of insulation; the rear window is of glass and has a heater/defroster but no washer or wiper.

At the 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]], Mini introduced the limited edition of Mini Cooper S Sidewalk Convertible. It has a top speed of {{convert|215|km/h|abbr=on}}. It accelerates {{convert|0|to|100|km/h}} in 7.9 seconds. It has {{convert|168|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|N.m}} of torque.

===The Works GP Mini===
The last version to be made with the Tritec engine is the Mini Cooper S with John Cooper Works GP Kit, a lightweight, quasi race-prepped John Cooper works model. Hand-finished by Bertone in Italy, it was produced as a limited-production run of 2000 cars in 2006, originally with 444 of those ear-marked for the UK market (although ultimately 459 were sold). The GP features more bolstered front seats but has no rear seats, which along with reduced sound-deadening, deleting the rear wash-wipe, offering optional air-conditioning and making other steps to reduce the overall weight, resulted in a weight saving of around {{convert|40|kg}} over a Cooper S. Additionally, the car has enhanced braking, suspension, a smooth under-body and {{convert|218|hp}} from the John Cooper Works engine modification package. In place of the rear seats there is additional body stiffening and below-floor storage areas. There are many unique styling points such as the red door mirrors, a carbon fiber rear spoiler, unique body kit, bespoke (2&nbsp;kg lighter) 4-spoke alloy wheels and specialized badging. Available in just one color scheme, Thunder Blue with a Pure Silver roof, each car is individually numbered and features a decal on the roof along with a plaque on the dashboard. The last of the supercharged Minis and a genuine Limited Edition model, it is expected that the Mini Cooper S with John Cooper Works GP Kit will become a collectors' item.

===Prototype and concept cars===
{{Refimprovesect|date=December 2008}}
[[Image:MINI Traveller.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Mini Traveller concept car at the 2006 Detroit Auto Show]]
[[Image:Mini Kombistudie 2005 4.jpg|thumb|250px|Mini Traveller rear view]]
Rover first showed the Mini as the ACV30 concept car in 1997.<ref name="UARWR"/> This looked very different from the production Mini. It had circular headlamps, huge wheel flares and a much more rounded appearance overall compared to the production design.

Before the first sales of the new Mini, prototype versions were shown at the 2000 [[Paris Auto Show]]. These were essentially identical to the version that was finally sold except that the colours used ('Candy Blue' and 'Flamenco Orange') have never been used in production cars.

BMW demonstrated a hydrogen-powered internal combustion technology in some of their concept cars in 2000 and 2001, and Mini showcased a hydrogen powered concept car in 2001 at the Frankfurt Auto Show. The car differs from [[hybrid vehicle|electric]]-motor hydrogen concepts, such as the [[Honda FCX]] in that it uses a cylinder-based [[internal combustion engine]].

An all-electric Mini is in use at the British Embassy in Mexico that uses around {{convert|200|kg}} of Lithium Ion batteries. Three electric Minis were also made for use in some subway scenes in the 2003 movie ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'' to satisfy the subway authorities concerns over possible carbon monoxide poisoning. PML Flightlink developed a prototype series-hybrid conversion, called "Mini QED", replacing the drivetrain with an {{convert|160|bhp|abbr=on}} electric motor in each wheel and an efficient onboard gasoline generator.<ref>[http://www.pmlflightlink.com/archive/news_mini.html Hybrid electric cars, electric cars UK, electric vehicle conversions, hybrid motor vehicles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

With higher powered engines, the standard front wheel drive Mini tends to produce a high level of wheel spin - a [[four wheel drive]] would be a natural solution to that problem. [[Getrag]] demonstrated a four wheel drive version of the Mini in 2004.

At the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in 2005, Mini revealed a retro version of the classic "Mini Traveller" [[station wagon]]. Based on a stretched wheelbase with two side-hinged rear doors and separate rear seats replacing the split bench seat of the standard Mini. At the [[Tokyo Auto Show]], the same basic concept reappeared with some fanciful additions - a circular roof section could be removed to form a picnic table with four folding chairs. The rear side windows were replaced with fold-down storage containers containing cutlery, cups and plates. In [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit]], a further version was presented without the table and chairs - but with a radically restyled interior.

[[Image:Mini 3 coopers.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Mini Cooper S (2007+)]]
[[Image:MINI Cooper D interieur.jpg|thumb|right|Mini III Cooper D]]

Mini introduced a new, second generation of the car for the 2007 model year, Mk II Mini (or R56), on a re-engineered [[automobile platform|platform]] with many stylistic and engineering changes. The engine architecture is shared with [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]] and is intended to be more cost effective and fuel efficient. The engineering was done in the United Kingdom by BMW Group UK Engineering, in [[Munich]], Germany at BMW Group HQ and with external third parties.

The so-called "Mk II Mini" (echoing the 'mark number' naming convention of the classic [[Mini]]) was introduced in November 2006 in the Cooper and Cooper S trim and the range was completed in 2007 with the Mk II Mini One. For the first time, there was a diesel-powered Cooper available from April 2007, badged as the Cooper D.

Though the Mk II has a familiar look, every panel on the new car has been changed from the old model. New safety requirements mean that the overall length has increased by {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the front end raised and the [[turn signal|indicators]] have been repositioned inside the headlights. The headlights themselves are now fixed to the front quarter panels rather than being housed within the bonnet so that they are not raised up with it when the bonnet opens. The car features a restyled [[grille]] and larger rear light clusters. The Cooper S retains the [[hood scoop|bonnet scoop]] in order to keep an association with the outgoing model — although the relocation of the [[intercooler]] to the front of the engine means that the scoop is now purely decorative. In addition, the Cooper S no longer has the battery located under the boot floor, instead being found in the more conventional place. The [[Pillar (car)|C pillars]] are no longer encased in glass and have been shaped to improve [[aerodynamics]] and to reduce the tendency for dirt to accumulate on the back of the car. Much criticized for the lack of rear legroom, Mini added more space for rear passengers by creating sculpted cut-outs in the rear of the front seats. An engine start button replaces the conventional ignition key and, with the optional 'convenience package', the car unlocks itself automatically when the key is brought close to the car.

The Cooper and Cooper S models offer a new rear axle and [[aluminium]] components to reduce the car's weight and a Sports kit option comprising harder springs, [[shock absorber|damper]] and [[anti-roll bar]]s is offered with both variants. Another key difference is the introduction of an upgraded electric [[power steering]] system, the sharpness of which can be increased by pressing a Sport button in front of the gear lever (both auto and manual) - which also adjusts the response of the [[Accelerator (car)|accelerator]]. In conjunction with automatic transmission, the Sport Button also allows the engine to rev almost to the red line before changing gear.

As for engines, the [[Tritec engine]] has been replaced in the Cooper model with a {{convert|120|PS}} 1.6-litre [[BMW/PSA Prince engine|Prince]] engine with BMW's [[Valvetronic]] infinitely variable valve timing, developed on and with [[Peugeot]]'s core engine. It is reported in early road tests that this takes the car from 0–100&nbsp;km/h in a claimed 9.1 seconds (0-60&nbsp;mph: 8.5 seconds)<ref name="minicooperspecs">{{cite web | url = http://www.jbcarpages.com/mini/cooper/2007/specs/ | title = Mini Cooper Specs | work=JB car pages | accessdate = 2008-03-21}}</ref> and has top speed of {{convert|125|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Fuel economy of {{convert|48.7|mpgimp|lk=on}} on the combined cycle is nearly {{convert|8|mpgimp}} better. The more powerful {{convert|175|PS}} Cooper S replaces the [[supercharger]] with a new twin scroll [[turbocharger]] in the interests of efficiency, and will feature [[gasoline direct injection]]. Consequently, this engine does not feature Valvetronic. This engine also has an "overboost" function which temporarily raises the torque by {{convert|20|N.m}} under hard acceleration. As a result, 0–100&nbsp;km/h is covered in a claimed 7.1 seconds (0-60&nbsp;mph: 6.7 seconds),<ref name="minicooperspecs"/> and top speed is {{convert|140|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. It achieves similar improvements in fuel economy to the Cooper, returning {{convert|40.9|mpgimp}} combined. Both cars come with six-speed manual or automatic gearboxes. The turbocharged engine is the same (although with some French engineering modifications) as the one in the [[Peugeot 207]] GTi/RC.

From 2008, all Mini models are equipped with BMW's [[EfficientDynamics]] fuel-saving technology. This includes a start-stop feature shutting off the engine when the car is stationary (this is not available in 2008 Mini Cooper in the US market). When the clutch pedal is depressed the engine is restarted with electricity generated from Brake Energy Regeneration. The Cooper D model attains {{convert|74.0|mpgimp}} and emits 104 g of carbon dioxide per 100 kilometres. A Mini One D is a possibility in the future, possible attaining even better fuel efficiency and lower emissions of greenhouse gases than the Cooper D, which is itself quite comparable to the [[Toyota Prius]] for fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions (potentially better than the Prius at higher rpm). Efficient Dynamics is standard in all Mini models, making Mini the first automotive brand to have all models in its range as [[mild hybrid]]s as standard (Mini's parent, BMW, is still in the process of implementing Efficient Dynamics across its older models).

All models of the Mk II with optional DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) also include "Hill Assist", a feature which prevents the car from rolling backwards on an incline by holding the brakes on for 2 seconds after the driver lifts their foot from the brake pedal, allowing them time to engage the accelerator.

The interior of the Mk II echoes the style of the earlier model but is in fact a complete redesign. The [[car boot|boot]] of the new car has an additional 10 litres of load space. Other changes in design - both visible and otherwise - have contributed to the Mini's recently awarded 5 stars in the [[Euro NCAP]] tests. One example is the higher front [[bonnet]], which now complies with the European pedestrian collision regulations.

The old tradition of producing [[List of Mini limited editions|special limited edition Minis]] was also continued with the new Mini, such as the Mini Monte Carlo <ref>[http://www.icars.sg/2008/3/limited-edition-mini-monte-carlo/ Limited Edition Mini Monte Carlo]</ref> recently launched in [[Singapore]], which is a tribute to the old [[Mini limited editions#Mini Cooper Monte Carlo|Mini Cooper Monte Carlo]], a limited edition Mini to celebrate Paddy Hopkirk's return to the Monte Carlo Rally, 30 years after his original win.

The Mk II Mini is built by Mini's Production Triangle: Plant [[Swindon]] (body panels), Plant [[Hams Hall]] (engine) and finally Plant [[Oxford]], where final assembly work is completed.<ref>[http://paultan.org/archives/2006/10/16/mini-production-triangle-and-oxford-plant-tour/ "Mini Production Triangle and Oxford Plant Tour"], Paultan.org, October 16, 2006</ref>

===MINI Clubman===
[[File:MINI Cooper S Clubman 02.JPG|thumb|Mini Clubman.]]
The Mini Clubman is an [[estate car]] available in Cooper, Cooper S, and Cooper D variations. The Clubman models are identical up to the B-pillar to the hatchback models including the engines used and, although the car is longer, the suspension set-up at the back shares many of the same designs features. For example, the rear trailing arms are the same, as are the anti-roll bars. It is {{convert|9.5|in}} longer to accommodate more leg room and a larger trunk. It has double doors as a boot instead of a pull-up hatch. It also features a "Club Door" on the right-hand side for passengers in the back.

The use of the name "Clubman" for the Mini estate van is a break with classic Mini tradition. It was originally the name given to the 1970s facelift of the Mini which mostly resulted in a squarer front end. The classic Mini estates were named either "Traveller" or "Countryman". However, BMW did not purchase the rights to use those names.

The adverts such as ''Clubmanitis'', ''Etch A Sketch'' and ''Pinball'' are covered by this Clubman, but it's originally used on these adverts on British TV in 2005 for the [[Pontiac GTO]] coupe.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}

===MINI John Cooper Works (R56)===
Based on the John Cooper Works Challenge car, it is a version with higher output engine, and BMW's Dynamic Traction Control and Dynamic Stability Control.

Engine is rated {{convert|211|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}, achieved by reducing 
compression ratio to 10.0:1, and increasing boost from the Cooper S' 0.9 bar to 1.3 bar.<ref>[http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/hatchbacks/112_0810_2009_mini_john_cooper_works_first_look/index.html First Drive: 2009 Mini John Cooper Works]</ref>

The Mini Cooper body model is called John Cooper Works Hatchback (also called John Cooper Works Hardtop), while the Mini Clubman body model is called John Cooper Works Clubman, Convertible model is called John Cooper Works Convertible. Both cars achieve the same EPA fuel economy ratings as their Cooper S counterparts.<ref>[http://www.miniusa.com/#/learn/mpgCompare-m Mini fuel economy comparison]</ref>

The models were unveiled in 2008 [[Geneva Auto Show]], as 2009 vehicles.<ref>[http://blogs.edmunds.com/straightline/2008/03/2009-mini-john-cooper-works-2008-geneva-auto-show.html 2009 Mini John Cooper Works: 2008 Geneva Auto Show]</ref>

===MINI John Cooper Works CHALLENGE (2008-)===

When it was officially announced, BMW Group planned to built 500 vehicles at the end of 2008. The pilot project began in the US states of California, New York and New Jersey, with Europe being considered. The vehicles were rented under one-year lease with an extension option.

The [[vehicle glider]]s were built in Mini factory in Oxford, England, while batteries, electric drive and power electronics were manufactured in Munich plant. The components were then shipped to a specially equipped manufacturing complex situated on BMW plant premises where the electric motor, battery units, performance electronics and transmission would be integrated.<ref>[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/10/18/la-preview-officially-official-the-mini-e-does-it-use-a-tesl/ LA Preview: Officially, official: the Mini E!]</ref>

==Beer can exhaust==
The team of designers working on the 2001 Mini had finished the full-sized clay mock-up of the Mini in plenty of time for a presentation for the board of directors. Chief designer [[Frank Stephenson]] realised that the model did not have an exhaust pipe. His short-term solution was to pick up an empty beer can, punch a hole in it, strip off the paint and push it into the clay at the back of the car, which took just a few minutes. The overall design for the mock-up was so good that the board members told him not to change a thing, resulting in the distinctive exhaust tip seen in production cars.<ref name="paternie"/>

==MINI Financial Services==
In 2002 [http://www.miniusa.com/fs MINI Financial Services] was started as the captive finance company for MINI with the purpose of offering financial solutions to MINI buyers. Their products include traditional financing, leasing and the Mini Platinum Visa Card. [[Image:mini drag racer.jpg||thumb|Mini drag racer sponsored by MINI Financial Services.

[[Image:Minifsvideocap.jpg||thumb|Get the right kind of protection with [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grf_LPqdQKQ MINI Extended Motorer Protection.]]]


In October 2009 MINI Financial Services launched a suite of MINI protection products called [http://www.miniusa.com/protection MINI Motoring Protection]. This suite consists of:[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grf_LPqdQKQ MINI Extended Motorer Protection], MINI Tire 'N Wheel Protection, MINI GAP Protection.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grf_LPqdQKQ MINI Extended Motorer Protection], the extended service contract exclusively feature original equipment parts.  Additionally, MINI Motorers have flexibility with the levels of protection, term and mileage.  The products offer four tiers ranging from five to seven years, and from 70,000 – 100,000 miles and different levels of protection. 

MINI Tire 'N Wheel Protection is all-new and will replace MINI Motorer's tires, not repair unlike the competition.
 
MINI Guaranteed Auto Protection (GAP) adds an extra layer of protection in the event your vehicle is stolen or is involved in an accident involving a total loss.  In these situations, most insurance companies only reimburse the owner for the market value of the car.  This along with the insurance deductable can create a significant “gap” between what the insurer will pay and what is owed to the lender. MINI GAP offers protection against these unexpected costs.

==Internal designations==
All Mini models have R-series model numbers assigned to them. These are a legacy of the Mini's original development within [[Rover Group]]. The following designations are known:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://motoringfile.com/2006/10/03/mini-product-numbering-system-explained/ | title = Mini Product Numbering System Explained | work=MotoringFile | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref>

==Production==
The Mini is currently assembled at the plant at [[Cowley, Oxfordshire]] where 4,700 employees (referred to as 'associates') produce up to 800 cars each day (approximately 240,000 per year). The 16 country specific variants of the three main 4 cylinder petrol engines having been assembled at the [[Hams Hall]] Plant near [[Birmingham]] where there are 1,000 employees. Mini sub-assemblies and pressings such as doors are supplied by the plant at [[Swindon]] where 1,100 are employed and 280 pressed parts are produced using 135 [[industrial Robot|welding robots]]. The bodyshop at Cowley holds 429 robots assembling 425 body panels, the bodyshells are then moved to the neighbouring paint shop where [[paint robot]]s apply the 14 exterior colour options and optional contrasting roof colours. Final assembly at Cowley then involves the fitting of 2,400 components to produce the numerous variants that are available to order.<ref>"The Mini Production Triangle in the UK" - BMW Mini publicity leaflet</ref>

==Criticism==
[[Alex Moulton|Dr. Alex Moulton]] (designer of the suspension system for the classic Mini), spoke about the new Mini in an interview with ''MiniWorld'' magazine: "It's enormous - the original Mini was the best packaged car of all time - this is an example of how not to do it. It's huge on the outside and weighs the same as an [[Austin Maxi]]. The crash protection has been taken too far. I mean, what do you want, an armoured car? It is an irrelevance insofar as it has no part in the Mini story."<ref name="Moulton">{{cite web | url = http://www.mgfcar.de/hydragas/moulton.htm | title = Alex Moulton | publisher = MiniWorld | accessdate = April 24, 2006
}}</ref>

Critics{{Who|date=December 2008}} of the new Mini also cite the fact that it is 60&nbsp;cm (two feet) longer, 30&nbsp;cm (one foot) wider and almost twice the weight of the classic car - yet it has less rear leg room and less luggage space. Much of this is to do with modern crash protection requirements and the desire to incorporate features such as air conditioning, a supercharged engine, modern emissions controls and a higher level of front-seat comfort than the classic Mini was capable of.

First generation [[convertible]] owners frequently criticise the poor rear visibility in the convertible. With the roof up the wide areas of cloth down the sides of the car block visibility to the rear quarters and the lack of washer/wiper on the small rear window - combined with the tendency of all flat-backed cars to accumulate dirt on the rear - effectively eliminates all rear visibility. Even with the roof down, the large roll-protection bars above the back seats and the bunched up cloth of the folded roof tends to block a significant fraction of rearward visibility. In an attempt to counter this problem when reversing the car, the Mini convertible comes with rear-mounted proximity sensors as standard equipment (these are an optional extra on the hatchback Mini). In designing the second generation car, Mini responded to these issues by using pop up roll-bars, and larger rear window.

The rear (club) door of the MINI Clubman is on the starboard side of the car, regardless of the intended market.  This means that in RHD markets (including the car's home market), the rear door is on the road side of the car, requiring rear passengers to exit into the road.

==Marketing==
[[Image:Batboy Steals MINI.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mini paid for this [[Weekly World News]] story as a part of an advertising campaign in 2003]]
During the production of first generation Mini, as a joke and undoubtedly as a part of Mini's [[viral marketing]] approach, purchasers of the Mini convertible were asked to sign a "contract" promising that they would drive the car with the roof open at least 90% of the time. Mini also set up a telephone hotline (in the USA: 1-888-DO NOT CLOSE) which one may call to report convertible owners who are driving with the roof up inappropriately. The automated system offers such helpful advice as how to administer a [[wedgie]] to the offender.

[[Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners]], Mini's advertising agency, produced a video series called [[Hammer & Coop]], directed by [[Todd Phillips]] as part of an ad campaign for the Mini.<ref>{{cite web|last=Filipponio |first=Frank |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/02/20/hammer-and-coop-episodes-1-and-2/ |title=Hammer & Coop: Episodes 1 & 2 |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref>

[[Crispin Porter + Bogusky]], Mini's advertising agency, produced a movie called ''Counterfeit Mini Coopers'' as part of the ad campaign.<ref>[http://theory.isthereason.com/?p=463 Video: Counter Counterfeit Mini Coopers]</ref>

To advertise Mini Clubman's introduction to Chinese market, Beijing Mini offered a Mini [[Rickshaw]], which uses the rear half of Mini Clubman.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2008/08/08/mini-clubman-rickshaws-running-around-beijing/ Mini Clubman Rickshaws running around Beijing]</ref>

In New Zealand, Mini sponsored ''[[Mad Men]]'', broadcast on [[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime]]. Special spots were created; for the first season, these took the form of a [[satirical]], sexist 60s-style television commercial. For the second season, the spot was a [[pastiche]] of ''Mad Men'''s opening credits, with a silhouette figure tumbling out of an office building, landing in the driver's seat of a Mini.

==Awards and popularity==
[[Image:MINI at premiere of the italian job.jpg||thumb|Mini owners were invited to bring their cars to the world premiere of ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'']]

Featured notably in [[The Italian Job (2003 film)|the 2003 remake of ''The Italian Job'']], the  Mini Cooper/Cooper S won the [[North American Car of the Year]] award for 2003.<ref name="robson">{{cite book | title=New Mini | author=Graham Robson | isbn=1-85960-874-4 | year=2002 | publisher=Haynes North America | location=Newbury Park, Calif. }}</ref>

The second largest market is now the USA. In 2008, three different Minis (a Clubman, the hatchback, and an Mk I convertible) were offered in the pricing game [[1 Wrong Price]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' after the show removed the Barker-era "[[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big Three]] Only" rule.

In 2008 the green version of the Mini, the Mini Cooper D, was nominated for [http://www.whatgreencar.com WhatGreenCar.com] Car of the Year Awards.  The judges highly commended the Cooper D for its EfficientDynamics stop-start and regenerative braking technology and were hugely impressed by the driving experience offered by the car.  It reached the shortlist for the [[Green Car Awards]], but eventually lost out to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus_(International)#Focus_ECOnetic Ford Focus ECOnetic].

==Racing==
A new racing version of the Mini based on the R56 Cooper S, called the ''Mini John Cooper Works CHALLENGE'', has been built, and was raced in the 2008 Mini Challenge.<ref>[http://www.minichallenge.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=106&Itemid=9 More Information]</ref> [[RSR Motorsports]] has entered three Mini Coopers in the [[KONI Challenge Series]] Street Tuner class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grand-am.com/schedule/entrylist.cfm?series=k&eid=877 |title=Event Information - Entry List |publisher=Grand-am.com |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref>
