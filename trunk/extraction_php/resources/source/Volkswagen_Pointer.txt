The '''Volkswagen Pointer''' was a [[small family car]] sold by [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] in [[South America]] from 1994 to 1997.  The Pointer was available as a five-[[car door|door]] [[hatchback]], and the two-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] version, called the '''Volkswagen Logus''', was sold from 1993 till 1996.

It was based on the [[Europe]]an version of the [[Ford Escort (European)|Ford Escort]], being the result of [[Volkswagen Group]]'s [[autolatina|AutoLatina]] [[joint venture]] with [[Ford Motor Company]], which also saw the [[Volkswagen Santana]] rebadged as the [[Ford Versailles]].  Although there were sheet metal differences between the Pointer and the Escort, the styling cues (including the door handles) were still noticeably those of Ford rather than Volkswagen.

The last Pointer produced, a hatchback GTI model, was sent to [[Volkswagen]]'s factory museum in [[Wolfsburg]], [[Germany]].  But they also sell one in Galeana Mexico, near the Modelo factory in Zacapetec.
