The '''Smart Fortwo''' is a rear-engined two-seater car manufactured by [[Smart (automobile)|Smart GmbH]] and introduced at the 1998 [[Paris Motor Show]]. Initially named the Smart '''City Coupe''', the '''fortwo''' has now entered its second generation, and in 2008, an all electric concept version of the model, the '''fortwo ed,''' debuted.

==Features==
===Transmission and shifting performance===
The smart features an [[Semi-automatic transmission|automated manual transmission]] without a clutch pedal, 6-speed for the first generation, 5-speed for the second. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode, though the shift points are not as smooth as in a traditional [[automatic transmission]]. In paddle shifter mode, the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch. Thus some skill, and a slight lifting of the accelerator pedal, is required to achieve a smooth shift.

In 2009 the dealers have retro installed a software change that allows for seamless shifting. One no longer needs to lift the accelerator to change gears. This change has contributed to much smoother shifting.[citation needed]

===Parking===
[[Image:smart parking.JPG|250px|right|thumb|An example of smart fortwo compact parking]]
The smart car allows back-in parking in otherwise parallel parking zones; its length of 250&nbsp;cm (98.4&nbsp;in) equals the width of a truck or a regular parking slot, allowing two or three Smarts to park in a standard space reserved for a single car. However, this type of parking has been banned in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], amongst other places. Such parking in parallel-designated spaces is illegal in most U.S.A jurisdictions. {{Citation needed|date|date=June 2008}} Current model is 269 cm (106.1 Inches).

===Identity and registration===
The smart features interchangeable body panels—whereby one car can easily assume a different look. To accommodate a licensing agent's notation of a vehicle's color, the '''fortwo''' is sometimes registered as 'silver' or 'black' based on the Tridion frame color, which remains constant regardless of the body panels.

}}

====Engine and fuel economy====
The engine ranges featured [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[straight-3|three cylinder]] motors. Originally, the base petrol engine had 599&nbsp;cc, but displacement increased to 698&nbsp;cc with an early restyling. It was available in 37&nbsp;[[Watt|kW]] (50&nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]]) or 45&nbsp;kW (61&nbsp;hp) variants. The turbodiesel engine has 799&nbsp;cc displacement with 30&nbsp;kW (40&nbsp;hp). Engines are mounted in the rear of the vehicle.

===Models===
The fortwo is available with targa-style removable roof panels (originally city cabrio, now fortwo cabrio), introduced in 2000, and was restyled in 2002. Model variants include the base model Pure, sporty mid-spec model Pulse coupe, and luxury top-spec model Passion Cabriolet.

====Special editions and concepts====
* '''Limited 1''': The first limited edition of which 7500 were made. All left hand drive. Released at the time of the original launch in 1998. Black Tridion cell and White body panals. Alloy wheels, Limited 1 insignia, Blue interior with Beige Leather finishings. Supplied with certificate showing which number out of the 7500 made. A plaque with this number was mounted just below the windshield on the inside.
* '''Cdi''': has the world's smallest production car [[diesel engine]], which uses [[common rail|common-rail direct injection]]. With a consumption of 3.3 litres ([[NEDC]]) per 100 kilometres and [[carbon dioxide|CO2]] emissions of just 88 grams per kilometre, it has the lowest current production car [[carbon dioxide|CO2]] emissions worldwide, since [[Audi|Audi's]] and [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen's]] retired "3 litre" cars, the [[Audi A2#1.2 TDI|A2 1.2 TDI]] and the [[Volkswagen Lupo#Lupo 3L|Lupo 1.2 TDI]] respectively.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-smart-fortwo-micro-hybrid-launches/ Frankfurt 2007: Smart ForTwo micro hybrid launches! - AutoblogGreen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* '''Crossblade''': a 2002 limited-edition variant of the city cabrio, a roadster without a windshield, roof or conventional doors, limiting its use. Its weight was still {{convert|740|kg}}. The [[Brabus]]-tuned engine developed 52&nbsp;kW (71&nbsp;PS) from its 599&nbsp;cc engine. After [[Robbie Williams]] purchased Crossblade number 008, smart began a marketing association with the British singer, using Williams to promote the brand and the new ForFour.
* '''[[Smart Crosstown|Crosstown]]''': a convertible with a foldable windshield based on the fortwo, was presented at IAA Frankfurt in 2005. No plans have yet been announced to bring this model to market.
* '''[[Michalak C7]]''': a sports car using mostly ForTwo parts.
* '''Nightrun''': includes instrument panels, steering wheel, paddles, shifter, Monoblock VI alloy wheels, leather seats and engine upgrade from Brabus. Edition Nightrun is only available with the fortwo coupé.
* '''Truestyle''': painted in metallic paint colour, ruby red, available in pure trim.
* '''i-move''': a special edition run of 70 fortwo cabrios, based on the passion cabrio specs with Brabus Monobloc VI wheels, Leather interior trim, and Lite White Panels. The Addition of an iPod cradle which held a special edition 20Gb G3 iPod, and an aluminium name plate on the dash confirmed its special edition status.
* '''Forfun2 Concept''': an off-road version of the fortwo introduced at the 2005 Athens Motor Show by Greek 4x4 Rally Champion Stefan Attart. The forfun 2 Concept combines the body of a fortwo with the chassis and drivetrain of a [[Unimog]]. It sports monster truck-like 26-inch wheels wrapped in 140&nbsp;cm diameter tires and winding keys where the fortwo's rear wheels are supposed to be.<ref>[http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2006-Smart-Forfun2-Concept.htm Smart forfun2: The combination of two vehicles with cult status]</ref>
* '''Brabus''': In the 2007 Geneva Motor Show, Smart introduced the Brabus version of the Smart Fortwo, It has {{convert|98|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} of power and 0 to {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} takes 9.9 seconds with top speed electrically limited at {{convert|155|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}

Introduced [[November 10]], [[2006]], the second generation features slightly greater length and improved crash performance while maintaining similar styling.

===Engine and fuel economy===
The new 999 cc version [[Mitsubishi 3B2 engine|3B21]] (2007 onwards) is produced by [[Mitsubishi Motors]] and it comprises normally aspirated (NA) and turbo versions. The NA 999 cc engine has 11.4:1 compression ratio and premium fuel (95+ RON) is recommended. It is rated at {{convert|71|hp|abbr=on}}. The US NA 999 cc engine has a 10:1 compression ratio and premium fuel (91 Octane) is recommended. German tuner company Brabus, in a joint venture with Smart, has developed a version with 72&nbsp;kW (98&nbsp;hp) and 140&nbsp;N·m torque, available in Europe only at this time.

[[European Union]] (EU) testing rates the 999 cc Smart at {{convert|4.7|L/100 km|abbr=on|lk=on}} for the gasoline model and {{convert|3.4|L/100 km|abbr=on}} for the diesel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The [[Fuel economy in automobiles#New 2008- EPA testing procedure|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) rates the vehicle at {{convert|36|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} combined.<ref>[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/26294.shtml 2009 smart fortwo coupe ] Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved March 10, 2009.</ref>

===Concept===
The smart fortwo's length is {{convert|8|ft|10|in|m|2|abbr=on}} (second generation).

An exposed, rigid steel frame, marketed as the "Tridion" frame, surrounds and protects the passenger compartment while defining the car's shape and design&mdash;and allowing for interchangeable plastic body panels to complete the exterior. With a weight of {{convert|730|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, it is one of the lightest cars in the European market.

===Safety===
The Smart is equipped with seat-mounted combination [[airbag|side airbags]] as well as [[electronic stability control]]. To maximize the front [[crumple zone]], the smart fortwo's engine is rear-mounted.

In [[IIHS|Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] tests, the 2008 Smart Fortwo, the smallest car marketed in the US market, earned the top overall rating of "Good" in both the front and side crash tests. The Fortwo received the "Good" score in 8 of 11 measured injury categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=632 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Smart Fortwo |publisher=Iihs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref> Its seat/head restraints earned the second highest rating of "Acceptable" for protection against whiplash in rear impacts.  The IIHS did an offset [[crash test]] with a Smart Fortwo and [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class]], which is 40% of one car's driver's side head on with 40% of another car's driver's side, and the Smart received a "Poor" rating due to the occupants heads slamming into the steering wheel.  Also, there was too much intrusion into the footwell of the Smart Fortwo.  Dummy movement was not well controlled.  The Smart Fortwo circled 540 degrees and landed approximately {{convert|45|ft|m}} away from the initial crash.

===Hybrid===
At the 2007 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], Smart launched the a "micro hybrid drive" version of the ForTwo, a [[mild hybrid]]. Smart claimed this provides a fuel efficiency improvement of eight percent from {{convert|50|mpgus|lk=off }} to almost {{convert|55|mpgus|lk=off }}, while [[Carbon dioxide emission]]s drop from 112 to 103g/km.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The mhd version of the fortwo is not currently available in the USA or Canada.

==International markets==
===Australia===
The Smart fortwo is available in [[Australia]] since 2003 in only the middle 'Pulse' range, and with the gasoline engine. As of [[April 16]], [[2007]] the base price for the fortwo coupé is [[AU$]]19,900, and for the fortwo cabriolet is $22,900. The Smart fortwo is sold through selected [[Mercedes-Benz]] dealers.

===Canada===
The Smart fortwo was introduced in [[Canada]] in 2004 and sold through Mercedes-Benz dealers. Only the turbo-diesel powerplant was offered for the coupé and convertible models because of tough emission regulations for gasoline engines dictated by Transport Canada. Demand was initially heavy, with up to six-month waiting lists in major urban areas in the spring of 2005. The vehicle has proven especially popular for light errand running for small shops and businesses, with many carrying custom paint jobs or stick-on graphics boldly advertising the associated product or service.

In 2008, Canada only received the gasoline model because the diesel version does not meet 2007 emission standards. The fortwo carries a 1.0-litre engine that delivers up to {{convert|70|hp}} and a re-engineered automated-manual 5-speed transmission with a slightly larger body. It is not yet decided if any other engines will be offered by smart Canada in the future such as the micro hybrid or a future diesel model. At this point the 2009 model of the smart will continue to have the {{convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} gasoline powered engine. Despite the changes, the fortwo still sells well in Canada, with some dealers saying they once again have waiting lists of people looking for the cars.

===China===
[[Image:smart vending machine in Shenyang.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Smart "[[vending machine]]" in [[Shenyang]], [[China]]]]

In April 2008, Smart first premiered in the [[China Auto Show]] 2008 in [[Beijing]]. On October 1, 2008, the Smart "[[vending machine]]" road show had the first stop in [[Shenyang]] (at [[Isetan]]), and also started the pre-order period. The cost for reserving a Smart was 388 [[RMB]].<ref>[https://reservet.china.smart.com/smart/RegistrationFirstStep.do?model=4&exterior_color=3&safty_color=1&interior_color=4&visitor_code=74DEWD3LH-18I5F&visitor_grade=5&visitor_language=CN Smart online reservation]</ref> The price range of smart fortwo in China is 168,000 to 216,000 RMB.

===Japan===
There is a Japan-only variant called the Smart K which is the only non-Japanese car that fulfills the regulations for [[Kei car]]s.

===United States===
====Modified imports====
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
[[Image:Smart-ForTwo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Smart Fortwo in the United States]]
In early 2006, a specialty automotive import and engineering firm - G and K Auto conversions (GNKAuto.com) of Santa Ana California - after investing millions of dollars in testing and fees, received DOT, NHTSA, and EPA approval to sell a modified European specification Smart Fortwo in the US. The 23 modifications to the Smart Fortwo included DOT certified headlights, reinforced doors for additional side impact protection, an odometer that reads in miles rather than kilometers, and soft padding on the interior pillars and ceiling. Smart Fortwo dealers in the US were a mix of "green car" specialty companies (GreenCarCo.com), (EcoAutoInc.com) and exotic car dealers. Approximately 1,000 model year 2004, 2005, and 2006 Smart cars were imported without Smart's or Mercedes Benz's cooperation and converted by G&K.

====Made for US market====

On 26 June, 2002, Smart fortwo was exhibited at the new [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) affiliate [[P.S. 1]] in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]] for the first time.

In September 2006, [[Daimler AG]] announced that Smart USA, a division of [[Penske|Penske Auto Group]] (at the time of the announcement it was United Auto Group, later changed to PAG,<ref>BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MI (April 2, 2007) – smart USA, a subsidiary of United Auto Group, Inc, (NYSE:UAG), has launched its smart fortwo reservation system. The smart fortwo is expected to go on sale in the United States in the first quarter 2008 through a dealership network being developed by smart USA, the exclusive distributor of the smart fortwo in the United States and Puerto Rico. </ref> ) would be the official distributor for Smart in the United States and Puerto Rico.

The redesigned smart fortwo (Model 451) has been available since January 2008 in the USA. Numerous changes were made from the previous model (450). Its Mercedes Benz power plant was replaced by a non-turbo [[Mitsubishi 3B21]] engine and the overall dimensions of the car increased.

The 2009 model year US version of the smart fortwo is available in 3 trims: Pure (base trim), Passion, and Passion cabriolet. Pure has an MSRP of [[United States dollar|US$]]11,990, Passion has an MSRP of $13,990, and the Passion Cabriolet has an MSRP $16,990.<ref>[http://www.automotive.com/2009/12/smart/fortwo/pricing/index.html 2009 Smart fortwo]</ref>  A reservation program was launched by Smart USA in March, 2007.<ref>[http://www.smartusa.com SmartUSA website]</ref><ref>[http://www.egmcartech.com/2007/02/05/reserve-your-smart-fortwo-for-99/ Reserve your Smart forTwo for $99]</ref> This program allowed interested parties to place a $99 refundable deposit on the new fortwo in preparation for the product's launch.
