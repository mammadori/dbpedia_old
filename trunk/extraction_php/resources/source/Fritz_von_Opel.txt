'''Fritz Adam Hermann Opel''', since 1918 '''von Opel''' ([[May 4]] [[1899]] - [[April 8]] [[1971]]), was the only child of [[Wilhelm von Opel]], and a grandson of [[Adam Opel]], founder of the [[Opel]] Company. He is remembered mostly for his spectacular demonstrations of [[rocket]] propulsion that earned him the [[nickname]] "Rocket Fritz".

Von Opel was born in [[Rüsselsheim]] and educated at the technical university of [[Darmstadt]]. After graduation, he was made director of testing for Opel and also put in charge of publicity. In the 1920s, he became interested in using rockets in [[publicity stunt]]s for the company and sought advice from [[Max Valier]] of the newly-formed ''[[Verein für Raumschiffahrt]]'' (VfR - "Spaceflight Society") and [[Friedrich Sander]], a [[pyrotechnics]] manufacturer from [[Bremerhaven]]. 

On [[March 15]] [[1928]], von Opel tested his first rocket-powered car, the [[Opel_RAK.1_(car)|RAK.1]] and achieved a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph) in it, proving the concept. Less than two months later, he reached a speed of 230 km/h (143 mph) in the [[Opel RAK.2|RAK.2]], driven by 24 solid-fuel rockets. 

Later that same year, he purchased a [[sailplane]] named the "[[Lippisch Ente|Ente]]" (''duck'' in German) from [[Alexander Lippisch]] and attached rocket motors to it, creating the world's first rocket plane on [[June 11]]. The aircraft exploded on its second test flight, before von Opel had a chance to pilot it himself, so he commissioned a new aircraft, also called the [[Opel RAK.1|RAK.1]] from [[Julius Hatry]], and flew it at [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] on [[September 30]] [[1929]]. In the meantime, another mishap had claimed the [[Opel RAK.3|RAK.3]], a rocket-powered railway car powered by 30 solid-fuel rockets and which reached a speed of 254 km/h (157 mph).

Von Opel left the Opel company and Germany after 1929 and died in [[Samedan]], [[Switzerland]].

Fritz von Opel is the father of [[Formula One]] driver [[Rikky von Opel]].
