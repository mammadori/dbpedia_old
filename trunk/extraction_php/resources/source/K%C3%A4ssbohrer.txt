'''Kässbohrer Fahrzeugwerke''' was a German vehicle manufacturer in [[Ulm]]. Its products were [[bus]]es, [[Coach (vehicle)|coaches]], [[vehicle transporter]]s, [[trailer]]s and special vehicles like [[Snow grooming|snow groomer vehicles]]. 

In 1893 Karl Kässbohrer founded the ''Wagenfabrik Kässbohrer'' in Ulm. In 1922 Kässbohrer developed a trailer for goods transport, having solid rubber wheels. When Karl Kässbohrer senior died, his sons, Karl junior and Otto Kässbohrer took over the company. In 1969, Kässbohrer was Germany's biggest coach and truck trailer producer. Kässbohrer's coaches and buses were named [[Setra]]. The snow grooming vehicles were called ''PistenBully'' and 2,000 were sold between 1979 and 1989. At the end of the 1990s about 9,000 employees worked for Kässbohrer.

Starting in 1993, the company began to fall apart. The division's truck bodies, semi-trailers and trailers were sold to the competitor [[Kögel]]. In 1994 the snow groomer vehicles division was spun off to Kässbohrer Geländefahrzeug (all-terrain vehicle) GmbH, based in [[Laupheim]], which also produces [[beach cleaner]]s. In the end, Mercedes-Benz bought the bus and coach division in 1995 and the new name [[EvoBus]] was introduced. The only division which is still family owned, is ''Kässbohrer Transport Technik'' in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], where vehicle transporters are built.

A remarkable number of Kässbohrer Setra coaches and buses are still in service on German roads, sometimes having a mileage of more than a million kilometers.
