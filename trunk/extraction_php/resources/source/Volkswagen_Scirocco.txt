The '''Scirocco''' is a [[sports coupe]] manufactured by German manufacturer [[Volkswagen]] (VW), undergoing two generations of development between 1974 and 1992 and reintroduced in a third generation in August, 2008.

The  Scirocco name derives from the Italian<!--in German:Schirokko--> word for the [[Sirocco]] wind &mdash; and the period in its history when Volkswagen named vehicles after prominent winds, including also Passat (after the German word for [[Trade wind]]), Golf (after [[Gulf Stream]]), Bora (after [[Bora (wind)|Bora]]) and Jetta (after [[Jet stream]]).

Volkswagen began work on the car during the early 1970s as the replacement for the aging [[Karmann Ghia]] coupe, and designated it the '''Type 53''' internally.  The platform of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf/Rabbit]] and [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] was used to underpin the new Scirocco, although almost every part of the car was re-engineered in favour of a sportier drive, and the model's all-new styling, penned by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]], was sleeker and sportier than that of either the Golf or Jetta.  Launched six months before the Golf, in order to resolve any teething troubles before production of the high volume hatchback started,<ref>[http://sciroccoregisterforum.co.uk/index.php?p=1_5_Scirocco-Timeline Scirocco Timeline]</ref> the Scirocco went on sale in [[Europe]] in 1974 and in [[North America]] in 1975.  Mark I models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6&nbsp;L (1.7&nbsp;L in North America (1975 1.5L(1471), 1976-77 1.6L, 1978 1.5L(1457), 1979-1981 1.6 USA models), all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.

The car changed little before being replaced by the Mark 2 version in 1982 (Europe).   However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite journal| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Tecknik: Klimaanlage fuer VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 18 1975| pages = Seite 36 |date = date 30 August 1975}}</ref>  The possibility to retrofit the installation, together with a larger battery, was offered to existing owners.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975/>

During the production of the Mark I, there were subtle changes to the body and trim.  In 1977 (1976 was first year) the conventional two wiper system changes to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen.  In 1978 the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens.  Other mid-life changes include chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic one-piece wrap around bumper.  In 1979 the one-pieces "flag" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  There were also special variants throughout the Mark I production.  Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called "Sidewinder", "Sidewinder II", "Champagne Edition", "Champagne Edition II" and the "S".  The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents. On the NA models the 1980 "S" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This was followed by the 1981 "S" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents.

The Scirocco Mark I was featured in the original 1978 version of [[George Romero|George Romero's]] [[Dawn of the Dead (1978)|Dawn of the Dead]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_21874-Volkswagen-Scirocco-Typ-53-1978.html |title=1978 Volkswagen Scirocco MkI [Typ 53&#93; in "Dawn of the Dead, 1978" |publisher=IMCDb.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref>

A heavily re-designed "Mark II" variant went on sale in 1982, although it remained on the A1 platform.  One unique feature of the Mark II was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch.  A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model:  removal of the outlined "SCIROCCO" script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.  Half way through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second "transfer" fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years.  Engine power and torque steadily increased over the years. 1982 and 1983 models produced {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produced {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} torque, the engine code was JH.  In mid-1986 a 16-valve model with {{convert|123|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|120|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots, and vinyl on the B-pillar, to distinguish it from Mark II 8-valve models. The 16V engine code was PL.

Although the 16-valve engine brought added performance to the range, it proved a somewhat questionable choice in the North American market, as later A2 Golf GTIs manufacturered in the USA were available with a more powerful 16-valve 2.0&nbsp;L motor. This was, however, not questionable at the time since the 2.0&nbsp;L 16V engine did not show up in North America until 1990, two years after the demise of the Scirocco. Still, the European 1.8 16V that was fitted into the Scirocco GTX 16V model developed {{convert|139|bhp|abbr=on}}, surpassed only by the A3 generation 2.0 16v with {{convert|150|bhp|abbr=on}}.

Like the first generation Scirocco, the car was assembled on behalf of Volkswagen by [[Karmann]] of [[Osnabrück]].

Scirocco sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in [[Canada]], and 1992 in Europe.

The Scirocco was replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up.

The direct competitors, two [[Opel Astra]] GTC driven by drivers selected from 18,000 hopefuls in a year-long TV covered process, were beaten decisively.
