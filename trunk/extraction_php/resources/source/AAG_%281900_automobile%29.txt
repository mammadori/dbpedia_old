{{Unreferenced|date=July 2009}}'''AAG''' was the brand name of a [[Germany|German]] [[automobile]] company which offered only one car, a 5 [[horsepower|hp]] (4 kW) [[voiturette]] designed by one Professor Klingenberg and manufactured between 1900 and 1901.  The company factory was bought by the politician [[Emil Rathenau]], also the head of the [[AEG Group]].  He renamed it to the [[Neue Automobil Gesellschaft]] (NAG for short), and the company produced cars until 1934.
