The '''Porsche 993''' is the compan y's internal name for the version of the [[Porsche 911]] model manufactured and sold between late 1993 and early 1998, replacing the [[Porsche 964|964]]. Its discontinuation marked the end of [[air-cooled]] Porsches.  

Like previous and future generations of the Porsche 911, there were several variants of the car manufactured, varying in body style, drivetrains, and included equipment. The Porsche 993 was replaced by the [[Porsche 996]].

Citing cost reasons the designer of the Porsche 993 used the doors of the Porsche 964 in the design of the Porsche 993; along with the [[flat-6]] engines (and gearbox in 2wd variants) these are reported to be only major components carried over. 

==Overview==
===Technical improvements===
One of the changes in the 993 over preceding 911s is the implementation of an all-[[alloy]] multi-arm rear [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] attached to an all-alloy subframe. Its design was derived from the project [[Porsche 989|989]], a four-door sedan which never went into production, and was later continued in the 993's successor, type [[Porsche 996|996]]. It required the aforementioned widening of the rear wheel arches, which itself helped the 993's stability. This suspension improved the 993's cornering abilities, making it more direct and more stable and helping to reduce the tendency to oversteer if throttle was lifted during hard cornering, a trait of earlier 911s. It also reduced interior noise and improved ride quality.

The 993 was the first generation of 911 to have a standard six-speed [[manual transmission]]; previous cars, except for the [[Porsche 959]], had 4- or 5-speed gearboxes. In virtually every situation, it was possible to keep the engine in its best torque range above 4500 rpm. The Carrera / Carrera S / Cabriolet and Targa models (2WD) were available with a "[[Tiptronic]]" 4-speed [[automatic transmission]], first introduced in the [[Porsche 964|964]]. Beginning with [[model year]] 1995, Porsche offered the Tiptronic S with additional steering wheel mounted controls and refined software for smoother, quicker shifts. Since the 993's introduction, the Tiptronic is capable of recognizing climbs and descents.

Further, the 993's optional [[all wheel drive]] system was refined over that of the 964. Porsche departed from the 964's setup consisting of three differentials and revised the system based on the layout from its [[Porsche 959|959]] supercar, replacing the centre differential with a [[viscous coupling]] unit. In conjunction with the 993's redesigned and recalibrated suspension, this system improved handling characteristics and still retained the stability offered by AWD without having to suffer compromises in understeer. Its simpler layout also reduced the system's weight.

Other improvements include a new dual-flow [[exhaust system|exhaust]], larger [[brake]]s with drilled discs, and revised [[power steering]].

==993 Variants==
===Carrera Coupe / Cabriolet===
The [[Porsche Carrera|Carrera]] represented the "base model" of the 993, and was available in [[rear wheel drive|rear]] and all-wheel drive versions. It was equipped with the naturally aspirated 3.6 liter M64 engine, further developed from the [[Porsche 964|964]] and combined with a new dual-flow exhaust system now incorporating two [[catalytic converter]]s. In contrast to the Type [[Porsche 964|964]], Porsche deleted the "2" from the rear-wheel drive "Carrera" name tag. However among enthusiasts, to differentiate between the rear-wheel and all-wheel drive variants of the Type 993 Carrera they were (and still are) commonly referred to as "C2" and "C4", respectively.

The options list for the 993 Carrera (and most other variants) was extensive and offered the possibility to easily configure highly individualized cars, depending on the amount of money a buyer was willing to spend. Options included up to five different styles of wheels, various [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] set-ups, at least three different seat styles (comfort, sport, racing), uncountable upholstery options including the possibility to have almost any interior element of the car covered with leather, wood or carbon fiber, and various hi-fi systems including digital sound processing. Further, Porsche offered the option to a customer to have their car painted in any color that they may desire if the standard palette wasn't satisfactory. Even more, the Tequipment- and Exclusive-Programs added further options and built to order almost any specific wishes of customers such as special consoles, fax-machines or even brightly colored interior upholstery.

The Cabriolet, introduced 1995, features a fully electrical and hand-stitched softtop reinforced with [[metal sheet]]s and an automatic windblocker.

Both [[coupe]] and [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] versions were available with [[all-wheel drive]] under the tag 'Carrera 4'. From the outside the Carrera 4 is distinguishable by clear front turn markers and rear red markers (each instead of orange). The brake calipers are painted silver as is the 'Carrera 4' badge on the hood. The center wheelcaps carry the Carrera 4 logo instead of the Porsche crest.

In contrast to most of the following other variants, production of the Carrera Coupe and Cabriolet ceased with the end of [[model year]] 1997, except for a very few produced in a shortened 1998 model year.

===Targa===
The Targa version of the 993 was introduced in [[model year]] 1996 and saw the debut of a retractable [[sunroof|glass roof]], a design continued on the 996 and 997 Targa. The glass roof would retract underneath the rear window revealing a large opening. A shade was there to help prevent the [[greenhouse effect]] of the closed roof. This system was a complete redesign, as previous Targa models had a removable roof section and a wide [[B-pillar]] functioning as a [[roll bar]]. The new glass roof design allowed the 993 Targa to retain the same side-on profile as the other 911 Carrera variants and finished with the inconvenience of storing the removed top of the old system. The Targa has the [[bodywork|body]] of the [[convertible]] with the Targa glass roof replacing the fabric roof.

The Targa was equipped with distinctive 2-piece {{convert|17|in|mm|sing=on}} wheels, which could be ordered as an option on all cars not having standard {{convert|18|in|mm|sing=on}} wheels. Problems with the Targa include heat in the cabin, creaking noises on rough roads and a very complicated and unreliable mechanism.

===Turbo===
[[Image:993 TT in Westend Frankfurt.JPG|200px|thumb|right|993 TT in Westend Frankfurt]]
The 993 Turbo coupe was released in 1995. It featured a new [[turbocharged]] engine displacing 3.6 liters.  Twin [[turbocharger]]s and air-to-air [[intercooler]]s, electronic engine management, redesigned [[cylinder head]]s and other modified engine internals were used. The 993 Turbo was the first Porsche Turbo with [[all wheel drive]]. The electronic engine management helped the Turbo to achieve fuel efficiency far superior to any of the previous production Turbos{{Fact|date=March 2009}}. In connection with two catalytic converters and an on-board-diagnostics-system including four oxygen-sensors, it also made the 993 Turbo the cleanest sports car at its time{{Fact|date=March 2009}}. The Turbo's [[bodywork]] differs from the Carrera body by widened rear wheel arches (approximately 6&nbsp;cm), redesigned front and rear bumper moldings, and a fixed rear wing housing the intercoolers. New {{convert|18|in|mm|sing=on}} [[alloy]] wheels with weight-reducing hollow spokes were standard.

This was one of the first production cars in the world to have [[On-board diagnostics|OBDII diagnostics]]{{Fact|date=March 2009}} (the normally aspirated 993s didn't have it, nor did the 3.8 liter and track versions). The 993 turbo was the fastest production car in the world when it was produced{{Fact|date=March 2009}}.  All turbos since have had water cooled heads. The car also had [[brake]]s that were larger than those on the base Carrera model. The 993 Turbo model was the fastest stopping car in production at the time and was tested going 0-60mph in 3.8 seconds, and stopping from {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} to 0 in 2.3 seconds{{Fact|date=March 2009}}.

{{Unreferenced|date=March 2009}}
Within the 1996 through 1998 production run, there were two distinct differences - the 1996 and the later ones. The 1997s and 1998s had the following differences from the 1996s:
1 - Stronger [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] input shafts (a known weakness due to the combination of immense power and AWD).
2 - An ECU that was able to be flashed and modified (the 1996 was not modifiable).
3 - With the addition of a Porsche child seat, the passenger [[airbag]] was cutoff, thereby fostering a new generation of enthusiasts.
4 - Motion [[sensor]]s for the alarm that were integrated into the map light above the [[rear view mirror]].
5 - Standard wheel center caps that said "turbo" (the 1996 version had Porsche crests).

===Turbo S===
During the second to the last year of production of the 993 (1997), Porsche offered the 993 Turbo S. Ultimately 183 cars were sold. The Turbo S is a high-spec Turbo including a power upgrade to 424 [[Horsepower|hp (SAE)]] for the [[United States|American]] market and to 450 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]] in other markets. The inclusion of extras including carbonfibre decoration in the interior makes it different from the earlier lightweight, spartan 964 Turbo S. The 993 Turbo S is recognized by yellow brake calipers, a slightly larger rear wing, a 4-pipe exhaust and air scoops behind the doors.  This was the last of the [[air-cooled]] Turbos.  12 Turbo S cars were delivered to [[Australia]].

Most critics today call it "the best porsche ever made" and that "it will never be defeated."

It was based on the GT2 but with 4WD and it was a bit more luxurious. It has the same brakes as the GT2 and same basic shape as the GT2.

===Carrera 4S / Carrera S===
The Carrera 4 S (1996) and later Carrera S (1997) shared the Turbo model's [[bodywork|bodyshell]], but housed the [[Naturally-aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] Carrera engine in the rear. The 4S came with four wheel drive, and retained the Turbo model's larger [[brake]] discs with the characteristic red callipers.  It could be described as a "Turbo without the turbochargers and rear wing", whereas the S was in all aspects a standard Carrera underneath (the wider rear fenders were compensated with {{convert|31|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheel spacers). Both S models had slightly lowered [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] compared to standard Carrera models. The wide body is widely acclaimed for its rear looks, but creates more [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] drag, leading to slightly lower top speeds compared to the narrower siblings (about 5&nbsp;km/h).

===Carrera RS===
[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera RS 993 2.7 (Orange Julep).jpg|thumb|left|Porsche 911 (993) Carrera RS 2.7]]
The Carrera RS is a [[lightweight]] variant of the Carrera. It features a naturally aspirated 3.8 liter engine with 300 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]]. On the outside, it is easily distinguishable by a special non-retractable rear wing, small front flaps and 3-piece {{convert|18|in|mm|sing=on}} [[aluminum]] wheels. The [[headlight]] washers were deleted for weight saving reasons. Inside the rear seats were removed, and special racing seats and spartan door cards were installed. [[Sound proof]]ing was reduced to a minimum.

There are further RS variants, in particular a track-oriented Carrera RS Clubsport with only limited road usability. The Clubsport has a welded roll cage, and certain comfort features removed, such as carpets, [[power window]]s, a/c and radio. It carries a larger rear wing and deeper chin spoiler.

The Carrera RS was produced in model year 1995 and 1996. It was street legal in [[Europe]]an and many other countries, but was not exported to the [[United States|US]]. As with the low-quantity RS variants of previous 911 types, owners sometimes attempt to turn their Carreras into RS clones due to the high market value of the RS{{Fact|date=March 2009}}.

===GT2===
[[Image:Porsche 993 GT2.jpg|right|250px|Porsche 993 GT2]]

The [[Porsche 911 GT2#993 generation|GT2]] is the racing version of the [[Porsche 993#Turbo|Turbo]]. For weight saving reasons and also because most racing regulations don't allow it, the 4WD was deleted{{Fact|date=March 2009}}. The interior is similar to the Carrera RS. The fenders of the Turbo have been cut and replaced with bolt-on plastic pieces in order to accommodate large racing tires and to ease the repair of damages to the fenders often occurring in racing.

Until 1997, the GT2 had almost the same engine as the Turbo, but delivering 430 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]]. In model year 1998 output was raised to 450 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]] and twin [[ignition]] was added.

The many racing variants have different engine set-ups depending on the applicable racing series. Power output came as high as {{convert|600|bhp|abbr=on}} in a "Evo" version designed for the GT1-series, which was ultimately replaced by the [[mid-engine]] 911 GT1.

Additionally, the rear deck lid of an original GT2 will also sport "911 GT" instead of "911 GT2".

===Speedster===
The Speedster model, was a variant of the 993, with a lowered roof, and a redesigned interior.

In contrast to the G-model and the 964, Porsche never officially released a 993 Speedster. However, two were built by the factory: a dark green Speedster equipped with [[Tiptronic]] S and {{convert|17|in|mm|sing=on}} wheels for [[Ferdinand Alexander Porsche]] (for his 60th anniversary) in 1995 and another wide-body, silver Speedster with [[manual transmission]] and {{convert|18|in|mm|sing=on}} wheels for American TV star [[Jerry Seinfeld]] in 1998.

===Turbo Cabriolet===
After the 3.3 liter G-model Turbo [[convertible]] (1987-89), Porsche never officially offered an [[air-cooled]] Turbo convertible again. However, in 1995 14,993 Turbo Cabriolets were sold before the introduction of the 993 Turbo coupe. They featured the 360 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]] single-turbo engine of the 964 Turbo 3.6, a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] and the wing of the 964 Turbo 3.6. This required a premium of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 89,500 (or plus 62%) over the standard 993 Cabriolet's price.

==Engines==
The 993 is powered by the [[air-cooled]] Porsche [[flat-6|flat-six]]. Porsche had begun employing this engine in the [[Porsche 901]] in 1963 at 2 liters capacity with 130 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]] output.

Any engine in any 993 variant is a derivative of the M64. The standard, [[naturally aspirated]] M64/05(06) engine at 3.6 liters capacity is a refined version of the M64/01 installed in the 964 Carrera. At first, the M64/05(06) made 272 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]] through 1996, before Porsche switched to the [[VarioRam]]-equipped M64/21(22) engine, and power output increased to 285 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]]. Slightly more powerful versions with 3.8 liter were available in the Carrera RS and as build-to-order options throughout the 993's lifespan.

The 3.6 liter twin turbo M64/60 engine uses two KKK K16 turbos and produces 408 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]], although more powerful versions (430 and 450 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]]) were available as build-to-order options, in the Turbo S, and in the GT2. Depending on the country, Porsche still offers 430 and 450 [[Horsepower|hp (DIN)]] kits for the Turbo.
