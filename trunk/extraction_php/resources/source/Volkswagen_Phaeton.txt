The '''Volkswagen Phaeton''' (pronounced "fay-ton") is a [[full-size]] [[luxury car|luxury]] [[sedan (automobile)|sedan/saloon]] manufactured by [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Passenger Cars]], and is described by Volkswagen as their "premium class".<ref>[http://www.glaesernemanufaktur.de/gmd.jsp?dok=&lang=en&docid=&ap= GlaeserneManufaktur.de]</ref>  Introduced at the 2002 [[Geneva Motor Show]], and marketed worldwide, the Phaeton has been sold in Europe and Middle East markets from model year 2003 to present, South Korea from model year 2006 to present, and was sold in [[North America]] from [[model year]] 2004 through 2006.

The name Phaeton derives from [[Phaëton]], the son of [[Phoebus]] (or [[Helios]]) in  [[Greek mythology]].

==Overview==
[[File:VW Phaeton rear 20071215.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Rear-view of a VW Phaeton]]
The Phaeton was conceived by [[Ferdinand Piëch]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, the then chairman of [[Volkswagen Group]].  Piëch wanted Volkswagen engineers to create a car that would overwhelmingly surpass the German prestige market leaders, [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]].  The decision to release the Phaeton was, in part, a response to Mercedes's decision to compete directly with Volkswagen in the [[Europe]]an marketplace with the low-cost [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class|A-Class]].  It was also intended to support the Volkswagen brand image, since the most expensive versions of lesser models, such as the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf GTI]], were starting to cost almost as much as equivalently-sized prestige brands.

Initial development of the Phaeton, given the internal project code VW611, began with Piëch giving his engineers a list of ten parameters the car needed to fulfill.  Most of these specifications were not made known to the public, but a number of them were told to automotive reporters.  One of them was that the Phaeton should be capable of being driven all day at {{convert|300|km/h|0|lk=off}} with an exterior temperature of {{convert|50|°C|0|lk=on}} whilst maintaining the interior temperature at {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}}.  Piëch requested this even though the Phaeton's top speed was electronically limited to {{convert|250|km/h|1|lk=on}}.<ref>''Top Gear'' Series 2 Episode 10, July 20, 2003</ref>  Another requirement was that the car should possess torsional rigidity of 37,000 [[newton metre|Nm]]/[[degree (angle)|degree]].

The Phaeton's platform, the [[Volkswagen Group D platform#D1s|Volkswagen Group D1 platform]], is shared with the [[Bentley Continental GT]] and [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur (2005)|Bentley Continental Flying Spur]].  Certain systems, such as the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] and some [[internal combustion engine]]s, are also shared with the [[Audi A8]].  The D1 is a stand-alone steel platform, and was specifically developed for the Phaeton and Bentley Continental.  It is commonly confused with Audi's D3 platform, which is an all-[[aluminium]]-based, instead of the D1's steel platform.

As of 2005, the Phaeton has the longest [[wheelbase]] in the Volkswagen Passenger Car line.

The Phaeton is hand-assembled in an eco-friendly factory with a glass exterior, the [[Transparent Factory]] ({{lang-de|Gläserne Manufaktur}}) in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]].  This factory also assembled Bentley Continental Flying Spur vehicles destined for the European market until October 2006, when all assembly of the Bentley products was transferred to [[Crewe, England]].

The Phaeton body is fabricated and painted at the large Volkswagen works at Zwickau, Germany, and the completed bodies are then transported about 100 km by special road transport vehicles to the Transparent Factory. Most Phaeton engines, the W12 being the notable exception, are built at the VW/Porsche/Audi engine plant in Győr, Hungary.

==Features==
Development of the vehicle led to over 100 individual patents specific to the Phaeton.  Distinctive features include a draftless four-zone climate system, air compressor [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system, and standard [[Torsen]]-based [[4motion]] [[four-wheel drive]].  With the ''Klavier Lack'' ([[piano]] [[lacquer]]) option, the vehicle is double-painted and sanded between the first and second paint application.

==Sales==
Much like its older cousin, the [[Volkswagen Passat]] W8, Phaeton sales fell short of expectations.  It debuted at prices comparable to similar offerings from [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], [[Lexus]] and, not least, the Volkswagen Group's own [[Audi A8]] (which shared its engineering underpinnings with the Phaeton), while lacking the "brand cachet" of these competitor vehicles.

In 2002 the manufacturer stated that the annual capacity of the new Phaeton plant at [[Dresden]] was 20,000:  by September 2006, a four-year total of just 25,000 had been built<ref>''skript manufaktura'' – Magazin der Gläsernen Manufaktur Dresden, Nr.&nbsp;7, Herbst/Winter 2006, Seite 63</ref>, with production running at approximately 6,000 cars annually.  The domestic market is by far the Phaeton's strongest, with 19,314 Phaetons delivered in Germany alone by January 2009.   The German luxury sedan sector continued to be dominated by the [[Mercedes-Benz W221|Mercedes Benz S-Class]] and [[BMW 7 Series (E65)|BMW 7 series]], however, both models achieving more than twice the sales volume of the Phaeton in 2008.

In the [[United States]] market, 1,433 Phaetons were sold in 2004, but just 820 were sold in 2005, leading the company to announce that sales in the American market would end after the 2006 model year.  The rare [[W12 engine|W12-engine]]d models have depreciated significantly, and sell for a small fraction of their original cost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/autos/Clever-kaufen-und-Geld-sparen-Restwerte-bei-Gebrauchten--/artikel/s/2605/1
|title=Gebrauchtschnäppchen Phaeton}} {{de icon}}</ref>

In April 2008, Volkswagen announced plans to reintroduce the Phaeton to the [[United States]] market in 2009.<ref>{{cite web 
|url=http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/0,1518,547518,00.html
|title=Spiegel online}} {{de icon}}</ref> As of November 2009, no Phaetons have been shipped to the US for sale at VW dealers.

==Powertrain==
As of 2007, [[powertrain]] options for the Phaeton include following [[internal combustion engine]]s.<ref>All data: {{cite book |title=Automobile Revue 2007 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Espace Media Groupe |location=Bern |ISBN=978-3-905386-07-3 |pages=519–520}}</ref>  [[4motion]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] is the only driveline system available. A front wheel drive only configuration was available with the 3.2L engine during MY 2003 and 2004 only.

Vehicles manufactured for sale in the North American market were only available with the 4.2L V8 and 6.0L W12 engine, both of which were electronically limited to 210 km/h (130 mph).

The Phaeton features a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;5.7 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]], with [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS), [[Electronic brakeforce distribution|Electronic Brakeforce Distribution]] (EBD), Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR) [[traction control system]], Electronic Differential Lock (EDL), [[engine braking|Engine Braking Control]] (EBC), with emergency [[Brake Assist]] (BA).

Note: The electronic differential lock (EDL) employed by Volkswagen is not, as the name suggests, a differential lock at all.  Sensors monitor roadwheel speeds across an individual driven axle, and if one wheel is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping) the EDL system momentarily brakes it.  This effectively transfers power to the other wheel.

==2009 Phaeton==
For the 2009 [[model year]], Volkswagen gave the exterior and interior of the Phaeton a minor facelift to better align it with its competitors.  This update included new LED daytime running lights, as well as a freshened centre console with revamped controls and materials.  New [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) [[V6 engine|V6]] [[petrol engine]] with greater power and fuel efficiency (206&nbsp;kW / 280 PS) which satisfy Euro-5 emissions standards is also available.

Other changes to the 2009 model year car now being launched include: three new types of alloy wheels (17, 18 and 19&nbsp;[[inch]]), a slightly modified radiator [[grille]], three new exterior colours, the new leather colour, the new wood trims, white switch illumination instead of red, accent and switch trim in the new "Warm gray" colour, an upgraded car key, makeup mirror in the rear on the long version, dampers optimised for low-friction, [[reinforced carbon-carbon#similar products|Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide]] (C/SiC) ceramic composite brakes (front) on the Phaeton W12, as well as a rearview camera (Rear Assist).
