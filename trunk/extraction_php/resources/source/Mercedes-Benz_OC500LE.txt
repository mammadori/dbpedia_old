The '''Mercedes-Benz OC500LE''' is a modular, heavy-duty, twin-axle [[bus]] [[chassis]] produced by [[Mercedes-Benz]]/[[EvoBus]] Ibérica [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A.]] in [[Sámano]], [[Spain]]. It was designed as a base for low-entry city, suburban, and intercity buses weighing a maximum of 18,000&nbsp;kg. It has much in common with the chassis used for the [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] integral bus range. The engine is horizontally-mounted over the rear overhang.

Large numbers of buses built on the OC500LE chassis can be found in [[Australia]], where it is marketed as the "O 500LE" (it has special adjustments and minor changes for the Australian market). Particularly notable are the O 500LE/[[Volgren]] [[CNG]]-fuelled buses currently being delivered to the city of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in [[Western Australia]] for operation on the [[Transperth]] suburban bus network.

State Transit Authority (Sydney buses) in NSW, Australia are taking delivery of 255 Mercedes OC 500LE CNG units with Custom Coaches CB60 Evo II bodies. Weight and performance issues has delayed the delivery of these vehicles from mid 2007 until June 2008 and finally arriving in early January 2009.

Many operators across Australia have now purchased the O 500LE in various configurations. Problems related to quality control and unreliable electronics have not been uncommon. A lot of these complaints have come from drivers due to some units being under-powered, uncomfortable or rough.

Brisbane Transport withdrew their O 500LEs from the fleet for a short period because of a major unidentified fault which caused buses to suddenly accelerate without warning. This problem was reportedly fixed by Mercedes-Benz and these vehicles are now back on the road.

In January 2009, [[Mercedes-Benz]] Australia/Pacific Pty Ltd issued a recall on 443 CNG-fuelled OC500LE units due to respecified welding specifications for the [[turbocharger]] oil supply pipe.<ref>http://www.recalls.gov.au/view_recall_detail.php?Recall_ID_Auto=16106</ref>

[[File: SMRT SMB69M on 190.JPG|thumb|right|SMRT Buses Mercedes-Benz OC500LE Batch 2]]
[[SMRT Buses]] had taken delivery of 134 Mercedes-Benz OC500LEs for fleet replacement and expansion. These buses feature bodywork built by Thonburi Busbody Limited Thailand <ref>http://www.busandtrucks.com/online/page.php?a=1&n=11</ref> with a CapaCity licenced front from [[Mercedes Benz]], engines that meet [[Euro 5]] emissions standards and are wheelchair accessible. They were the first to feature voice announcement system, with announcements similar to the ones used on the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]]. They are also the first buses in South-East Asia to be fitted with a Euro 5 engine. The last bus, SMB134H, was registered on [[1 October]] [[2009]].

====Demonstrator====
The first OC500LE took part in the launch of SMRT's Go Green event on [[30 April]] [[2008]]. The bus was later registered as SMB1H and initially entered revenue service on Service 190 on [[29 June]] [[2008]]. It was later redeployed to operate on Service 172, only half a year into service.

====First Production Batch====
Beginning from the first production batch of buses, slight modifications were made. For example, they include a bigger LAWO side and rear electronic route number display.

Buses in this batch were registered in the ranges of SMB2E to SMB67T. The first few units of this batch were put to service from [[22 September]] [[2008]] onwards and their deployments are spread across two depots, namely the Ang Mo Kio Depot and Kranji Depot. They can be mostly found on WAB-certified services such as 171 , 172 , 189 , 307 , 811 , 851 and 945.

====Second Production Batch====
The second production batch featured many more differences as compared to its first batch counterparts, most notably its interior. Blue as well as purple colour schemes were used on the seats in contrast to the first batch's corporate colour seats. Stickers greeting onboard passengers can be found at the front and the rear of the bus. A blue tint situated on the top of the windscreen below the Electronic Destination System reduces glare from the sun, and more grab poles and aircon outlets were added at the last few rows of seats.

They were registered from SMB68R till SMB134H. The first few units commenced passenger service on [[1 July]] [[2009]], almost a year to the day the first unit of the OC500LE (SMB1H) made its first trip. Similar to the first production batch, the buses are depolyed to Ang Mo Kio Depot and Kranji Depot. The remaining of the buses are deployed to the Woodlands Depot.

===SBS Transit===
[[SBS Transit]] received one unit of the Mercedes-Benz OC500LE for demonstraton purposes in early [[2009]]. It features bodywork built by Gemilang.

Currently, the customer can choose from either a [[ZF Friedrichshafen AG|ZF]]-Ecomat 6-speed [[automatic transmission]] with integrated hydraulic retarder (model 6HP 502 for engines with 1050 Nm or 1100 Nm maximum torque, or model 6HP 592 for engines with 1250 Nm maximum torque) or a [[Voith AG|Voith]] DIWA 864.3E 4-speed automatic transmission with integrated hydraulic retarder. All diesel-fuelled units sold in Australia prior to 2005 featured ZF 5HP 502 transmissions and a taller final drive ratio.

==Body lengths==
The OC 500 LE can have a total body [[length]] of between 10.8 m and 13.5 m.

A low-entry articulated chassis, called the [[Mercedes-Benz O500U|O500UA]] is also available. It is produced by Mercedes-Benz do Brasil.

==Euro 4 and Euro 5==
The OC 500 LE chassis is now available with a Euro 4-compliant diesel engine using [[AdBlue]] [[Selective Catalytic Reduction]] technology. With Euro 4/5, the 252 hp rating of the OM 457 hLA will be discontinued. Therefore the OC 500 LE will have a 299 hp engine as standard.
