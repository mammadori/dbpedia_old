The '''Rumpler Tropfenwagen''' ("Rumpler drop car", named after its shape) was a car developed by [[Austria]]n engineer [[Edmund Rumpler]].

Rumpler, born in [[Vienna]], was a designer of aircraft when on the 1921's [[Berlin]] car show he introduced the Tropfenwagen. It was to be the first ''streamline car'' (beating the American [[Chrysler Airflow]] and Czech [[Tatra (car)|Tatra]] T107). The Rumpler had a [[Drag Coefficient|C<sub>w</sub>-value]] of only 0.28. The measuring, which was run at a [[Volkswagen]] windtunnel in 1979, surprised engineers of the day; Volkswagen wouldn't beat the value until 1988 with the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]].

The car featured a [[W engine|W]]6 engine, being the first [[mid-engine]] layout ever. It had three banks of paired cylinders, all working on a common crankshaft. Due to bumpy operation it was later replaced by a 4 cylinder [[straight engine]].

Rumpler patented the [[swing axle]] suspension design, as well as the [[transaxle]]. The transaxle was used in some of the most significant vehicles of the 20th Century: the [[Mini]], the [[VW Beetle]], the [[Porsche 356]] and [[Porsche 911|911]] among others.

The driver's seat was in the middle, with a 2-seat bench behind, and, since 1923, 2 additional tip-up seats.

Although the car was very advanced for its time, it sold poorly â€” about 100 cars were built. Little problems at the start (cooling, steering), the appearance of the vehicle, and the absence of a luggage compartment hurt sales. The car was sold almost solely as a taxi, where easy boarding and the high ceiling were advantages. The last cars were built in 1925.

The car did become famous, thanks to the film [[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]], in which Rumplers found a burning end. 

Only 2 examples are known to exist still today, one in the [[Deutsches Museum]]'s Verkehrszentrum in [[Munich]] and one in the [[Deutsches Technikmuseum Berlin]].
