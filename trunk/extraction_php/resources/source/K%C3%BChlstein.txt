The '''Kühlstein Wagenbau''' in [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]] was a [[coachbuilding]] company that produced [[electric car]]s from 1898 to 1902. Some were vehicles of in-house design, others were [[Jeantaud]] cabs built under licence. The firm also built tractor units to replace horses for use with [[horse-drawn carriage]]s. Later models were also known as ''Kühlstein-Vollmer''. Production of these vehicles was absorbed by the [[Neue Automobil Gesellschaft]] (NAG) in 1902. Kühlstein continued manufacturing [[coachwork]]s, e.g. for [[Horch]] cars.
