The [[BMW]] '''S85B50''' is a [[DOHC]] 40-valve [[V10 engine|V10]] [[automotive]] [[piston]] [[engine]] found on the [[BMW E60|E60]] [[BMW M5|M5]] and [[BMW E63|E63]] [[BMW M6|M6]]. It was inspired by BMW's formula 1 racing division.

==Technology & Performance==

The S85B50 is a high-revving engine designed to utilize power from a wide rev band. Having a redline of 8250 rpm, it achieves over {{convert|100|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}/litre and features a very high compression ratio of 12.0:1, beating the previous M3 of 11.5:1 

*5.0 Litre V10 engine, {{Convert|507|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 7750rpm/{{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} torque @ 6100rpm

*Cast aluminum block with bed plate design split at the crankshaft axis.

*Cast aluminum heads with four valves per cylinder and CNC machined ports and combustion chambers. Valves are actuated though non-rotating inverted bucked cam followers.

*Oil cooled forged aluminum pistons from Mahle Motorsport

*Forged steel crankshaft with counterweights

*Double [[VANOS]] system which varies both intake and exhaust cam phasing

*10 individual electronically controlled throttles

*Knock sensors have been eliminated by utilizing the "ionic current" measuring system. Using the ionic current system, engine misfires as well as knock can be measured simultaneously. Combustion quality raises or lowers cylinder pressure. The ionic current is measured by passing a low voltage across the spark plugs immediately following the ignition spark.

*Quasi-dry sump lubricating system 

*The Digital Motor Electronic (DME) of the S85B50 is encrypted heavily to prevent modifications/hacking to the software.

* The firing order for the S85 engine is 1-6-5-10-2-7-3-8-4-9. [http://users.on.net/~sa145/E60_M5_Complete_Vehicle.pdf]
