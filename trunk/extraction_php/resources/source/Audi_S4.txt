The '''Audi S4''' name was originally used for the [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] sport version of the [[Audi 100]] [[automobile|car]], and has subsequently been used for similar versions of the [[Audi A4]] series.

[[automotive engineering|Manufactured]] at [[Audi|Audi AG's]] [[Ingolstadt]] plant in [[Germany]], they are, or have been available as a five-[[vehicle door|door]] five-[[automobile seat|seat]] Avant, Audi's name for an [[station wagon|estate car]] (station wagon), a four-door five-seat [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] (sedan), and a two-door four-seat Cabriolet ([[convertible]]) [[car body style|version]].  Furthermore, their [[internal combustion engine]]s are all [[front-engine design|front-mounted]], and are [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally]] orientated.  Irrespective of the type of [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] offered, they are all mounted immediately at the rear of the engine in a longitudinal orentation, in the form of a [[transaxle]].

Like all [[Audi S and RS models#S models|Audi 'S' cars]], the S4 is only available with Audi's [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] [[four-wheel drive]] (4WD) system, with differing variations of the S4 utilising either the [[Torsen]]-based permanent full-time 4WD, or a [[transfer case|transfer box]] based 4WD.<ref name="ETKA">[[ETKA]] official factory data</ref>  The S4 has a larger more powerful [[internal combustion engine]], larger uprated [[brake]]s, and uprated stiffer [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension systems]] - all of which are not shared with the remainder of the A4 range.<ref>AudiWorld.com [http://www.audiworld.com/model/s4/content.shtml North American S4 Model Guide] - historical S4 specifications, prices, and options</ref>

Audi was reconfiguring its model range during the early 1990s, and introduced the original '''Audi S4''' ('''''Typ'' 4A''') in 1992, as the performance version of the restyled [[Audi 100#C4|Audi 100 (C4)]] four-[[vehicle door|door]], five-[[automobile seat|seat]] saloon.  Despite being based on the [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C4|Volkswagen Group C4 platform]], and sharing its basic structure with the 100, the S4 effectively took the place of the Audi 200 quattro turbo, which had been discontinued the year before.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Preview: Audi S4|author=Stephen L. Thompson|journal=[[Car and Driver]]|issue=March 1992|pages=79&ndash;80}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Magnum Force|author=rodrigo gato|journal=[[Car and Driver]]|issue=April 1992|pages=47&ndash;56}}</ref>  Being the first S4 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the ''[[Audi Ur-S4 / Ur-S6|Ur-S4]]'', derrived from the [[German language]] augmentive word - '''Ur'''sprünglich (meaning: original).

Following Audi's decision in discontinuing the 100 nameplate, it [[badge engineering|re-badged]] the car as the [[Audi A6]] in 1994, and the S4 became the S6, although the only real changes to the model were minor cosmetic updates, and the addition of a more powerful limited edition S6 Plus model using the [[V8 engine]].  After the first generation A6 was replaced in 1997 by an updated version based on C5 chassis, the S4 and S6 became distinctly separate from one another.

===C4 powertrain===
The [[powertrain]] detail of the C4 S4 featured a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] version of Audi's 2.2&nbsp;[[litre]] - {{convert|2226|cc|1|lk=on}} - [[multi-valve|20-valve]] [[straight-five engine|inline five cylinder]] [[petrol engine]], (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN), developing {{convert|169|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} and {{convert|350|Nm|0|lk=on}} of torque.<ref name="ETKA"/>  [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] [[engine control unit]] took care of all functions of the engine management.<ref name="ETKA"/>

Standard [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] offerings<ref name="ETKA"/> were a [[manual transmission|manual gearbox]] (parts code prefix: 01E) - five- (identification codes: CBD, CET) and six-speed (identification codes: CBL, CMG) in Europe, five-speed only in [[North America]], although a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] (parts code prefix: 01F, identification code: CBF) was available as an option.  [[Torsen]]-based (T-1) [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent four-wheel drive (4wd) was standard on manual transmissions, and a [[transfer case|transfer box]] based 4wd was standard on automatic transmission variants.<ref name="ETKA"/>  Final drive ratio is either 4.111 or 3.889 (dependent on transmission type), and the rear axle uses a driver-selectable electro-pneumatic-mechanical switchable [[locking differential|diff lock]] (parts code prefix: 017, identification codes: AAT, AET).<ref name="ETKA"/>

A {{convert|206|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} 4.2&nbsp;litre all-[[aluminium alloy]] [[V8 engine]] (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#4.2 V8 206kW|ABH]]) became available to [[Europe]]an customers as an option from October 1992, only with the manual gearbox.<ref name="ETKA"/>

The configuration of the 2.2&nbsp;litre engine and five-speed manual transmission offered good acceleration for its day, achieving {{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in just 6.2&nbsp;[[second]]s.

===C4 steering, brakes, wheels & tyres===
The C4 S4 came equipped with [[power steering|power assisted]] (PAS) rack and pinion [[steering]] as standard.<ref name="ETKA"/>  An electronically controlled variable assisted '[[power steering#servotronic|servotronic]]' version was also available.<ref name="ETKA"/>

There were two different types of high performance [[brake]] systems on offer for the C4 S4.<ref name="ETKA"/>  From its' introduction, it had the unusual 'UFO' styled front [[disc brake]]s.  These were sized at {{convert|310|mm|2|lk=on}} in diameter by {{convert|25|mm|3|abbr=on}} thick, and were radially ventilated, but mounted the [[ATE]] single-piston sliding caliper inside the bell-shaped disc.  With the introduction of the V8 engine, the S4 changed to more conventional front brakes across the range.  Again radially ventilated, the front discs were now sized at {{convert|314|mm|2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|30|mm|3|abbr=on}}, with the [[LucasVarity|Lucas]]-[[Lucas Industries#girling|Girling]] single pot caliper mounted in the conventional external position.  The rears, again radially ventilated, were sized at {{convert|269|mm|2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|20|mm|3|abbr=on}}, and used a Lucas-Girling single-piston sliding caliper, with integrated cable-actuated handbrake mechanism.  A [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] three-channel (four-channel sensing) [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS), with mechanical load sensing valve (for the rear brakes) was also standard.

Standard [[wheel|roadwheels]]<ref name="ETKA"/> were 7.5Jx16H2&nbsp;ET37 six-arm 'Avus' forged [[alloy wheel]]s with 225/50&nbsp;R16 [[tire|tyre]]s.  Three optional alloy wheel and tyre packages were available - a 7.5Jx15H2&nbsp;ET40 six-spoke alloy wheel, with 215/60&nbsp;R15 tyres, an 8.0Jx16H2&nbsp;ET40 five double-spoke alloy, or an 8.0Jx17H2&nbsp;ET40 ten-spoke alloy were also available.{{-}}

[[Image:Audis4avant b5.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Audi B5 S4 Avant]]
The second generation S4 ('''''Typ'' 8D'''), now correctly titled '''Audi S4 quattro''' debuted in 1997, with factory production commencing October 1997,<ref name="ETKA"/> as part of the facelifted [[Volkswagen Group B platform#B5|B5 platform]] [[Audi A4#B5|Audi A4]] line-up, although it wasn't available in [[North America]] until late 1999.

In addition to the [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] (sedan), an [[station wagon|estate]] version (wagon) - the Audi S4 Avant, was introduced into the lineup from 1998.  Production of the B5 S4 ceased in September 2001,<ref name="ETKA"/> although it was still sold together with the next B6 platform generation through 2002 in North America.

Several years after it was sold new, the B5 S4 remains a potent enthusiast car, and as featured in the December 2007 issue of Sport Compact Car magazine, a Torque Factory tuned S4 won a comparison test against several other extreme performance cars.<ref>Sport Compact Car magazine [http://www.sportcompactcarweb.com/uscc/0712_sccp_2007_ultimate_street_car_challenge/results.html 2007 Ultimate Street Car Challenge] ''"The Audi S4 ... showed its capability with consistently strong finishes in the acceleration, dyno, braking and driveability tests"''</ref>

===B5 powertrain===
The [[powertrain]] detail<ref name="ETKA"/> of the B5 S4 features a 2.7&nbsp;[[litre]] [[twin-turbo]] ('biturbo') 90° third-generation [[V6 engine]] (parts code prefix: 078, identification codes: AGB, AZB). Detail of the powerplant includes a [[cast iron]] [[cylinder block]] with two lightweight [[aluminium alloy]] [[cylinder head]]s. The [[valvetrain]] includes [[multi-valve|30 valves]] (five valves per [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]),<ref>Audi Self-Study Programme SSP198 - The 2.7-litre V6 biturbo</ref><ref>Audi.com - Glossary [http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/tools/glossary/engine_driveline/five_valves_per_cylinder.html five valves per cylinder]</ref> twin hybrid-driven ([[timing belt]] and [[chain]]) [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshafts]] and [[variable valve timing]] for the inlet [[poppet valve#internal combustion engine|valves]]. The charged intake air is cooled with the aid of two side-mounted [[intercooler]]s (SMICs). It [[engine displacement|displaces]] {{convert|2671|cc|1|lk=on}}, and is [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] rated to produce a [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output of {{convert|195|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}, and generates {{convert|400|Nm|0|lk=on}} of [[torque]]. Engine management was by way of a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] ME&nbsp;7.1 (7.0 in North America) [[engine control unit]] (ECU), and helped it meet the EU-3D emissions standard. For a short [[time scale]] (08/98-12/98) in the North American market, the engine was slightly detuned to meet US emissions regulations, output was reduced to {{convert|187|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|258|ftlb|abbr=on}} (identification code: APB).

As in the previous S4, a six-speed C90 [[manual transmission]] (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DSY) [[gear ratio]]s- 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.231, 4th: 0.967, 5th: 0.806, 6th: 0.684) was standard equipment, as was the Torsen T-2 [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.  Final drive (parts code prefix: 01H, identification code: DQA) ratio is 4.111.  A five-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[ZF 5HP19 transmission#5HP19FLA|5HP19]] [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] (parts code prefix:01V) became available for the first time as an option.<ref name="ETKA"/>

The S4 claims acceleration from {{convert|0|to|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in 5.6&nbsp;[[second]]s, and had an electronically-limited top speed of {{convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on}}, making it both the quickest saloon/sedan in the Audi model line, and among the quickest saloon/sedans in the world at that time.

===B5 brakes, wheels & tyres===
The B5 S4 [[brake]] system<ref name="ETKA"/> consisted of radially ventilated discs, {{convert|321|mm|2|lk=on}} in diameter by {{convert|30|mm|2|abbr=on}} thick up front, and {{convert|256|mm|2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|22|mm|2|abbr=on}} at the rear.  Two-piston Lucas HP2 brake calipers at the front (with four pads per caliper), with Lucas single-piston sliding brake calipers at the rear.  A [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]  ABS&nbsp;5.3 four-channel [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (with [[electronic brakeforce distribution|Electronic Brakeforce Distribution]] (EBD) and Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) - and later with ESP or [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]]), coupled with a [[vacuum servo]] completed the system.

Standard [[wheel|roadwheels]]<ref name="ETKA"/> were Audi's [[die casting|die-cast]] [[aluminium alloy]] six-arm 'Avus' 7.5Jx17H2&nbsp;ET45 [[alloy wheel]]s, shod with 225/45&nbsp;ZR17 performance [[tire|tyres]].

===B5 motorsport===
A [[auto racing|racing]] version of the car achieved great success in the [[SPEED World Challenge|SpeedVision World Challenge]] with Michael Galati taking the 2001 SpeedVision GT title in a [[Champion Racing]] S4, winning four races, and helping Audi to its first Manufacturers' Championship.

The [[Audi#motorsports|Audi Sport]] specification Champion A4 chassis included a [[Audi RS4#B5|B5 RS4]] engine, and [[Alcon Component Limited|Alcon]] racing [[brake caliper]]s - 4-pot fronts and 2-pot rears.{{-}}

[[Image:Audis4b6.jpg|200px|thumb|left|B6 S4 saloon]]
[[Image:Audi s4 red.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Audi B6 S4 Avant]]
The third generation '''Audi S4 quattro''' ('''''Typ'' 8E''' &mdash; saloon: 8E2, Avant: 8E5, and Cabriolet: 8H7) debuted its saloon and Avant [[car body style|bodystyles]] in [[Europe]] in March 2003,<ref name="ETKA"/> and appeared in [[North America]] slightly later.{{When|date=June 2009}}  This was based on the latest [[Volkswagen Group B platform#B6 (PL46)|Volkswagen Group B6 (PL46) platform]] used by the then current [[Audi A4#B6|Audi (B6) A4]].  Despite having moved to an entirely new platform, one of the S4's most publicised new features was its new [[internal combustion engine]] - a 4.2&nbsp;[[litre]] [[V8 engine]].  Following its initial launch of either a four-[[vehicle door|door]] five-[[car seat|seat]] saloon (sedan), or a five-door five-seat Avant (estate/wagon), it eventually became available in three bodystyles - and for the first time in the [[Audi S and RS models#S models|Audi 'S' car range]], from February 2004, a two-door four-seat Cabriolet ([[convertible]]), '''''Typ'' 8H''', was included in the [[model range]].<ref>Audi Technical Data sheets - 2003 S4 quattro - saloon, Avant, and Cabriolet</ref>

Official performance figures for standard discipline of sprinting from standstill to {{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in the saloon with manual transmission are 5.6&nbsp;[[second]]s (Avant 5.8&nbsp;s, Cabriolet 5.9&nbsp;s), however, a road test conducted by the American automotive magazine [[Motor Trend]]<ref>[http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0308_sports_car_comparison/specs_price.html Sports Car Comparison: 2004 Audi S4 vs. 2003 Mercedes-Benz C32 AMG]</ref> indicated that it could go from a standstill to {{convert|60|mph|1|abbr=on}} in less than 5&nbsp;seconds, and make it to {{convert|200|km/h|1|abbr=on}} in slightly over 20&nbsp;seconds, although doing this led to fuel consumption dipping into single digits, considerably lower than the earlier V6 models, leading to the addition of a $1,700 [[Gas Guzzler Tax|gas guzzler tax]] (combined {{convert|20.2|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|lk=on}}) for the six-speed manual sedan in the [[United States]].  Top speed is electronically limited to {{convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.

The B6 S4 saloon and Avant variants ceased factory production in December 2004, with the Cabriolet ending twelve months later at December 2005.<ref name="ETKA"/>

===B6 powertrain===
Replacing the 2.7&nbsp;[[litre]] [[twin-turbo|'biturbo']] [[V6 engine]] of the previous generation B5 S4, the new B6 S4 [[powertrain]]<ref name="ETKA"/> gained an all-[[aluminium alloy]] 4.2&nbsp;litre, [[multi-valve|40 valve]] (five [[poppet valve#internal combustion engine|valves]] per [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]) [[V8 engine]] (parts code prefix: 079.C, identification code: [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#4.2 V8 40v 246-260kW|BBK]]), with twin [[chain]]-driven (at the rear of the [[internal combustion engine|engine]]) [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshafts]] (DOHC) (two per [[cylinder bank]] - 'quad cam'), roller [[rocker arm|valve followers]], and included [[variable valve timing|variable inlet camshaft timing]].  It also utilised a strengthened alloy [[crankshaft]] bedplate for the five [[main bearing]]s, and a two-part [[baffle]]d oil [[sump]], and a light-alloy [[variable length intake manifold|variable intake manifold]] (VIM), containing the sequentially fired [[fuel injection|fuel injectors]].  This [[petrol engine]], based on the unit from the [[Audi A8]], [[engine displacement|displaces]] {{convert|4163|cc|1|lk=on}}, and it produces a [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output of {{convert|253|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 7,000&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute]] (rpm), and generates [[torque]] of {{convert|410|Nm|0|lk=on}} at 3,500&nbsp;rpm, making it more potent than the [[Audi RS2 Avant|RS2 Avant]], and nearly as powerful as the [[Audi RS4#B5|B5 RS4]].  Engine management was by way of a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] ME&nbsp;7.1.1 electronic [[engine control unit]], utilising a Bosch 'E-Gas' [[drive by wire]] electronic throttle, and powering eight individual [[ignition coil|spark coils]] with longlife quad-electrode Bosch [[spark plug]]s.  [[Ignition timing]] is a mapped direct [[ignition system|ignition]], with cylinder-selective knock control with the aid of four knock sensors.  The [[exhaust system]] includes [[vacuum]]-operated valves in the twin rear [[muffler|silencers]] (mufflers), finished with [[chrome plating|chrome plated]] tail-pipes.

Like its predecessors, the B6 S4 was standard with a [[Getrag]] six-speed (M6S) manual transmission (parts code prefix: 0A3, identification codes: FVD, HEP) ([[gear ratio]]s - 1st: 3.667, 2nd: 2.050, 3rd: 1.462, 4th: 1.133, 5th: 0.919, 6th: 0.778),<ref name="ETKA"/> with a 240&nbsp;[[millimetre]] single plate dry [[clutch]], and [[Torsen]] T-2 [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.  Final drive (parts code prefix: 01R, identification code: EXZ) ratios are 3.889,<ref name="ETKA"/> giving a top gear road speed to engine revs ratio of 24.4&nbsp;mph per 1000&nbsp;rpm.  From July 2003,<ref name="ETKA"/> the [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[ZF 6HP19 transmission|6HP19]] [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] (parts code prefix: 09L, identification codes: GUR, HHU) (ratios - 1st: 4.171, 2nd: 2.340, 3rd: 1.521, 4th: 1.143, 5th: 0.867, 6th: 0.691, with a final drive (identification code: GDF) ratio of 3.539) was included as an option.

An unusual sight in the engine compartment was the addition of [[water cooling]] for the 190&nbsp;[[ampere|amp]] [[alternator#automotive alternators|alternator]],<ref name="ETKA"/> along with two additional [[thermostat]]ically-controlled side-mounted [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiators]].<ref name="ETKA"/>

===B6 steering, brakes, wheels & tyres===
The B6 S4 came equipped with electronically controlled variable assisted '[[power steering#servotronic|servotronic]]' [[power steering|power assisted]] (PAS) rack and pinion [[steering]] as standard.<ref name="ETKA"/>

B6 S4 [[brake]]s<ref name="ETKA"/> consisted of radially ventilated [[disc brake]]s front and rear.  The front discs are sized at {{convert|345|mm|2|lk=on}} in diameter by {{convert|30|mm|3|abbr=on}} thick, and are clamped by [[Continental AG|Continental Teves-ATE]] FNRG-60 single-piston sliding [[disc brake#calipers|brake calipers]].  The rears are {{convert|300|mm|2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|22|mm|3|abbr=on}}, and again use single-piston sliding calipers, with an integrated cable-operated [[hand brake]] mechanism.  A [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;5.7 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] system, complete with [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS), [[electronic brakeforce distribution|Electronic Brakeforce Distribution]] (EBD), [[Emergency Brake Assist]] (EBA), Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) and Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR) - also known as [[traction control system]], coupled with a dual-rate tandem [[vacuum servo]] provided the brake actuation.

Standard [[alloy wheel]]s<ref name="ETKA"/> were 'Avus-III' [[die casting|die-cast]] aluminium alloy, 8.0Jx18H2&nbsp;ET45 in size, and shod with 235/40&nbsp;ZR18&nbsp;95Y eXtraLoad high performance [[tire|tyres]], being either [[Continental AG|Continental]] SportContact2 or [[Michelin]] PilotSport PS2.

===B6 body & interior===
Discrete lower [[vehicle door|door]] trims, along with the now trademark [[Audi S and RS models#S models|Audi 'S' model]] vertical-emphasis line [[grille]], and solid [[aluminium]] (later replaced with mock aluminium plastic) exterior [[wing mirror|door mirrors]], and S4 badging front and rear are all that visually distinguish the S4 from its related A4 brethren.  In the interior, front and rear [[Recaro]] [[automobile seat|seats]] (fronts fully electric), standard [[carbon fiber|carbon fibre]] trims, as well as S4 logos in the instrument panel and door sills complete the detail.{{-}}

[[Image:AudiS4 B7 Avant.jpg|200px|thumb|left|rear view of Audi B7 S4 Avant]]
The Audi B7 platform '''Audi S4 quattro''', based on the B7 [[Audi A4#B7|Audi A4]], debuted in late 2005.  Although Audi classifies it as a new car, the differences between it and the outgoing B6 S4 casually appear to be primarily cosmetic, and is still classified by the internal designation: '''''Typ'' 8E''' (although with revised sub-designations - saloon: 8EC, Avant: 8ED, and Cabriolet: 8HE).<ref name="ETKA"/>  It has the same 4.2&nbsp;[[litre]] [[V8 engine]] (identification code: [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#4.2 V8 40v 246-260kW|BBK]]) as the B6 S4, producing a [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output of {{convert|253|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 7,000&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute]] (rpm), and {{convert|410|Nm|0|lk=on}} [[torque]] at 3,500&nbsp;rpm.

There are a few mechanical changes, such as revised [[spring (device)|springs]] and dampers and, from [[model year]] 2007, an updated [[Torsen]] T-3 centre differential, featuring a default asymmetric 40:60 front-rear torque split on manual transmission models, along with the later [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;8.0 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]]<ref name="ETKA"/> and gloss black painted [[disc brake#calipers|brake calipers]].<ref name="ETKA"/>  The 'Avus-III' [[wheel|roadwheels]] now became an option, and were replaced by a standard offering 8.0Jx18&nbsp;[[inch]] 'S-design' 7-spoke forged [[alloy wheel]].<ref name="ETKA"/>

[[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system is now standard, whereas it was optional on the B6 S4, and an enhanced optional [[DVD|DVD-ROM]]-based RNS-E satellite navigation system replaces the previous [[CD-ROM]]-based RNS-D option.

The new [[trapezoid]]al single-frame [[grille]], Bi-[[xenon arc lamp|Xenon]] [[high-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] headlamps, L-shaped tail-lamps, quad [[exhaust system|exhaust]] tail pipes, and discrete V8 badging below the side repeater indicators help distinguish the B7 from the previous B6 model.

===Audi S4 25quattro{{anchor|25quattro}}===
[[Image:2006 Audi S4 25quattro.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Audi "S4 25quattro" special edition]]
In June 2005,<ref name="ETKA"/> Audi announced a limited edition run of 250 special edition S4 saloon cars, celebrating 25 years of [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] four wheel drive.  This exclusive model was called the '''Audi S4 25quattro'''.  Available only in the [[United States]], and only in Avus Silver, the exterior has unique front and rear bumpers, a [[carbon fiber|carbon fibre]] boot lip spoiler and lower front splitter.  15-spoke DTM alloys, along with optional dealer-fitted Audi rings decals for the front doors complete the exterior makeover.  Black and grey contrasting interior leathers, along with "quattro" embossed into the [[Recaro]] seats, together with an individually numbered exclusive quattro gear shift knob for the manual-only gearbox define the interior changes.

On the mechanical side, the S4 25quattro was the second Audi, after the [[Audi RS4#B7|B7 RS4]] to be fitted with the latest [[Torsen]] T-3 asymmetric ATB centre differential for its quattro permanent four-wheel drive system.  Under normal grip conditions, this is set with a default rearwards torque distribution bias of 40:60 front to rear, and a maximum of 100% torque can automatically be apportioned to the rear axle (and up to 80% to the front) as conditions warrant.  The final drive ratios are 3.889.{{-}}

[[Image:Audi S4 B8 Kombi rear 20090412.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Audi B8 S4 Avant]]
From November 2008, the latest generation of the '''Audi S4 quattro'''<ref>Audi.co.uk [http://www.audi.co.uk/audi/uk/en2/new_cars/a4/s4_saloon.html Audi S4]</ref> ('''''Typ'' 8K''') entered factory production.<ref name="ETKA"/>  It is based on the current [[Audi A4#B8|Audi B8 A4]],<ref>AudiWorld.com News [http://www.audiworld.com/news/07/b8-s4-exclusive-preview/ Performance Preview: exclusive look at the B8 S4] 18 November 2007</ref> built on the [[Volkswagen Group B platform#B8|Volkswagen Group MLB/MLP]] platform.  Unlike the previous B6 and B7 models, the new B8 version will only be available as a four-[[vehicle door|door]] five-[[car seat|seat]] saloon (sedan), or a five-door five-seat Avant (estate/wagon).  The sport-performance two-door four-seat [[cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] ([[convertible]]) mantle is now taken by the current [[Audi A5#S5|Audi S5]].

Compared to the previous B6/B7 S4, this latest B8 S4 utilises a smaller [[engine displacement|displacement]] 3.0&nbsp;[[litre]] TFSI [[V6 engine|V6]] [[internal combustion engine]], but with the addition of [[forced induction]].

Acceleration from standstill to {{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} takes 5.1&nbsp;[[second]]s<ref name="Audi Germany"/> for the saloon with manual gearbox, the Avant one tenth of a second slower at 5.2&nbsp;seconds.  The same dash to 100&nbsp;km/h in the saloon with S tronic takes 5.3&nbsp;seconds, and the Avant at 5.4&nbsp;seconds.  The top speed is electronically limited to {{convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.  With figures like these, the B8 S4 accelerates more quickly than any of its predecessors.

Audi of America claims the American version of the S4 achieves 28 highway miles per gallon and a 0 to 60&nbsp;mph acceleration time of 4.9 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 2010 Audi S4 is finally here|url=http://www.audisite.com/912/2010-audi-s4/|publisher=AudiSite.com|date= |accessdate= }}</ref>  Fuel consumption is rated at a combined {{convert|24.2|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|lk=on}}<ref name="Audi Germany">[http://www.audi.de/de/brand/de/neuwagen/a4/s4_limousine/technische_daten_und.html Audi Germany]</ref>.  Therefore, the B8 S4, unlike the V8-powered B6/7 models, avoids the US [[Gas Guzzler Tax|gas guzzler tax]].

A new designed [[wheel|roadwheel]] is included on the B8 S4, an 8.5Jx18" '5-double-spoke S' design [[alloy wheel]] with 245/40&nbsp;ZR18 high performance [[tire|tyres]].  Optional 19&nbsp;[[inch]] wheel and tyre packages are also available, sized at 8.5Jx19" alloy wheels with 255/35&nbsp;ZR19 tyres.  LED tail lights are standard fitment, along with Audi's trademark LED daytime running lights at the front.

===B8 powertrain===
At the heart of the B8 S4 [[powertrain]] is an all-new, all [[aluminium-alloy]] 3.0&nbsp;[[litre]] TFSI [[supercharger|supercharged]] [[V6 engine]] (parts code prefix: ???, identification code: [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#3.0 V6 TFSI 213-245kW|CAK]]),<ref name="ETKA"/> and like the rest of the B8 model range, now with [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI).  This [[petrol engine]], based on the unit from the facelifted [[Audi A6]], [[engine displacement|displaces]] {{convert|2995|cc|1|lk=on}}, and it produces a [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output of {{convert|245|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}.  [[Torque]] is rated at {{convert|440|Nm|0|lk=on}} from 2,900 to 5,300&nbsp;rpm.  This high power output is achieved by utilising [[forced induction]]–and specifically, an all-new [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] [[TVS Supercharger|'Twin Vortices Series' (TVS)]] Roots-type positive displacement compressor.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Parks|title=Audi Selects Eaton TVS Supercharger To Power Fuel Efficient V6|url=http://www.eaton.com/EatonCom/SearchResults/CT_167907 |work=Eaton Corporation|publisher=Eaton.com|date=2008-07-17|accessdate=2009-07-24|quote=''when paired with direct injection and enhanced transmission ratio, the TVS supercharger helps the engine achieve 290 hp with an average fuel economy of nearly 24 miles per gallon''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Parks|title=Eaton TVS Supercharger Featured On 2010 Audi S4/S4 Avant|url=http://www.eaton.com/EatonCom/SearchResults/CT_193399 |work=Eaton Corporation|publisher=Eaton.com|date=2008-11-06|accessdate=2009-07-24|quote=''When combined with direct injection, the TVS surpasses twin turbochargers in packaging, starting performance and responsiveness''}}</ref>  This new blower features twin four-lobe rotors, which are twisted 160-degrees.  It is mounted on top of the engine, within the 'Vee', pumping air directly into the inlet manifold.  This new design of supercharger is said to reduce the [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH) of the engine.

This engine is mated to either a six-speed [[manual transmission]] (identification code: KMR)<ref name="ETKA"/> or a seven-speed '[[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S tronic]]' DL501<ref name=DCTfactsS4>{{cite web|title=Audi S4 Avant On The Road|url=http://www.dctfacts.com/otr_pg4.asp|work=The Lubrizol Corporation|publisher=DCTfacts.com|date=14 July 2009|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref> [[dual clutch transmission]]<ref>PaulTan.org blog [http://paultan.org/archives/2008/09/23/b8-audi-s4-sedan-and-avant-unveiled/ B8 Audi S4 Sedan and Avant unveiled!]</ref> (identification code: LHK),<ref name="ETKA"/> the latter with steering wheel mounted paddle-shifters for [[tiptronic]] control.  The 'Audi quattro Sports differential' fitted in the rear axle final drive unit is available as an option.{{-}}
