The '''Porsche 914-6 GT''' was a [[race car]] built and sold collaboratively by [[Volkswagen]] and [[Porsche]].

==History==
The Porsche 914 was introduced in September 1969 as a collaborative effort between Porsche and Volkswagen to produce a sporty car. The car they came up with was a [[mid-engine]]d vehicle with seating for two and featured a [[targa top]]. A [[4-cylinder]] [[boxer engine]] provided the power. Volkswagen needed a vehicle to replace the aging [[Karmann-Ghia]] while Porsche was looking for another option to add to their line up. The 914 in Europe were badged as Volkswagen/Porsche, while all 914's sold in [[North America]] were sold as Porsches.

The car sits very low and the [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] was a combination of a 911-type torsion bar front suspension with a rear coil spring suspension. The headlights hide in the hood and pop-up when needed. The targa top can be stored in the trunk.

The horizontally opposed flat-four engine is mid-mounted and was produced with different displacements; 1.7, 1.8 or 2.0 liter. The 1.7 liter engine produced {{Convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the 1.8 produced 79, and the 2.0 liter engine produced 95. A five-speed [[manual gearbox]] was standard equipment on all models.

The 914/6 was short lived with only 3360 examples produced between 1970 and 1972. All featured the 2.0 liter [[flat-six]] engine. It was raced using different engine configurations. This included the 'T' specification, which was basically a stock 911 engine. Another popular configuration was to use a converted Carrera 6 engine.

In 1970 Porsche entered a 914/6 GT in the grueling [[24 hours of Le Mans]] race. It finished 6th overall and won its class. This was only one chapter in the vehicle's extensive racing career, which continues even to this day.
