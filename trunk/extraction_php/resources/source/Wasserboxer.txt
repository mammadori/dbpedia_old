The '''Volkswagen wasserboxer''' is a four [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[flat engine|horizontally opposed]] [[overhead valve|pushrod overhead valve]] (OHV) [[petrol engine]] developed by [[Volkswagen]].  The engine is [[water cooling|watercooled]], and takes its name from the {{lang-de|"wasserboxer"}}; which when translated into English, means "water-boxer" - or water-cooled boxer - with boxer being an alternative name for a horizontally opposed engine.  It was available in two [[engine displacement|displacements]] - either a 1.9&nbsp;[[litre]]<ref name=ETKA/> or a 2.1&nbsp;litre;<ref name=ETKA/> the 2.1&nbsp;litre being a longer [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] version of the 1.9&nbsp;litre, both variants sharing the same [[bore (engine)|cylinder bore]].<ref name=ETKA/>  This engine was unique to the [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)]] (Transporter T3 / Caravelle / Vanagon / T25), having never been used in any other vehicle.<ref name=ETKA/>

==Design detail==
The Wasserboxer featured a [[casting|cast]] [[aluminium alloy]] [[cylinder block]], [[cylinder head]]s, and [[piston]]s; and a [[forging|forged]] [[steel]] flatplane [[crankshaft]] with three [[main bearing]]s.<ref name=ETKA/>

The Wasserboxer, as with all Volkswagen boxer engines, directly drives the three-bearing [[camshaft]] via a small steel gear on the crankshaft, and a large aluminium one on the camshaft, so there is no [[timing belt]] or timing chain.  The entire mechanism is internal to the engine, so there should be no concerns regarding wear or replacements, as long as the [[motor oil|engine oil]] is changed regularly.  The [[overhead valve|overhead]] [[poppet valve#internal combustion engine|poppet valves]] each feature two [[concentric]] valve [[spring (device)|springs]], and are operated by pushrods and adjustable rocker arms.<ref name=ETKA/>

It also featured "Heron", or "bowl-in-piston" type [[combustion chamber]]s - where the combustion takes place within the piston area, and not in a recess machined in the cylinder head.<ref name=ETKA/>

The [[cylinder bank]]s contain [[cast iron]] [[cylinder liner]]s inserted into a [[water jacket]], with a "rubber lip" style [[head gasket]], which is a very different design as compared to most vehicles.  The top of the cylinder liners is pressed into a recessed cut-out in the cylinder heads, that are sealed with compressible metal rings, to prevent leakage.<ref name=ETKA/>

Some Wasserboxers were plagued by water jacket gasket failures (often erroneously referred to as head gaskets) due to several design issues.  Engine failure was also a result of poorly placed sensors, corrosion in the cooling system, and many areas subjected to leaks.

This engine is representative of the fact that boxer four cylinders produce an audible low pitch "rumble", rather than a high pitch buzz/whine, when running.  Some find this aspect of the engine to be pleasing, owing to the dislike{{citation needed|date=June 2008}} of the "sewing machine" sound of [[inline-four engine]]s.

The switch to water-cooling for the boxer engines was made mid-year in 1982, because Volkswagen could no longer make the [[air-cooled engine]]s meet [[emission standard|emissions standards]].  (The previous generation [[Volkswagen Type 2#T2|Volkswagen Type 2 (T2)]], currently produced in Brazil, has been switched to water-cooled engines since 23 December 2005 in response to Brazil's emission laws; the power plant used in the previous-generation T2 is an [[Audi]]-sourced inline four.)  Water-cooled models can be distinguished by a second radiator [[grille]].
