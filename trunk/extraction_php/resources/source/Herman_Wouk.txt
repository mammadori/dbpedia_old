'''Herman Wouk''' ({{pron-en|ˈwoʊk}} ''"woke"''; born May 27, 1915) is a bestselling, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Jewish]] [[United States|American]] [[author]] with a number of notable [[novel]]s to his credit, including ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'', ''[[The Winds of War]]'', and ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.

== Biography ==
Herman Wouk was born in [[New York City]] into a [[Jew]]ish family that had [[emigrated]] from [[Russia]].  After a childhood and adolescence in the Bronx and a high school diploma from [[Townsend Harris High School]], he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1934, where he studied under philosopher [[Irwin Edman]]. Soon thereafter, he became a [[radio]] [[playwright|dramatist]], working in [[David Freedman]]'s "Joke Factory" and later with [[Fred Allen]] for five years then in 1941, for the United States government, writing radio spots to sell [[war bond]]s.  He lived a fairly secular lifestyle in his early 20s before deciding to return to a more traditional Jewish way of life, modeled after his grandfather, in his mid-20s.  From that day to the present, Wouk has commenced each day of his life with a reading of Scripture in Hebrew{{Fact|date=October 2008}}.

Wouk joined the [[United States Navy]] and served in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]],  an experience he later characterized as educational; "I learned about machinery, I learned how men behaved under pressure, and I learned about Americans."  Wouk served as an officer aboard two [[destroyer]] [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s (DMS), the [[USS Zane (DD-337)|USS ''Zane'']] and [[USS Southard|USS ''Southard'']], becoming [[executive officer]] of the latter. He started writing a novel, ''[[Aurora Dawn]]'',<ref>Originally titled by Wouk as ''Aurora Dawn; or, The True history of Andrew Reale, containing a faithful account of the Great Riot, together with the complete texts of Michael Wilde's oration and Father Stanfield's sermon''.</ref> during off-duty hours aboard ship.  Wouk sent a copy of the opening chapters to [[Irwin Edman]] who quoted a few pages verbatim to a New York editor.  The result was a publisher's contract sent to Wouk's ship, then off the coast of [[Okinawa]].  The novel was published in 1947 and became a [[Book of the Month Club]] main selection. His second novel, ''[[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder|City Boy]]'', proved to be a commercial disappointment at the time of its initial publication in 1948; perhaps, as Wouk once claimed, it was swept away by the excitement over [[Norman Mailer]]'s bestselling World War II novel ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.

While writing his next novel, Wouk read each chapter as it was completed to his wife, who remarked at one point that if they didn't like this one, he'd better take up another line of work (a line he would give to the character of the editor Jeannie Fry in his 1962 novel ''[[Youngblood Hawke]]'').  The novel, ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'' (1951), went on to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]].  A huge best-seller, drawing from his wartime experiences aboard minesweepers during World War II, ''The Caine Mutiny'' was adapted by the author into a Broadway play called ''[[The Caine Mutiny Court Martial]]'', and was later made into a film, with Humphrey Bogart portraying Lt. Commander Philip Francis [[Captain Queeg|Queeg]], captain of the fictional DMS ''Caine''.  Some Navy personnel complained at the time that Wouk had taken every twitch of every commanding officer in the Navy and put them all into one character, but Captain Queeg has endured as one of the great characters in American fiction.

He married Betty Sarah Brown in 1945, with whom he had three sons.  He became a fulltime writer in 1946 to support his growing family. His first-born son, Abraham Isaac Wouk, died in a tragic accident as a child; Wouk later dedicated ''[[War and Remembrance]]'' (1978) to him with the Biblical words, "He will destroy death forever."

In 1998, Wouk received the [[Guardian of Zion Award]].  He and his wife currently live in Palm Springs, CA.

==Writing==
His novels after ''The Caine Mutiny'' include ''[[Marjorie Morningstar (novel)|Marjorie Morningstar]]'' (1955), ''[[Youngblood Hawke]]'' (1962), and ''[[Don't Stop the Carnival]]'' (1965).  In 1956 he published in [[paperback]] the novel ''[[Slattery's Hurricane]]'', which he had written in 1948 as the basis for the screenplay for the film of the same name. Wouk's first work of non-fiction was 1959's ''[[This is My God: The Jewish Way of Life|This is My God]]'', an 
explanation of [[Orthodox Judaism]].  

In the 1970s, Wouk published his two most ambitious novels, ''[[The Winds of War]]'' (1971) and ''[[War and Remembrance]]'' (1978).  He described the latter, which included a devastating depiction of the Holocaust, as "the main tale I have to tell."  Both were made into hugely popular TV miniseries.  Although they were made several years apart, both were directed by [[Dan Curtis]] and both starred [[Robert Mitchum]] as Captain Victor "Pug" Henry, the main character.  

The novels are ingeniously constructed [[historical fiction]], so absorbing that [[Henry Kissinger]] called them at one point "the war itself."  Each has three layers:  the story told from the viewpoint of Captain Henry; a more or less straightforward historical account of the events of the war; and, most ingeniously, an analysis by a member of Hitler's military staff, the insightful General Armin von Roon, who would have been a major figure in world history, had he existed.  There are many classic accounts in the novels, but perhaps most interesting are the bombing raid on Germany by British airmen before Pearl Harbor (Captain Henry joins them for a look see), in the first novel, and the Battle of Midway, in the second.  The latter contains what one reviewer called a "remarkable roster call of American airmen sacrificed during the battle."

Wouk hired highly qualified young historians to assist him with the research for his later historical novels, and their details are highly accurate. They include putting together the "roster call" of Midway.  Experts have described ''The Caine Mutiny'' as one of the best depictions of daily life aboard a US ship during the Second World War.

'''Wouk on Zionism'''
*"Zionism is a single long action of lifesaving, of snatching great masses of people out of the path of sure extinction." (''This is My God,'' first edition (1959), page 264.)

== Library of Congress ==
Wouk has kept a personal diary since the 1930s. On September 10, 2008, Wouk formally presented the Library of Congress with his journals, now numbering over 90 volumes, in a ceremony which honored him with the first Library of Congress Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Writing of Fiction.

Wouk often refers to his journals to check dates and facts in his writing, and was hesitant to let the originals out of his personal possession. A solution was arrived at: a scanning service bureau was selected to scan the entire set of volumes into digital formats.<ref>[http://www.twinimaging.com/latestnews.html Twin Imaging Technology preserves personal journals for Pulitzer Prize author, Herman Wouk].</ref>
