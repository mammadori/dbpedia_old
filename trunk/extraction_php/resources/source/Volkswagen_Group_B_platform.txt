{{TOC right}}The '''Volkswagen Group B platform''' is a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[automobile platform]] from the [[Volkswagen Group]].  It has been used for [[sedan (automobile)|saloon cars/sedans]], [[station wagon|estate cars/station wagon]], and [[coupé]]s - under the [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Passenger Cars]], [[Audi]], [[SEAT]] and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] [[marque]]s over the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Volkswagen Dasher, Quantum and Passat - Generations|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=105651|work=Edmunds Inc.|publisher=Edmunds.com - Inside Line|date=01-02-2003|accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref> {{failed verification|date=October 2009}}{{request quotation|date=October 2009}}

Volkswagen Group now uses a revised platform naming system. Under this system, a platform code is composed as follows:

#The 1st character - a letter, '''P''': indicating a ''passenger car'' platform
#The 2nd character - a letter: indicating the ''orientation'' of the [[internal combustion engine|engine]]: '''Q''' indicates a ''[[transverse engine]]'' (''Quer'' in German), or '''L''' indicates a ''[[longitudinal engine]]'' (''Längs'' in German)
#The 3rd character - a digit: indicating the ''size'' or ''class'' of platform (and therefore also the car)
#The 4th character - a digit: indicating the ''generation'' or ''evolution''
#The 5th character - an optional sign, '''+''': indicating an extended or long-[[wheelbase]] version

==B1==
1974-1988.  An [[Audi]] derived platform, the first [[Volkswagen Passat|Volkswagen Passat]] was nearly identical to the [[Audi 80]] (Audi Fox in US), sharing much of its mechanical systems, including its [[longitudinal engine]] placement.

*[[Volkswagen Passat#B1|VW Passat B1]] / [[Volkswagen Passat|VW Dasher]] (''Typ'' 32, 1974-1981; 1975-1988 in Brazil)
*[[Audi 80]] (''Typ'' 80, 1973–1976)
*[[Audi 80]] (''Typ'' 82, 1977–1978)

==BX==
1980-1993.  The BX platform, developed Volkwagen's [[Brazil]]ian subsidiary ([[Volkswagen do Brasil]]), again borrowed heavily from the Audi 80 (Fox/4000) of the day.  The BX platform was used for the Brazilian [[Volkswagen Gol]], Voyage (Gacel or Senda - In Argentina, and Fox in the U.S.), Parati (Amazon in U.S.), Saveiro (pickup) and Furgão (van) models.  The Gol/Fox was quite unique in that it started life with a four-cylinder [[Volkswagen air cooled engine]] (borrowed from the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]), and eventually ended up with a more modern watercooled engine, being sold in the US for the first time as a 1987 model.  The VW BX family was restyled in 1987 and 1991.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a VW Fox?|url=http://www.lunaticfringe.org/vwfox/fox.html|work=Adam's Volkswagen Fox web pages|publisher=LunaticFringe.org|date= |accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref>

==B2==
Still an Audi derived platform, this time based on the Audi 80/4000, again, including its [[longitudinal engine]] placement and, on some European models, the [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] [[four-wheel drive]] system, rebranded [[Syncro]] for Volkswagen cars.  The Santana (facelifted) is still produced to this day in some countries, as is the [[Volkswagen Gol]].

*[[Volkswagen Passat#B2|Volkswagen Passat B2]] (''Typ'' 32B, 1981-1988; 1982-1988 in the US where it was sold as the Quantum)
*[[Audi 80#B2|Audi 80]] and [[Audi 90|90]] (''Typ'' 81, 1979–1987)
*[[Audi 4000CS quattro]] (''Typ'' 85, 1984–1987)
*[[Audi Coupé]] (''Typ'' 85, 1981–1987)
*[[Audi Quattro]] (''Typ'' 85, 1981–1991)
*[[Audi Quattro#Sport|Audi Sport Quattro]] (1984–1987)
*[[Volkswagen Gol]] generation 2 to generation 4 (1994-present)
*[[Volkswagen Santana]] (1984-2006)

==B3==
The B3 Volkswagen Passat was the first B platform car to be called Passat in the United States.  The B3 was also the first Passat with an independently designed platform, it did not share parts with [[Audi]] models.  Instead, the design borrowed heavily from the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A2|Volkswagen Group A2 platform]].

*[[Volkswagen Passat#B3|Volkswagen Passat B3]] (''Typ'' 35i, 1988-1993; 1990-1994 in US)
*[[Volkswagen Corrado]] (1988-1995, hybrid platform with A2)

The "B3" designation is also used to refer to the "''Typ'' 89" version of the [[Audi 80|Audi 80/90]] produced from 1987 to 1992 and the "''Typ'' 8B" [[Audi Coupé]] and [[Audi S2|S2]].  However these are ''not'' based on the same platform as the "B3" Passat.

==B4==
The B4 Passat was a face lifted B3 (receiving its own generation number is controversial), remaining nearly mechanically identical, but with entirely new sheetmetal, and an updated interior design.

*[[Volkswagen Passat#B4|Volkswagen Passat B4]] (''Typ'' 35i, 1993-1996; U.S. 1995-1997)

The "B4" designation is also used to refer to the "''Typ'' 8C" version of the Audi 80 and [[Audi RS2|RS2]] produced from 1991 to 1994.  However these are ''not'' based on the same platform as the "B4" Passat.

==B5 (PL45){{anchor|B5}}==
The B5 platform employs a [[longitudinal engine]] placement, which differs from the [[Volkswagen Group A platform]] which have been traditionally [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]].  This platform (also known as '''PL45''') was introduced with the first-generation [[Audi A4]] and the 1996 Volkswagen Passat.  B5 platform cars  can be equipped with a [[multilink suspension|multilink front suspension]] and a [[Torsen]] centre differential for [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] or [[4motion]] branded [[four-wheel drive]] systems.  A long-[[wheelbase]] derivative of this platform - originally designed for the Chinese market and being used in the 1999 Volkswagen Passat Lingyu, but ultimately being used for its rebadged version under the Škoda brand, the 2002 Škoda Superb - is referred to as '''PL45+'''.

In 2001, the B5 Passat received a facelift, referred to as "B5.5".

==B6{{anchor|B6}}==
The designation "B6" is used to identify the "''Typ'' 8E" Audi A4/S4 produced from late 2000 to 2005.  The platform used by these models is formally known as the '''PL46''' platform.

Confusingly, the current generations of Volkswagen's [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] are also [[colloquialism|colloquially]] referred to as "B6", given that they are Volkswagen's sixth generation mid-sized saloon.  However this generation of the Passat uses the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|PQ46]] platform for its sixth generation, a slightly enlarged version of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf Mk5]] and [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta Mk5]]'s PQ35 platform.

==B7{{anchor|B7}}==
The Audi A4, S4 and RS4 has a "B7" generation, from 2005 to 2008.  However, this seventh generation of the car was a minor revision of the PL46 platform, but with major revisions to [[internal combustion engine|engine]] ranges, [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] revisions, updated chassis and consumer electronics, and restyled [[bodywork]].  The B7 A4/S4 retains the ''Typ'' 8E/8H numbers  of the B6 A4/S4, though with different suffixes.

*[[SEAT Exeo]] (derived from B7 Audi A4) (2009-)

==MLB/MLP (B8){{anchors|B8|MLB|MLP}}==
The '''MLB''' (''Modularer Längsbaukasten'' {{de icon}}) or '''[[Audi MLP]]''' (Modular Longitudinal Platform), sometimes referred to as the '''B8''' platform, is noteworthy for placing the front [[differential (mechanics)|differential]] ahead of the [[clutch]], allowing the front [[axle]] to be moved forward 4 inches.  This causes an increase in [[wheelbase]] and a slightly more rearward weight distribution for better [[vehicle dynamics]].

*[[Audi A5]] (''Typ'' 8T, 2007-)
*[[Audi A4]] (''Typ'' 8K, 2008-)
*[[Audi Q5]] (''Typ'' 8R, 2009-)
