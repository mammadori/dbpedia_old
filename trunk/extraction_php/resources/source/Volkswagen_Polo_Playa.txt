The '''Volkswagen Polo Playa''' is a [[supermini car|supermini]] produced and sold in [[South Africa]]. From 1996 until 2002, it was a rebadged version of the [[SEAT Ibiza]] Mk2 five-door [[hatchback]].  A separate model, the [[Volkswagen Polo Mk3|Polo Mk3]] was sold in most markets during this period - this model shared its mechanical components with the Ibiza and Playa, but in hatchback form the body panels were all different.
