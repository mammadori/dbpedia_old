The '''Porsche Panamera''' (Type number '''970''') is a four-[[vehicle door|door]], four-[[car seat|seat]] [[luxury vehicle|luxury]] [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]], which was launched in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Porsche Panamera - Car News|publisher=[[Car and Driver]]|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/carnews/13377/2010-porsche-panamera.html|month=July|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>  It is [[front-engine design|front-engined]] with [[rear-wheel drive]], with a [[four-wheel drive]] version also available.

The Porsche Panamera production model was unveiled at the 13th Auto Shanghai International Automobile Show in Shanghai, China on April 2009.<ref name="2010 Porsche Panamera: 20 New Photos">{{cite web|title=2010 Porsche Panamera: 20 New Photos|publisher=Left Lane|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/porsche-panamera.html|date=2008-11-25|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref>

==Production==
Engines are first assembled in [[Stuttgart]], and the car's [[bodywork|body]] is built and painted at the [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|Volkswagen Group facility]] in [[Hannover]].  The final assembly of the vehicle takes place in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], alongside the [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Future: Porsche Panamera|publisher=[[Motor Trend]]|url=http://www.motortrend.com/future/concept_cars/112_0510_2010_porsche_panamera|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>

The Panamera is generally considered to be the long-awaited fruit of Porsche's [[Porsche 989|989]] [[concept vehicle|concept]] from the late 1980s; some argue that it also presents itself as a successor to the two-door [[Porsche 928|928]], but there may be plans to develop a new 928 as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 Porsche 928 Car news|work=[[Car and Driver]]|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/carnews/11785/2012-porsche-928.html|month=November | year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>

The Porsche Panamera is marketed as a direct competitor to automobiles such as the [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class|Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG]], [[Aston Martin Rapide]], and [[Maserati Quattroporte]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  The Panamera may also be considered as a less expensive alternative to vehicles such as the [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur]] and the [[Mercedes S63 AMG|Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Production began in April 2009, one month after its debut in the [[Auto Shanghai|Shanghai Motor Show]] in China.  Porsche will keep production rate at around 20,000 cars per year.<ref name="First official image of Porsche Panamera">[http://www.motorauthority.com/porsche-panamera-to-start-production-in-april-2009.html Porsche Panamera official details]</ref>

==Etymology==
The Panamera's name is derived, like the [[Porsche Carrera]] line, from the [[Carrera Panamericana]] race.  Earlier prototypes of four-door saloons, such as the 1991 [[Porsche 989]] prototype and the four-door 911 based prototype, never went into production.

==Publicity==
On the 20 April 2007, a spy video of the Porsche Panamera became available on the Internet.<ref>[http://www.caradvice.com.au/2280/porsche-panamera-spy-video/ Porsche Panamera Spy Video]</ref>

In September 2008, Porsche released the first teaser image for the Panamera.<ref>[http://www.porsche.com/panamera Panamera] at porsche.com</ref> In early October 2008, an undisguised Panamera was captured on film in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]].<ref>[http://www.ausmotive.com/2008/10/16/porsche-panamera-makes-korea-move.html Porsche Panamera makes Korea move]</ref>

In November 2008, the first official image of the Panamera was leaked.<ref name="First official image of Porsche Panamera" />

On 28 November 2008, Porsche sent a mailer containing two photos of the Panamera which were labeled as "the first official images of the Porsche Panamera" with an invitation to have online access to via Porsche USA's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.porscheusa.com/4uncompromised |title=Welcome to the Family &#124; Porsche Panamera |publisher=Porscheusa.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref>

The 30 November 2008 edition of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' featured a look at the Panamera in its news section, with the three presenters critically comparing its looks to those of the [[Austin Maxi]].  On 21 May 2009 Richard Hammond and James May from ''Top Gear'' were seen driving the Panamera along the A30 in Devon.  They were racing against a letter sent via [[Royal Mail]] between the [[Isles of Scilly]] and the [[Orkney Islands]].  This episode was broadcast on the [[BBC]] on 12 July 2009.

On 19 April 2009, Porsche finally unveiled the Porsche Panamera saloon to the public at the 2009 Shanghai Auto Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/04/20/porsche-panamera-debuts-in-shanghai-%e2%80%93-with-videos/|title=Porsche Panamera Debuts In Shanghai – With Videos|publisher=Automoblog.net}}</ref>  One of the highlights of the Panamera's debut was fitting the car in the freight elevator of the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]] and sending it to the skyscraper's 94th floor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/how-to-fit-a-porsche-panamera-into-an-elevator.html|title=How to Fit a Porsche Panamera into an Elevator|publisher=Left Lane News|date=2009-04-21|accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref>
