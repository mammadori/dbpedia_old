The '''Apollo''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[automobile]] manufactured by [[Ruppe & Son]] of [[Apolda]] in [[Thuringia]] from 1910 to 1927; the company had previously offered a car called the [[Piccolo (automobile)|Piccolo]].  The first Apollo was called the "Mobbel", and featured an [[air-cooled]] 624[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] single-cylinder [[ioe]] engine.  The company also offered air-cooled 1608 cc [[in-line]] fours and a 1575 cc [[V4 engine|V-4]].  Four separate [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s inline powered the model "E" (1770cc).  The model "B", designed by racing driver [[Karl Slevogt]], had an [[ohv]] 960 cc four-cylinder engine.  Another of the designer's fine creations had an ohv 2040 cc engine.  Other Apollos had [[sv]] four-cylinder engines of up to 3440 cc; some post-1920 models featured [[wishbone suspension]].  The last cars produced by the company had ohv 1200 cc four-cylinder engines; some had sv 1551 [[Steudel]] four-cylinder power units instead.  The famous designer of [[two-stroke engine]]s, [[Hugo Ruppe]], was the factory founder's son; in 1920 Apollo took over his air-cooled [[MAF]] cars.  During the mid-1920s, Slevogt raced cars of this marque with streamlined [[Jaray]] bodies.
