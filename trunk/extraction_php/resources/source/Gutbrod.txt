'''Gutbrod''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[automobile|car]] [[manufacturer]].  The firm was founded by [[:de:Wilhelm Gutbrod|Wilhelm Gutbrod]] in 1926.  It originally built [[motorcycle]]s, and from 1933 to 1935, [[Standard Superior]] cars were built with [[rear-engine design|rear-mounted engine]]s.

The small '''Gutbrod Superior''' model was produced from 1950 to 1954 using the company's own, [[Front-engine design|front-mounted]] twin-cylinder [[two-stroke engine]]s initially of 593cc.   In April 1953 the engine size was increased to 663 cc for more expensive 'Luxus 700' versions of the car, while the standard model continued to be offered with the original smaller engine.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1973>{{cite journal| authorlink = | title = Vor 20 Jahren: Test Gutbrod Superior (ie a page of extracts from the same magazine's edition of exactly twenty years earlier | journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

7726 cars were produced before the factory was forced to close.  The car was developed at the company's small factory at [[Plochingen|Plochingen am Neckar]]<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197619>{{cite journal| authorlink = CBP (Ferdinand Simoneit - Ed)| title = Errinern Sie Sich?

Scherenberg arrived at Gutbrod from [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], and later would return to that firm.

A Gutbrod injection engine can still be seen in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]].

It was a small two seater car, the overall length was {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, width {{convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the total weight {{convert|650|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, max speed {{convert|90|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.  The car was offered as standard version for a price of [[German mark|DM]] 3990, and as Superior Luxus for DM 4380.  Recently, a restoration project of an injection model was sold in [[Geneva]] for [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 3000.

In 1956, [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Troll (automobile)|Troll]] cars were equipped with Gutbrod engines.
