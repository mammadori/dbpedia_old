The '''BMW E30''' is [[compact car|compact executive car]] produced by BMW. It was the successor of the [[BMW E21]] in 1982 and was replaced by the [[BMW E36]] in 1990.  [[BMW]] continued to produce the cabriolet ([[convertible]]) E30 well into 1993. The Touring remained in production until 1994 when the E36 touring replaced it. The M3 cabriolet was never officially offered for sale in [[North America]]; it was offered only for the [[Europe]]an market.

The [[BMW M3]] was first introduced on the E30 platform. A widened version of the E30 front suspension and the drivetrain from the E30 325i were used in the [[BMW Z1]] [[roadster]].

The E30 3-Series was produced in four body styles, a four door saloon, a two door saloon, a five door [[Station wagon|estate]] (marketed as the "touring"), and a two door convertible. A [[Karosserie Baur|Baur]] cabrio was also available. The 325ix was produced from 1985 to 1991, and featured all-wheel drive. It was available as a two-door (saloon) or a four-door ([[sedan (car)|sedan]]) and as touring. The [[BMW M3]] utilised a widened and heavily redesigned and restyled variation of the 2 door body style. The M3 shares few parts with other E30 models.

The primary distinctive feature of the BMW E30 models produced for the North American market in 1984-1987 are the elongated front/rear aluminum bumpers. These bumpers are commonly known as "diving boards."  In 1988, the anodized aluminum bumpers were shortened by revising the cover/fillers and shortening the shocks.  In 1989 the aluminum bumpers were replaced with shorter body-color plastic bumpers.

The cars were powered by a range of [[Straight-4|inline 4 cylinder]] ([[BMW M10]] , [[BMW M40]] , & [[BMW M42]]) and [[Straight-6|inline 6 cylinder]] ([[BMW M20]] and [[BMW M21]]) engines, with both petrol and diesel power. Torque output for the engines ranges from {{convert|140|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} [[torque]] for the 1.8&nbsp;[[Liter|L]] (1766&nbsp;cc) 4 cylinder engine, to {{convert|230|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} torque from the 2.7&nbsp;L (2693&nbsp;cc) 6 cylinder petrol engine.  The E30 [[BMW M3]] was fitted with a high-revving 4-cylinder engine ([[BMW S14]]) which produced {{convert|235|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in its final European-only iteration.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

==Engines==
Following on from the [[BMW E21|E21]], the E30 was fitted with [[BMW M10|M10]] [[straight-4 engine|straight-4]] and [[BMW M20|M20]] [[straight-6]] engines.
The 316 used a 1766 [[cubic centimetre|cc]] M10 fed by a [[carburettor]] and producing only {{convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, but this allowed BMW to offer a cheap, entry-level car in the range. The 318i had the same M10 engine, but with [[Jetronic]] [[fuel injection]], pushing power to {{convert|105|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and improving [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. Finally, the 320i (2.0 [[litre|L]] M20 with {{convert|125|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}) and 323i (2.3 L M20 with {{convert|143|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}) completed the range.  Later, in 1985, a 2.5&nbsp;L version of the M20 boosted the power of the top model to {{convert|170|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, replacing the old 323i.

Europe and [[North America]] received an economy version called the 325e (the e stands for the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[eta (letter)|eta]], signifying economy). Strangely enough, the engine was the largest available in the chassis, aside from the rare [[South Africa]]n version which was available with the 3.3&nbsp;L [[BMW M30|M30]]. The 2.7&nbsp;L had a longer [[piston stroke|stroke]] than the 2.5&nbsp;L, with a more restrictive head, four cam bearings instead of seven (less internal friction), and softer valve springs. This resulted in {{convert|121|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.
In 1987, the E30 was revised.  The revision contained two significant changes in the engine department. First, the M20 straight-6 engines changed from Bosch Jetronic to Bosch Motronic. This boosted the 320i to {{convert|129|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and the 325i to {{convert|171|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, all the while improving the economy. The M10 was replaced by the new, belt-driven cam [[BMW M40|M40]] which also incorporated Motronic injection. The new 318i now had {{convert|115|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and was noticeably smoother than the old version.
A new engine had been developed, a chain-driven cam 4 cylinder [[BMW M42|M42]] 1.8&nbsp;L DOHC 16 V engine creating the 318is in 1989. This is the most modern engine built to the E30 (this engine has been later used in early 318i E36s).

The 316 was replaced by a 316i, which used a 1600&nbsp;cc version of the M40, producing {{convert|102|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Not quite as torquey as the {{convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1766&nbsp;cc M10 it replaced, it nevertheless offered superior performance.
In some markets, like South Africa, the old M10-powered 316 continued a lot longer, gaining the new bumpers of the other models. In South Africa, The 316i was released in 1991.

==Drivetrain==

In total, seven transmission were available for the various models of the E30: four [[manual transmission|manuals]], and three [[automatic transmission|automatics]].

A 4-speed manual was available for the 316 and 318i. The 316, 318i, and 320i also had the option of a common 5-speed manual, while the 323i and 325i had a different manual, and in addition, the 323i had a sports manual as an option. The transmissions for the 316 and 318i featured [[synchromesh]] on forward gears only, while the 320i and 323i, both with standard and sports transmissions, had synchromesh on reverse as well.

Both automatic transmissions were manufactured by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] - they were the 3-speed [[ZF 3HP22 transmission|3 HP 22]], which was available on the 316 and 318i models, and the 4-speed [[ZF 4HP22 transmission|4 HP 22]], which was available on the 320i, 323i, 324td, 325, 325i and 325e models.

There were many [[differential (mechanics)|differentials]] used on the E30 models. The 316 and 318i shared a differential, as did the 320i and 323i, with the standard transmission. 323i models with sports transmissions had a different differential. The 325i received its own ratio, as did the 325e. The various M3s had special ratios as well.

The all-wheel drive system on the iX models used three differentials to distribute power to the wheels, 37:63 split front to rear. The center and rear differentials use viscous couplings to split torque. The front differential was open.

==Special models==

In addition to the famous M3 there were other special models of the E30. For Portugal and Italy, due to their high engine taxes, a special model was created, the 320iS. This model was produced both in 2 and 4 door versions had a detuned version of the M3 engine. It was the same S14 engine but with 2.0l and {{convert|192|hp|abbr=on}}. 
BMW South Africa's Motorsport division created the 333i in 1986 by fitting the 3210 ccm  M30 "big six" ("M30B32" of the 733i E23/ 533i E12/ 533i E28/ 633CSi E24) engine to a 2-door E30. The resulting 333i was a major success in saloon car racing in that country and is now a collectors item. These cars, built with help from Alpina in Buchloe, Bavaria, Germany, featured some interesting compromises like forcing the buyer to choose between air conditioning (vital in South Africa) or power steering (because of lack of space due to the large M30 engine). They were only built in small numbers in 1986. BMW South Africa provided the following specifications for the 333i: Powerplant - M30B32 6 Cylinder 3210 cc {{convert|145|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm. {{convert|285|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} torque at 4300 rpm. The cars were fitted with a 5 speed manual gearbox and limited slip differential. Braking was enhanced by {{convert|296|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} Alpina dual ventilated grooved front disc brakes. ABS was optional. The cars were fitted with J7x16 Alpina wheels and Pirelli P7 (195x50VR16)tyres. BMW provided performance figures were impressive, with a top speed of {{convert|228|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. 0-100&nbsp;km/h in 7.4 seconds, and a standing kilometer in 27.7 seconds at sea level. An all round "Rocket Rocket."

Later when it became clear that South Africa would not be getting the M3, the 325iS was created. Initially this was merely a 325i 2-door fitted with a bodykit and a close-ratio gearbox (improving acceleration at the expense of top speed and economy), but more changes were made to keep the car competitive in South African saloon car racing. Nevertheless, these cars were always sold to the public. This culminated in the 325iS Evo II of late 1991. By now several body panels were made of aluminum, preventing the car from being washed by automated car washes, and the M20 engine grew to 2.7 L and now produced 155&nbsp;kW (210&nbsp;hp)and a 0-62 mph in a mere 7.5 seconds.

The cabriolet version continued to be built to the end of April 1993 and the touring version continued to be built to the end of February 1994.

==Suspension==
One of the features that resulted in the relatively light curb weight and roominess of the E30 was the suspension. The front MacPherson struts and rear semi-trailing arms were a compact arrangement that left a lot of cabin and trunk space for the car's overall size. The semi-trailing arms  have been criticized for the dynamic toe & camber changes inherent to the suspension geometry, causing bump steer in hard cornering situations (such as racing and autocross).

==Service indicator==

The E30 was the first 3-Series car to be fitted with an onboard service indicator, comprised of an [[LED]] bargraph plus Inspection and Oil Service warning lights.
