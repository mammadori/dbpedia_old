'''Brabus''', founded 1977 in [[Bottrop]] ([[Ruhr Area]]), [[Germany]] by Klaus ''Bra''ckmann and Bodo ''Bus''chmann, is a high-performance aftermarket [[Car tuning|tuning]] company which specializes in [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Smart (automobile)|Smart]] and [[Maybach]] vehicles.

Owned by Bodo Buschmann, Brabus has since become the largest Mercedes tuner, other than [[Mercedes-AMG]] who became a [[DaimlerChrysler]] affiliate in the 1990s. Its competitors include [[Lorinser]], [[Carlsson (car company)|Carlsson]], [[Kleemann]], and [[Renntech]].  

Brabus's primary focus is to achieve maximum engine performance through the increase of both horsepower and [[torque]]. Customers can either buy cars straight from Brabus or send in their Mercedes to be customized and/or overhauled. If a customer orders a car from Brabus, Brabus buys the particular car from Mercedes and then modifies it in-house according to the customer's requests. Brabus is known for providing very expensive tuning and custom solutions, making an "if you have to ask the price, you can't afford it" scenario.

Brabus offers simple upgrades such as low profile spoilers, bodykits, [[carbon fiber]] splitters, and multi-piece alloy wheels. More serious upgrades include racing [[limited slip differential|LSDs]], open racing exhaust systems, twelve-piston disc brakes, and engine remapping. However, most customers pay for complete engine overhauls for which Brabus has become famous. The company typically orders crate engines from [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] and completely redesigns them.

Brabus engines range from small {{convert|200|hp}} K4 blocks for [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class|SLK roadsters]] and [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class|CLK-Class]] to {{convert|730|hp}} [[twin-turbo]] blocks for the [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class|CL-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class|CLS-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|G-Class]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Feb09/19_001596_Geneva_Motor_Show_With_Preview_The_BRABUS_G_V12_S_Biturbo_Mercedes_Benz_G_Class.html |title=Geneva Motor Show Preview: The BRABUS G V12 S Biturbo Mercedes-Benz G-Class &#124; eMercedesBenz - The Unofficial Mercedes-Benz Weblog |publisher=eMercedesBenz |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref>  and [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]]. The company also provides improvements to the interior from custom upholstery, gauges, shiftknobs, pedals, and trim to various electronics such as wider [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens for the [[Maybach]]. 

The BRABUS K8 performance kit for the top-of-the-line SL model (SL55) comprises modifications to the supercharger drive in the form of a custom vibration damper and a new pulley for improved belt- drive geometry, high-performance metal catalysts, and an auxiliary circulation pump with opposing radiator. The power developed by the modified supercharged engine, like the five-speed automatic transmission and the rear differential lubricated exclusively with ARAL high-performance lubricants, is nothing short of exceptional: Instead of standard {{convert|476|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} the engine now develops {{convert|550|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,200 rpm. Even more gigantic is the maximum torque of {{convert|780|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} torque at just 3,000 rpm. After the power treatment the roadster races to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} just 4.1 seconds, passes {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} after exactly 13.6 seconds and reaches an electronically limited top speed {{convert|186|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} with the limiter removed top speed would be well over {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.
