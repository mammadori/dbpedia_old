'''Standard Superior''' was an [[automobile]] [[marque]], used from 1933-1935 by ''Standard Fahrzeugfabrik'' of [[Germany]], founded by [[Wilhelm Gutbrod]].  These small cars were designed according to the patents by [[Josef Ganz]] and featured rear-mounted [[two-stroke engine]]s.

After [[World War II]], the same company made [[Gutbrod]] cars and introduced the model [[Gutbrod Superior]].

==History==
In the first half of 1932, Wilhelm Gutbrod, the President of the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik, came into contact with German engineer Josef Ganz. Ganz had been working on a small [[Volkswagen]] car design since the early 1920s and had so far built two prototypes, one for [[Ardie]] in 1930 and one for [[Adler (automobile)|Adler]] in 1931, called the [[Maikäfer]] ([[May Beetle]]). After a demonstration with the Maikäfer by Ganz, Gutbrod was most interested to build a small car according to this design. The Standard Fahrzeugfabrik then purchased a license from Ganz to develop and build a small car according to his design. The prototype of this new model, which was to be called Standard Superior, was finished in 1932. It featured a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and [[Independent suspension|independent wheel suspension]] with [[Swing axle|swing-axles]] at the rear. 

==Models==

The first production model of the Standard Superior was introduced at the IAMA (Internationale Automobil- und Motorradausstellung) in Berlin in February 1933. Because of some criticism to the body design, not in the least by Josef Ganz in [[Motor-Kritik]], it was followed in April 1933 by a slightly altered model.

In November 1933 the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik introduced yet another new and improved model for 1934, which was slightly longer with one additional window on each side and had a small seat for children or as luggage space in the back. This car was advertised as the German Volkswagen.

==The Volkswagen Beetle connection==
With the Ardie-Ganz, [[Adler]] Maikäfer and Standard Superior cars, as well as his progressive writings and promotion of the concept of a Volkswagen in Motor-Kritik magazine since the 1920s, Josef Ganz is claimed by some to be the inspiration behind the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].{{ref|netwerk}} These cars had all the then novel features of the later Volkswagen Beetle, such as the tubular chassis, rear-mounted engine and independent wheel suspension with swing axles.

According to the report, as a [[Jew]], Ganz was deprived of his patent rights, which were later illegally passed to [[Tatra]], whose management had impeccable [[Gestapo]] connections.  Ganz himself, after an odyssey of escaping through numerous [[Europe]]an countries, had landed in [[Australia]].  The name Volkswagen was stolen by [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Hermann Göring]] who saw Ganz's VW [[prototype]] at an exhibition.{{note|jalopnik}}

==New investigation==
While the Volkswagen Beetle was produced in its millions after World War Two, the name of Josef Ganz was largely forgotten. In 2004, Dutch journalist [[Paul Schilperoord]] started researching the life and work of Josef Ganz. He has unearthed many new facts and is currently working on a new book and documentary.
