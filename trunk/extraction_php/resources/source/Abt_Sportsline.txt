'''Abt Sportsline''' is a [[motor racing]] and  auto tuning company based in [[Kempten im Allgäu]], [[Germany]]. Abt mainly deals with [[Audi]], and the related primary [[Volkswagen Group]] brands - [[Volkswagen]], [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]], and [[SEAT]].

==History==
Johann Abt (born December 1935), who continued a horseshoeing tradition of his family with motor cars, was a motorcycling and [[hillclimbing]] racer for [[Abarth]] factory team until 1970.  He later entered cars with his own team, winning the "Trophée de l’Avenir“ and other series.

Since the death of their father Johann in 2003, the company with 100 employees has been run by the brothers Hans-Jürgen Abt (born 1962, Managing Director) and [[Christian Abt]] who is also a race car driver.

After Christian Abt won the German STW [[Supertouring]] championship title in 1999 with an [[Audi A4]], a quick decision was made to join the new [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]].  The new Abt-[[Audi TT]]-R initially showed their lack of development time, but in 2002 the team celebrated the biggest success in the company’s history with [[Laurent Aïello]]’s title in the DTM.

In the 2003 DTM season, Abt Sportsline gave their 19-year-old apprentice [[Peter Terting]] the opportunity to drive one of their {{Convert|470|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} cars, after the [[rookie]] had won the [[ADAC]] [[Volkswagen Lupo|VW Lupo]] Cup series title in 2002.  The young man could not really cope with the pressure in the professional competitions, though, but the move by Abt is remarkable anyway.

==Aftermarket==
Abt has taken much of their racing knowledge and adapted it for the street, making the company a successful tuner for the full [[Volkswagen Group]] line of products (including Audi and SEAT).

==Notable cars==
* '''AS4-R''' - A highly modified B7 [[Audi A4|A4]] Avant, the ASR-R makes use of the [[Twin-turbo|bi-turbo]] 2.7L [[V6 engine|V6]] to produce {{Convert|480|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6800 rpm, and {{convert|417|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque at 3300 rpm!  [[Modified Luxury & Exotics]] magazine called the AS4-R, "a grocery getter that delivers," and said it, "handles like a toy..." <ref>''Modified Luxury & Exotics'' RS4 Renaissance, PP. 88 to 94, By Colum Wood.

* '''TT-R''' - A supercharged second generation V6 [[Audi TT]].
* '''R8-R''' - Not yet released ABT's [[Audi R8|R8]] will feature a [[supercharger]] mated to Audi's incredible 4.2L [[V8 engine|V8]] for a total horsepower output of {{Convert|530|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.
