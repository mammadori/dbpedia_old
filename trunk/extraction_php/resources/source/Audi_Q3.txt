The '''Audi Q3''' is an [[automobile]] manufactured by [[Audi|Audi AG]] of [[Germany]] that is expected to debut commercially in 2011.  The five-door coupe [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] will be aimed as more of a lifestyle/sports car, rather than for the family/off-road market its larger [[Audi Q5|Q5]] & [[Audi Q7|Q7]] siblings aim for.  The Q3 will slot above the proposed [[Audi Q1]]. The car will use the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5]], the same as the [[Volkswagen Tiguan]]/[[SEAT Tribu]] small SUVs.  It will join the similarly-sized but competitive [[BMW X1]] in the same model year for launch, and will be similar to the 2009-10 launch of the [[Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class]] and [[Audi Q5]] during the same model year.

The car will combine a [[transverse engine]] layout with flexible steering and suspension offers.  The Q3 will borrow many [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf Mk5]], or possibly Golf Mk6, components, such as a [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG) [[dual clutch transmission]] and a {{convert|147|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} 2.0 FSI turbo engine featured in the current Golf GTI.  The car should also feature a {{Convert|171|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} 3.0 turbo-diesel V6 & a {{Convert|210|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} 3.6 FSI V6 for the flagship, the Q3S.

While the car should be available in both [[front-wheel drive]] (FWD), and [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] "on-demand" [[four-wheel drive]] variants, there will be no height-adjustable suspension, lockable differentials or low-range gearing.  Instead, the car will feature larger wheels and a sports suspension.
 
The car has been approved due to the declining sales large SUVs are currently experiencing, and the public's healthier appetite for smaller [[Crossover (automobile)|crossovers]]. The company is targeting niche markets to reach its ambitious sales targets, and the Q3 is part of these plans. The production name will undergo change from "Q3" to another name as an agreement with carmaker [[Infiniti]] stipulates. Various Audi concept cars have debuted with the name "Cross Coupe" and this name is a possibility for the production Q3.

Audi has announced it will start producing the Q3 in [[Martorell]] (near Barcelona, Spain) in 2011. The plant is owned by [[SEAT]], VW's Spanish subsidiary. <ref>http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKFAB01305120090422</ref><ref>http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090422-703161.html</ref> The decision to produce the Q3 at this plant will give Audi the ability to produce up to 80,000 units per year. The cost of moving to this plant for production will cost approximately â‚¬300 million <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/04/23/audis-new-q3-suv/|title=Audi's New Q3 SUV|publisher=Automoblog.net}}</ref>.
