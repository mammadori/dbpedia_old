The '''Mercedes-Benz C292''' was a stillborn [[Group C]] [[prototype]] race car intended for the [[1992 World Sportscar Championship season]] as an evolution of the [[Mercedes-Benz C291]], but never raced due to [[Mercedes-Benz]] withdrawing from sportscar racing after a dismal 1991 season.

Built by [[Sauber]] for [[Mercedes-Benz]], the C292 featured the same Mercedes-Benz M291 3.5L [[Flat-12]] which had initially disappointed in 1991, but during the offseason continued development and testing and was finally able to produce power similar to [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]], [[Peugeot]], and [[Toyota]].

However, given the large amount of money Mercedes-Benz had invested in sportscar racing since their return, while receiving very little returns even after winning two championships and a [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the decision was made to cancel the project after only a few C292s had been produced by Sauber.  The exact number of C292s that were built is unknown, however one remaining copy is on display in the [[Sauber]] museum.

With the cancellation, the C292 was never tested, and therefore its potential in comparison to its competitors was never able to be seen.  It is unknown if Mercedes even got to the point of installing the M291 engine in the C292.

This would be the last Mercedes-Benz sportscar until the launch of the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR|CLK-GTR]] in 1997.
