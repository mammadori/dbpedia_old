The '''BMW Z Series''' traditionally is a [[roadster]] manufactured by the German automaker [[BMW]] beginning with the [[BMW Z1|Z1]]. Successor to the [[BMW 507]] after nearly 30 years, it has been produced in four different generations, coupe variants, one super car, and one concept. The [[BMW Z1|Z1]] was a limited production European run for [[BMW]], whereas its successor the [[BMW Z3|Z3]] was the first mass produced roadster for [[BMW]]. The original Z in [[BMW Z1|Z1]] stood for ''Zukunft'' ([[German language|German]] for ''future'').

==E30 based Z1, 1989-1992==
{{main|BMW Z1}}
The BMW Z1 is a two-seat roadster developed by [[BMW]] and produced from March 1989 to June 1991<ref>Oswald, op. cit., p. 258. Production was to commence in June, 1988 but was delayed until March 1989.</ref>. The Z1 featured unusual doors which, instead of opening outward or upward, dropped down into the door sills. Only 8,000 examples of the Z1 were produced.

==E36 based Z3, 1996-2002==
{{main|BMW Z3}}
The Z3 was the first modern mass-market [[roadster]] produced by [[BMW]]. The Z3 was introduced as a 1996 model year vehicle, shortly after being featured in the [[James Bond]] movie, ''[[GoldenEye]]''.  There were a few variants of the car before its production run ended in 2002, including a [[coupé]] version for 1999, and M versions for both.  It was manufactured and assembled in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]].

==E85/E86 Z4, 2002-2008==
{{main|BMW Z4}}
The first-generation BMW Z4 was known as the E85 in [[roadster]] form and E86 in [[coupé]] form. It was designed by [[Denmark|Danish]] BMW-designer [[Anders Warming]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofieldguide.com/articles/120201.html|title=Design to Reality: the Z4 Roadster|publisher=AutoFieldGuide}}</ref>.

The Z4's design addresses many criticisms of the preceding [[BMW Z3|Z3]]; the Z4 was larger, and had a significantly stiffer [[chassis]]. It was built in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. Initially, the Z4 was available only as a roadster, but in 2006 a coupé version was officially launched. The last of the first-generation Z4 to be assembled in North America rolled off the assembly line on 27 August 2008.

==E89 Z4, 2009-present==
{{main|BMW Z4}}

==E52 Z8, 2000-2003==
{{Main|BMW Z8}}
The '''BMW Z8''' was a car produced by [[Germany|German]] [[automaker]] [[BMW]] from 2000 to 2003. The Z8 was the production variant of the 1997 Z07 [[concept car]], which was designed by [[Henrik Fisker]] at BMW's [[DesignworksUSA]] in Southern California.  The Z07 originally was designed as a styling exercise intended to evoke and celebrate the 1956-'59 [[BMW 507]].  The Z07 caused a sensation at the '97 Tokyo Auto Show. The overwhelming popularity of the concept spurred BMW's decision to produce a limited production model called the Z8. 5,703 Z8s were built, approximately half of which were exported to the [[United States]].

==Z9 concept==
{{main|BMW Z9}}
The BMW Z9 (or Z9 Gran Turismo, Z9 GT) is a [[concept car|concept]] coupe introduced in 1999 by [[BMW]] at the [[Frankfurt Auto Show]]. During the 2000 [[Paris Auto Show]] a convertible variant of the Z9 was debuted. The Z9 featured a carbon fiber skin over an aluminum space frame.<ref>[http://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/us02.nsf/fwPressemeldungFrame?readform&docid=54F8A378E6605F85C1256BB9002A1355 BMW Press Release: Z9 Gran Turismo Concept Car]</ref> Much of the styling found on the current [[E63|E63 6 series]] is derived from the Z9. The vehicle also featured unique gull wing doors that also opened like a conventional hinged door. The Z9 did not make it into production, but many of its innovations did. The interior included an early concept of [[iDrive|BMW's iDrive system]], called the Intuitive Interaction Concept<ref>[http://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/us02.nsf/fwPressemeldungFrame?readform&docid=7D7A341D17E423BAC1256BB9002A13C7 BMW Press Release: BMW Group at the 2001 North American International Auto Show]</ref>. The Z9 featured the world's first [[V8]] turbo diesel, later produced for the BMW 7 Series 740d model.

==M variations==
The Z3 was the first of the Z series to have a [[BMW M]] sibling with the introduction of the M Coupe and M Roadster vehicles. The first generation [[BMW Z4|Z4]] also continued the M tradition, with the second generation of the M Coupe and M Roadster vehicles. As of March 2009, there has been no official announcements in regards to a third generation for the M Roadster.
