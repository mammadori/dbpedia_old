The '''Porsche GT1''' is the successor to [[Porsche]] [[Porsche Carrera GT|Carrera GT]] rumoured to be released in 2009.<ref>http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/09/porsche-gt1-development-details/</ref> As originally reported by [[Autocar]] the GT1 will feature new technologies as well as previously developed ones for the Porsche Carrera GT. Testing of engines for the GT1 have already begun, although it is unclear whether Porsche will decide to use a modified version of the Carrera GT or Cayenne S' V8 powerplant. It will have an estimated {{convert|950|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and an estimated top speed of {{convert|254|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

The vehicle had been dubbed the '[[Bugatti Veyron|Bugatti Beater]]' by many websites due to the rumour that it would be in direct competition for title of the World's fastest production car. The car was due to be on the production line in October of 2009, but because of the [[Late 2000s recession|current financial crisis]], it has been pushed back to December 2009.
