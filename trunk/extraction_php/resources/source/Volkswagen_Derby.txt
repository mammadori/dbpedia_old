The '''Volkswagen Derby''' is a [[coupe]] version of the [[Volkswagen Polo]] [[supermini car|supermini]], produced by the [[Germany|German]] automaker [[Volkswagen]], between 1977 and 1981.

During 1981, Volkswagen introduced the second generation Polo and the second generation Derby; in 1984 the Derby name was dropped and the saloon version of the Polo became the Polo Classic.

Most parts of the Derby are interchangeable with the Mk1 Polo, and many drivetrain components are compatible with the Mk2 models.  Body parts at the rear and also the rear window are different.  Lights of the early version are the same as the Mk1 Polo and the car which began this design: the [[Audi 50]], which dates to just before the full merger of Audi and Volkswagen.

==Versions available==
In Europe, the Derby was available with 0.9-litre (895 cc), 1.1-litre (1093 cc) and 1.3-litre (1272 cc) [[4-cylinder]] engines, with 40, 50 and 60&nbsp;bhp respectively.  The Derby Formel E ("Formula E"), offered in 1981 only, was an economy-optimised Derby featuring, among other things, a longer ratio gearbox, automatic engine turn-off when idling and a high compression version on the 1100cc engine that demanded super instead of regular petrol. The Formel E concept was also available on other contemporary VW (and Audi) models.

The following versions were available:
* 900 L
* 1100 LS
* 1100 LX
* 1100 CLS
* 1300 LS
* 1300 GL
* 1300 GLS
* 1100 Formel E

In 1980, the Derby underwent a face lift together with the Polo. The restyle attempted to separate the styling of the Polo and the Derby more significantly, which also brought the styling of the Derby in-line with its bigger counterpart: The Volkswagen Jetta. These revisions included square headlamps, a restyled grille and plastic bumpers, together with some interior changes including a new dashboard and instrumentation taken from the Mk1 Golf.

In 1984, the Derby was re-badged as the Polo Classic in Europe, and the Derby's unique square headlamp front end, which had been carried over from the Mk1 was replaced with standard Polo equimpent.

In the UK, the Derby name was dropped with the Mk1, and the Polo Classic name was used from the Mk2's inception. However, early Polo Classics still retained the Derby styling. In turn, the "Classic" branding for the saloon was dropped in 1987 which meant that the Polo and the Derby's integration was complete.

In 1991, the Polo saloon was withdrawn and would not return until 1996, when a version based on a badge engineered SEAT Ibiza/Cordoba platform was launched. This version was known as the VW Derby in Mexico.

==Marketing==
This model was not sold outside of [[Europe]], although some parts of [[Eurasia]] did get the Derby — [[Turkey]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]] were the main export markets within Eurasia, also some parts of [[Eastern Europe]] bordering on Asia had this car.  The name was used on a re-badged [[SEAT Cordoba]] in Mexico (see section below): but marketed as the [[Volkswagen Polo Classic]] saloon in [[Eurasia]].

==South American Polo Classic==
In [[Argentina]] Volkswagen marketed a face-lifted version of the 1999-2001 '''Polo Classic''' which as the '''Derby''' in [[Mexico]] and a [[Volkswagen Caddy]] the [[SEAT Inca]] derived van which shares the same platform and front end styling as the South American Type 6K.

The VW Derby arrived to Mexico in late 1994 as a 95 model and was imported from Europe until the 2001 model year due because the Derby had a strong popularity in the country in the early 2000s the Derby began coming from Argentina because production had already being stopped in Europe at the time and in the 2005 model year was refreshed and was a resemblance of the facelift of the first generation Seat Cordoba but soon after as the competition in that segment grew the Derby began losing sales so bad that in the 2008 model year only 2,987 units were sold when in the early 2000s were sold in the worst years around 10,000 units and part of this was because the car aged very fast and couldn't compete with the other maker also it was always only offered in a 5-speed [[manual transmission]]. Quality was an other issue so VW Mexico decided to stop importing the Derby to Mexico in February 2009 along with the Brazilian made Pointer and the VW Lupo also imported from Brazil. The Derby Van was the same as the Derby only that had two doors and was sold only for fleet use and arrived in 2004; in 2005 received the same facelift as the Derby and also was a poor seller so at the same time the Derby sedan was discontinued VW Mexico decided to drop it, too. In Argentina the Polo classic will survive until the end of 2010 because sales there have been always better than in Mexico.

The 6K Polo Classic and 9K Caddy have been produced since 2000, although saloon versions of the Polo have not been sold in [[Europe]] since 2002.  All face-lifted Type 6K/9K models are built in [[Argentina]].

This model had a 1.8-litre engine, which was exclusive to [[South America]], and not offered on the [[Europe]]an [[Volkswagen Polo]] saloon / estate.
