'''Alpina Burkard Bovensiepen [[GmbH]]''' is an automobile manufacturing company based in [[Buchloe]], in the [[Ostallgäu]] district of [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] selling their own cars, based on [[BMW]] cars.

==History==
Alpina was founded by [[Burkard Bovensiepen]], (b. 1936) who is still the CEO, started in 1965 with the foundation of Burkard Bovensiepen KG at Kaufbeuren in the southern German province of [[Bavaria]]. The original name can be traced to Dr. Rudolf Bovensiepen, his father, whose company's purpose was to make office machinery.

Although Alpina started by producing typewriters, the original Alpina ceased to exist at the end of the 1960s in their attempt to move into the textile industry. In 1965, Burkard established a BMW [[tuning]] business, following his success with investments in the stock market, he started the tuning business in an outbuilding of the original Alpina typewriter factory. The company worked on [[carburetor]]s and revised cylinder heads. By 1970, with seventy employees, the original facility changed locations from Kaufbeuren to Buchloe.

Between 1968 and 1977, Alpina cars did very well in competition. The highlight was in 1970, when the team's cars won the [[European Touring Car Championship]], the German Hillclimb Championship, [[Rallying|rally]] and track racing championships and the prestigious [[Spa 24 Hours]].

==Brand distinctions==
Since the late 1970s Alpina has been recognized by [[TÜV]] as an automobile manufacturer, thus Alpina-built cars are branded and registered as Alpina instead of BMW, although an Alpina can be bought and serviced at local BMW dealerships, and covered if there is a warranty issue. Distinctive features of ALPINA vehicles are 20 spoke alloy wheels, "Alpina Blue" patented metallic paint, in addition to expensive interior materials used to fabricate the exclusive interior appointments. A typical blue and green pattern (same as in the logo) is often used on interior parts such as stitchings on leather and different fabrics used in the upholstery. Also a thin, almost pinstripe like outside body decor set in gold or silver is also a trademark of Alpina cars. A metal plate inside also proves the heritage and the serial number of the car.

Most recently Alpina have produced a version of the current [[BMW E60]] 5-Series called the B5. The B5 offers a different take on performance and how to get it: unlike the [[V10 engine|V10]] M5, the ALPINA B5 uses a [[supercharger|supercharged]] [[V8]] which produces similar power but has far greater [[torque]].
