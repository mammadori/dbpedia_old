'''Irmscher Automobilbau [[GmbH]] & Co. [[Kommanditgesellschaft|KG]]''' is a [[Germany|German]] automobile [[car tuning|tuning]] and [[Manufacturing|manufacturing]] <ref>http://www.irmscher7.de/</ref><ref>http://www.egmcartech.com/2008/02/26/geneva-preview-irmscher-to-debut-473hp-opel-gt-saturn-sky/</ref> company specialising in [[Opel]] (and [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]], both belonging to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]) and recently [[Peugeot]] cars. 
It was founded in 1968 in a double garage in the [[Swabia]]n town of [[Winnenden]] near [[Waiblingen]] ,Germany by Rally driver and mechanic [[Günther Irmscher]], Sr. 

Irmscher has retained close links to the [[Opel]] company by operating the factory team for Opel in many European automobile competitions <ref>http://www.irmscher.de/uk/sport/sportpresse/sportpresse.htm</ref><ref>http://www.irmscher.de/uk/sport/history/history.htm</ref>, including the [[Opel Ascona|Ascona B i400 rally car]] and the [[Opel Omega|Omega]] raced in the discontinued [[V8Star Series]] competition in Germany. However, in the UK the Vauxhall teams are run by [[Triple 8]].

This has led them to design and manufacture parts for [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo/Chevrolet]] <ref>http://www.irmscher.de/pdf/de/files/Prosp_Daewoo-Cad_09-04.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.irmscher.de/pdf/de/files/Captiva_Edition_irm_10_07.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.irmscher.de/int_presse/int_pressemitteilungen.php?dsn=951#</ref> models, the [[Cadillac CTS]] <ref>http://www.irmscher.de/pdf/de/files/Cadillac%20CTS%2003_06.pdf</ref> and wheels for the [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] based [[Saab Automobile|SAAB]] <ref>http://www.irmscher.de/pdf/de/files/Saab_Felgen_05_05.pdf</ref> models, although these are much rarer than the [[Opel]] and [[Vauxhall]] parts. Their distinctive customised parts include [[alloy wheels]], [[Body kit|bodykits]] and [[Internal combustion engine|exhausts]] as well as various interior fittings.
