The '''Axor''' is a truck manufactured by [[Mercedes-Benz]] designed to fill the gap between the premium [[Mercedes-Benz Actros|Actros]] [[tractor unit|tractors]] and the mostly rigid [[Mercedes-Benz Atego|Atego]] trucks and was targeted at [[Fleet vehicles|fleet]] customers.

The truck is relatively simple, with manual [[gearshift]] as opposed to the electronic paddle shift on the Actros. The Axor is powered by a 12 litre straight 6 engine.

==2005==

Originally the Axor was only available as a [[artic|tractor]] but with the 2005 [[facelift]], former Atego models over 18t are now part of the Axor Range.
