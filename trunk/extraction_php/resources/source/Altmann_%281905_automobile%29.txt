The '''Altmann''' was an [[automobile]] made by Kraftfahrzeug-Werke GmbH, Brandenburg/Havel from 1905 to 1907. It was one of only a handful of German [[steam car]] makes, and was quite advanced for the era. Its [[valve timing]] [[engine]] allowed it to follow the Gardner-Serpollet principle, though the engine differed from that design in other aspects. Its three [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s allowed it to produced 15/25 [[brake horsepower|bhp]]. Its use of a condensation system and ensuing low consumption of water gave it an effective rage of around {{convert|125|mi|km|0}} on a single tank of water. The death of its designer, Adolf Altmann, prevented it from being built on a large scale. The firm later went on to build [[electric car]]s.
