The '''C111''' was a series of experimental [[automobile]]s produced by [[Mercedes-Benz]] in the 1960s and 1970s.  The company was experimenting with new engine technologies, including [[Wankel engine]]s, [[Diesel engine]]s, and [[turbocharger]]s, and used the basic C111 platform as a testbed.  Other experimental features included [[gullwing door]]s and a luxurious interior with leather trim and [[air conditioning]].

The [http://emercedesbenz.com/Jul08/31_001312_eMercedesBenz_Feature_A_Look_Back_At_The_Mercedes_Benz_C_111_Research_Vehicle.html first version of the C111] was completed in 1969.  It used a [[fiberglass]] body shell and had a [[Mercedes-Benz_M950F|three-rotor]] direct [[fuel injected]] [[Wankel engine]] mounted [[MR layout|in the middle]].  The next C111 appeared in 1970.  It used a [[Mercedes-Benz_M950F|four-rotor engine]] producing 370&nbsp;hp (275&nbsp;kW).  The car could reportedly hit 290&nbsp;km/h (180&nbsp;mph).

The company decided not to adopt the Wankel engine and turned to [[Diesel engine|Diesel]] experiments for the third C111.  With its {{convert|230|hp}}@ 4,400-4,600 5-speed manual [[straight-5]] turbo-Diesel, the C111 broke nine diesel and gas speed records.  With more [[aerodynamic]] bodywork that gave it an air [[drag coefficient]] of an incredible .191, the C111 eventually hit 200&nbsp;mph (322&nbsp;km/h) at [[Nardò  Ring|Nardò]] in 1978, and averaged  14.7mpg@ 316&nbsp;km/h (195.4&nbsp;mph) over a 12 hour cruise.  A later 500&nbsp;hp (372&nbsp;kW) 4.8&nbsp;L twin KKK-turbocharged [[V8]] version set another record, with an average lap-speed of 403.78 km/h (250.958 mph). It was achieved by Dr. Hans Leibold in 1 minute, 56.67 seconds on May 5, 1979.

Mercedes-Benz introduced the [[Mercedes-Benz C112|C112]] at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in 1991 as a production sports car.  It used a 6.0&nbsp;L [[V12 engine|V12]] engine mounted in the middle.  But after accepting 700 deposits, the company decided not to proceed with production.
