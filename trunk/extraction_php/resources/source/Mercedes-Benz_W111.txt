The "'''Fintail'''" ({{lang-de|Heckflosse}}) was a series of [[luxury vehicle]]s produced by [[Mercedes-Benz]] from 1959 to 1968 under the '''W111''' chassis code.

Though never officially designated as such (they were designated ''Peilstege'', marking the end of the car in rear view mirror), the cars gained the [[nickname]] because of the distinctive rear-end which incorporates small [[tailfin]]s, thought to be an [[understatement|understated]] attempt to appeal to the [[United States]] market at the time (with domestic finned cars, such as the [[Cadillac]]s and [[Buick]]s of the times).

The Fintail is considered part of the lineage of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class flagship model, particularly the initial 6-cylinder W111 and more luxurious [[Mercedes-Benz W112|W112]] models. A 4-cylinder version, the W110, was introduced in 1962. In the S-Class lineage, the Fintail models were succeeded by the larger [[Mercedes-Benz W108|W108/W109]] lines.

The Fintail models were pioneers of the automotive safety feature of [[crumple zones]], which absorb the energy of a collision. The idea for crumple zones came from [[Bela Barenyi]] who worked as an engineer for Mercedes-Benz.<ref>[http://motoring.independent.co.uk/features/article340543.ece Independent article - crumple zone development]</ref>
