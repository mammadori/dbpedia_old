The '''BMW 3/15''' was [[BMW]]'s first car, produced in four versions from December 1927 to early 1932. 18,976 BMW 3/15s were manufactured between 1929 and 1932.<ref name=Norbye249>Norbye, p.249</ref>

In 1927, [[Automobilwerk Eisenach|Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach]], which manufactured automobiles under the Dixi marque, entered a contract with the [[Austin Motor Company]] to manufacture the [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]] under licence.  The first fifty Eisenach-built Sevens were right-hand-drive cars assembled in September 1927 from parts provided by Austin's factory in [[Longbridge]].  By December 1927, Dixi had begun building their version of the Seven, the left-hand-drive Dixi 3/15 PS DA-1, built from parts made by Dixi.  The 3/15 designation was derived from a taxable horsepower rating of 3 PS with an actual power output of approximately {{convert|15|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}}  The DA-1 designation stood for ''Erste Deutsche Ausführung'' (First German Version)

BMW bought Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach from parent company [[Gothaer Waggonfabrik]] in October 1928.  As a result, the Dixi 3/15 PS DA-1 became the '''[[BMW Dixi]] 3/15 DA-1'''.

The main differences between the BMW Dixi 3/15 DA-1 and the contemporary Austin Seven were the addition of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] shock absorbers, the placement of the driver's controls on the left side of the vehicle, and the use of metric fasteners.

== 3/15 DA-2 ==
[[Image:BMW Dixi 1930.JPG|thumb|left|BMW 3/15 DA2 (1929)]]
The '''3/15 DA-2''' replaced the DA-1 in April 1929.  The main change from the DA-1 was the operation of the brakes on all four wheels by the foot pedal, which had operated only the rear brakes on the DA-1. Other changes included larger tyres and a lower [[Gear ratio|final drive ratio]].  Available body styles included a steel-bodied two-door saloon, a two-seat convertible, and a delivery van.<ref name=Norbye2829>Norbye, pp.28-29</ref>

== 3/15 DA-3 Wartburg ==
The '''3/15 DA-3 Wartburg''' was a [[sports car|sports]] [[roadster]] version of the 3/15, and was consequently BMW's first sports car. A drop-centre front axle was used to lower the frame for a lower centre of gravity.  The compression ratio of the engine was raised to 7.0:1,<ref name=Norbye2829 /> raising power output to {{convert|18|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3500 rpm.<ref name=Norbye2829 /><ref name=bmwccn.no_315_1>BMW 3/15 PS, 315/1 and 319/1 - early roadsters</ref><ref name=Motorsport3_15>BMW Motorsport - BMW 3/15</ref>

The Wartburg was introduced in 1930, and the [[Great Depression]] had drastically reduced the market for sports cars.<ref name=Norbye2829 />  It was discontinued in 1931, with 150 sold.<ref name=Motorsport3_15 />

== 3/15 DA-4 ==
The '''3/15 DA-4''' replaced the DA-2 in mid-February 1931.

While the engine, gearing, and chassis of the DA-4 were unchanged from the original Dixi 3/15 PS DA-1, the DA-4 was a step away from the original Austin design. The DA-4 was the first BMW automobile with [[independent front suspension]], which used the ends of the transverse leaf spring to act as lower control arms, with further wheel location performed by two diagonal leading arms.

The DA-4 was heavier than the DA-2, and a larger wheel diameter was used to compensate for this.<ref name=Norbye2829 />

The Austin-based 3/15 series was discontinued before the March 1932 expiration of BMW's licence to manufacture Austin Sevens.<ref name=Norbye30>Norbye, p.30</ref>

== BMW 3/20 ==
{{main|BMW 3/20}}
[[Image:BMW AM 4 1933 red vl closed top.jpg|left|thumb|BMW 3/20 type AM 4 (1933)]]
The '''BMW 3/20 PS''' was 3/15 successor produced between 1932 and 1934, it was made larger with an {{convert|84.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and a body {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} lower than the 3/15.<ref name="unixnerd.demon.co.uk">Unixnerd: BMW's Early History</ref> The new engine was based on the Austin Seven engine used in the 3/15, but its crankshaft ran in plain bearings instead of roller bearings and had an {{convert|80|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke, generating a displacement of {{convert|788|cc|CID|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Norbye30 />  The new engine design also had a water pump and an [[overhead valve]] [[cylinder head]]. These design changes caused the engine to generate 20 hp, thereby causing the change in model designation. <ref name="unixnerd.demon.co.uk" />  A [[swing axle]] [[independent rear suspension]] with a transverse leaf spring was used along with the DA-4's front suspension to give the 3/20 four wheel independent suspension.<ref name=Norbye30 /> Four versions of the 3/20 were built: AM 1, AM 2, AM 3 and AM 4, where AM denoted ''Automobil München''.<ref name=Norbye30 />
