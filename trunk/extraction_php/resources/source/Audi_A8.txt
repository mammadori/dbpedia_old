The '''Audi A8''' is a four-[[vehicle door|door]] four/five-[[car seat|seat]] [[full-size car|large]] [[luxury vehicle|luxury car]] built by the [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry|automaker]] [[Audi]], to replace the [[Audi V8]] as its [[flagship#automotive|flagship model]].  First brought to the market in 1994, most versions of the A8 have featured Audi's 'trademark' [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] as standard, as well as a [[multitronic]] or [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]]s.  Two generations of the A8 have been produced, in both short and long wheelbase form, and are built on successions of the [[Volkswagen Group D platform]] series.

The A8 debuted in [[Europe]] in 1994, although it wasn't until 1997 that it became available in [[North America]].  Unlike its predecessor, the [[Audi V8]] model, which was built on an existing [[steel]] [[automobile platform|platform]], the A8 debuted on the then-new [[Volkswagen Group D platform#D2|Volkswagen Group D2 platform]], an all [[aluminium]] [[monocoque]], tagged as the {{nowrap|"Audi Space Frame"}} (ASF), which helped to significantly reduce [[weight]], without sacrificing structural rigidity.  The [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] was offered in both the A8 (standard wheelbase), and the A8L extended or long-[[wheelbase]] (LWB) version.  The A8L adds {{convert|5|in|0|lk=on}} of rear legroom.  In addition to being the world's first car built on an entirely [[aluminium]] platform, updates to the car in 1997 included the addition of six interior [[airbag]]s, making the A8 the first [[motor vehicle|vehicle]] to be so equipped.

For 1997, the new A8 was available with either [[front-wheel drive]] (FWD), or the [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]].  The FWD models are powered by a 2.8&nbsp;[[litre]] [[V6 engine]], producing {{convert|193|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on|lk=on}}, and 3.7&nbsp;litre [[V8 engine]] producing {{convert|233|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, while the quattro received a 4.2&nbsp;litre V8 producing {{convert|304|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}.

The A8 is available with standard luxury amenities, including dual-zone [[climate control]], wood and leather interior trim, 14-way power and heated seats, and an enhanced [[Bose Corporation|BOSE]] audio system.  

In 1999, Audi's flagship received new colours, and restructuring of option packages.  The [[North America]]n "warm weather package" added a solar [[sunroof#sunroof types|sunroof]] which allows the interior ventilation fans to run, keeping the interior cool whilst the car is parked with the engine turned off.  Changes to all models included a larger passenger mirror,{{clarify|interior rear view, or door|date=November 2008}} and a [[first aid kit]] located in the rear centre armrest.

The 2000 [[model year]] saw a minor front-end restyle, with new, larger, clear [[headlamp|headlights]], a revised [[grille]], and lower front valance with standard projection fog lamps.  On the interior, the seats received a new, horizontal stitch pattern.  Also, the 3.7&nbsp;litre FWD model was dropped, leaving only the long-wheelbase and short-wheelbase 4.2&nbsp;litre quattro.  These restyled cars also featured revised external door handles and an integrated radio antenna.

For 2001, A8 received minimal changes, the biggest being the added "SIDEGUARD" curtain [[airbag]]s.  In 2001, Audi introduced its new [[W12 engine]], a compact 6.0&nbsp;litre unit developed by effectively mating two [[VR6 engine]]s together at the [[crankshaft]].  The engine quickly became available in the A8, though only to [[Europe]]an and [[Asia]]n customers.  From its introduction through its discontinuation in 2003, only 750 of the "W12" models were produced.

In 2002, the A8L received standard [[xenon arc lamp|xenon]] [[high-intensity discharge lamp]] (HID) headlights, and a heated steering wheel.  A [[tire pressure monitoring system|tyre pressure monitoring system]] (TPMS), an updated Symphony II stereo, and new exterior colours were also added.

===A8 Coupé prototype===
[[Image:A8 Coupe.JPG|thumb|200px|left|1997 Audi A8 Coupé built by [[IVM Automotive]]]]
In 1997, [[IVM Automotive]] of [[Munich]], Germany built a two-door Audi A8 Coupé.  The car was unveiled at the 1997 [[Salon International de l'Auto|Geneva Motor Show]].  Audi contracted IVM to build the [[prototype]], and was considering production of the vehicle.  The [[coupé]] had a re-engineered aluminium body, shorter than the production A8 saloon.  Like the [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class]], there was no central "B" pillar, giving the car a seamless design with a gradually sloping roofline.  The car included custom leather seats which could seat four.  Ultimately, Audi decided not to put the A8 Coupé into production, citing lower-than-expected sales figures for the similar [[BMW 8 Series]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W140|Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupé]].  Only one A8 Coupé was ever built.  The single prototype, painted a colour called "Ming Blue pearl," remains the property of IVM Automotive, and resides in Munich.  Its last public appearance was in 2002 on a series of test drives.{{-}}

[[Image:06-08 Audi A8 4.2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|2006-2007 Audi A8 4.2 (US)]]
The second-generation A8 built on the [[Volkswagen Group D platform#D3|Volkswagen Group D3 platform]] was introduced in late 2003.  The model was longer than the previous generation, with room for four or five large adult occupants in the cabin, depending on rear seat configuration.

As with the previous version, two body variants of the second generation A8 are offered, the A8 (standard, or short wheelbase), and the long-[[wheelbase]] (LWB) A8L.  The A8L adds {{convert|120|mm|0|lk=on}} to the rear legroom and {{convert|11|mm|2|abbr=on}} to the overall height of the car.

Audi restyled the D3 platform A8 range slightly in 2005, endowing all variants with a taller, wider [[trapezoid]]al ''single-frame'' grille, inspired by that of the [[Audi Nuvolari quattro|Nuvolari quattro]] [[concept car]].  The top-of-the-line [[W12 engine]]d '''W12''' version was the first model to be equipped with this grille; [[V8 engine]]d models were fitted with the new grille the following year.  In addition to the styling update, new [[internal combustion engine]]s became available to [[Europe]]an and [[Asia]]n market customers.  The entry-level 3.0&nbsp;[[litre]] [[V6 engine]] was replaced with a new 3.2&nbsp;litre unit featuring [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), which it shared with the [[Audi A4#B7|Audi A4 (B7)]] and [[Audi A6#C6|Audi A6 (C6)]].

This generation A8 introduced the {{convert|326|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on|lk=on}} 4.2&nbsp;litre [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[V8 engine]] - the most powerful [[diesel engine]] Audi has ever offered in a passenger automobile, before the debut of Audi's 6.0&nbsp;litre [[V12 engine|V12]] TDI engine in the [[Audi Q7]].  The engine uses two [[turbocharger]]s and two [[intercooler]]s, with each turbocharger functioning exclusively for one bank of four [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]].  The 2.8&nbsp;litre V6 FSI, which is recently added to the A8 range, has a class leading 199&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emission.

For 2008, the A8 received a facelift and also received new electronic safety systems.<ref>[http://www.caranddriver.com/autoshows/13861/2008-audi-a8.html Audi A8 update in 2008]</ref> "Audi Side Assist" detects cars in the A8's blind spots.  "[[Lane Departure Warning System|Audi Lane Assist]]" helps when the driver attempts to change lanes without signaling first.

==Audi S8 variants{{anchor|S8}}==<!-- This section is linked from [[Audi S8]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->
{{main|Audi S8}}
Audi has produced two generations of the '''Audi S8 quattro''', a high performance variant in the vein of [[Mercedes-Benz AMG]] [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]] models.  Both incarnations of the S8 use the [[wheelbase#varying wheelbases within nameplate|standard wheelbase]] [[automobile platform|platform]] (not the long-wheelbase of the A8L).  

The S8 was first produced in 1996, and compared to the standard A8, it has a re-tuned, {{convert|250|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} version of the standard [[V8 engine]] (subsequently upgraded to {{convert|265|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}), a re-tuned [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], with larger [[alloy wheel]]s and upgraded [[tire|tyres]], uprated and enlarged [[brake]]s, and a re-calibrated version of the five-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]].  A six-speed [[manual transmission]] option was available, but this was not offered in [[North America]].  [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] was standard.  Production of the first-generation S8 ended in September 2002, shortly before the introduction of the D3-platform A8.

In the last quarter of 2005, Audi previewed the second-generation S8, now called the '''Audi S8 5.2 FSI quattro''', powered by a {{convert|331|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#5.2 FSI V10 320-331kW|5.2 FSI V10 engine]].  Full production started in June 2006.  The S8 is comparable to Audi's top-of-the-line long-[[wheelbase]] A8L [[W12 engine|W12]], though the the W12 is more expensive, and has more torque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/2009/07/09/inside-story-2009-audi-s8.htm|title=2009 Audi S8|work=CanadianDriver Communications Inc.|publisher=CanadianDriver.com|date=9 July 2009|accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref>  The S8's top speed is electronically limited to {{convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.
