The '''Trabant''' is an [[automobile]] that was produced by former [[East Germany|East German]] auto maker [[HQM Sachsenring GmbH|VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau]] in [[Zwickau]], [[Sachsen]]. It was the most common vehicle in [[East Germany]], and was also exported to countries both inside and outside the [[communist bloc]]. The main selling point was that it had room for four adults and luggage in a compact, light and durable shell. Despite its mediocre performance and smoky [[two-stroke engine]], the car is regarded with derisive affection as a symbol of the failed former East Germany and of the fall of [[communism]] (in former West Germany, as many East Germans streamed into [[West Berlin]] and [[West Germany]] in their Trabants after the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989). For advocates of [[capitalism]] it is often cited as an example of the disadvantages of [[planned economy|centralized planning]] as even refueling the car required lifting the hood, filling the tank with gasoline (only 24 litres<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/2722019/Anyone-for-Trabants.html "Daily Telegraph"]</ref>), then adding two-stroke oil and shaking it back and forth to mix. It was in production without any significant changes for nearly 30 years with 3,096,099 Trabants produced in total.<ref>[http://www.trabant.ca/ "Trabant Canada"]</ref>

==Overview==
[[Image:Trabant 601 Mulhouse FRA 001.JPG|thumb|A Trabant 601 Limousine.]]
[[Image:Trabant 2.JPG|thumb|A view inside the Trabant 601]]
The name was inspired by Soviet [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]]. The cars are often referred to as the '''Trabbi''' or '''Trabi''', pronounced with a short a.

Since it could take years (usual waiting time 15 years) for a Trabant to be delivered from the time it was ordered, people who finally got one were very careful with it and usually became skilful in maintaining and repairing it. The lifespan of an average Trabant was 28 years.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.pbs.org/saf/transcripts/transcript402.htm#4 PBS - Scientific American Frontiers:Previous Shows:Transcripts:Special From Germany<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Used Trabants would often fetch a higher price than new ones, as the former were available immediately, while the latter had the aforementioned waiting period of mostly at least ten years.

There were two principal variants of the Trabant, the '''Trabant 500''', also known as the '''Trabant P 50''', produced 1957-1963; and the '''Trabant 601''' (or '''Trabant P 60''' series), produced from 1963 to 1991, with a 1.1L VW engine being introduced in 1990 (see below). The engine for both the ''Trabant 500'' and original ''601'' was a small [[two-stroke]] engine with two cylinders, giving the vehicle modest performance. At the end of production in 1989 it delivered 19 [[kilowatt|kW]] (26 [[horsepower]]) from a 600 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] [[Engine displacement|displacement]]. The car took 21 seconds from 0 to 100 [[km/h]] (62&nbsp;mph) and the top speed was 112&nbsp;km/h (70&nbsp;mph). There were two main problems with the engine: the smoky exhaust and the pollution it produced—nine times the amount of hydrocarbons and five times the carbon monoxide emissions of the average European car of 2007. The fuel consumption was {{convert|7|L/100 km|abbr=on}}14,28&nbsp;km/l.<ref>[http://www.transtrabant.cz/small-car/ Trans National Trabant Tour 2007]</ref>

The Trabant was a steel [[monocoque]] design with roof, bootlid/trunklid, bonnet/hood, bumpers/fenders and doors in [[Duroplast]], a form of [[plastic]] containing [[resin]] strengthened by wool or cotton. This helped the GDR to avoid expensive steel imports, but in theory did not provide much crash protection, although in crash tests it allegedly performed superior to some contemporary Western [[hatchback]]s.<ref>[http://home.clara.net/peterfrost/trabant.html Sachsenring Trabant]</ref><ref>[http://www.trabirent.com/trabanthistory.html TrabiRent]</ref> The Trabant was the second car to use Duroplast, after the "pre-Trabant" '''P70''' ([[Zwickau (car)|Zwickau]]) model (1954–1959). The duroplast was made of recycled material, cotton waste from Russia and phenol resins from the East German dye industry, making the Trabant the first car with a body made of recycled material.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

== History ==
[[Image:Trabant P50.jpg|thumb|Trabant P50 built in 1959.]]
Originally planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle, the decision to build a four-wheeled car came late in the planning process.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2542584,00.html DW: Go, Trabi, Go! East Germany's Darling Car Turns 50]</ref> The name ''Trabant'', which in medieval German denoted a foot soldier or personal guard<ref>Anatoly Liberman, J. Lawrence Mitchell: ''An analytic dictionary of English etymology'', 2008 (second edition), ISBN 0816652724, p. 208 ([http://books.google.cz/books?id=_m7k1Oi-cakC at the Google books]). The term was possibly borrowed from the Czech language.</ref>, was chosen in an internal contest in 1957, the year of [[Sputnik]], the first artificial [[satellite]]. Previous motorcycle production at Sachsenring had been under the aegis of ''AWZ'' (Auto-Werke [[Zwickau (car)|Zwickau]]).

The Trabant was a relatively advanced car when it was launched in 1958; with [[front wheel drive]], a [[unitary construction]], composite bodywork and independent suspension all around. The main letdown was the engine: by the late 1950s small cars in western countries mainly used cleaner and more efficient [[four-stroke]] engines, as employed in the [[Volkswagen]], whereas the budgetary constraints forced to use a two-stroke engine in the Trabant. When released the Trabant was technically equivalent to the West German [[Lloyd (car)|Lloyd]] automobile, which had an air cooled two-cylinder four-stroke engine in the same size vehicle.

The Trabant's air cooled two cylinder 500cc (later 600cc) [[two-stroke]] engine was derived from a pre-war [[DKW]] design, with minor alterations being made throughout the car's production run. [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]], a GDR manufacturer of larger saloons, also used a [[DKW]] engine: a water-cooled 3 cylinder 1000 cc two-stroke unit, also found in earlier [[Saab]] cars.

In 1958 production began of the original Trabant, the P50. This car was the base of the Trabant series, and even the latest 1.1s had a large number of interchangeable parts with this car. The 500cc {{convert|18|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} P50 evolved into a {{convert|20|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version in 1960, gaining a fully synchronized gearbox amongst other things, and finally got a 23&nbsp;hp 600 cc engine in 1962, becoming the P60.

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0503-0015-001, Sachsenring Trabant 601.jpg|thumb|left|Trabant 601 presentation in 1963.]]
The updated P601 was introduced in 1964. This car was essentially a facelift of the P60, with a different front fascia, bonnet, roof and rear, whilst retaining the original P50 underpinnings.
This model stayed practically unchanged up to its production end, with the most major changes being 12v electrics, coil springs for the rear and a different dash for the latest models.

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0315-006, Zwickau, Trabi ade.jpg|thumb|Production of the last Trabants in 1990.]]

In 1989 a licensed version of the [[Volkswagen Polo]] engine replaced the elderly two-stroke engine, the result of a trade agreement between the two German states. The model, known as the '''Trabant 1.1''' also had minor improvements to the brake and signal lights, a revised grille and replaced the leaf spring-suspended chassis with one using [[MacPherson strut]]s. However, by the time it entered production in May 1990, the two states had already agreed to [[German reunification]]. The inefficient, labor-intensive production line was kept open only because of government subsidies. Demand plummeted, as residents of the east preferred second-hand western cars. The production line closed in 1991 and the factory in Mosel (Zwickau), where the Trabant 1.1 had been made, was sold to Volkswagen. The rest of the company became [[HQM Sachsenring GmbH]].

The Trabant's designers expected production to extend to 1967 at the latest, and East German designers and engineers created a series of more sophisticated prototypes through the years that were intended to replace the Trabi; several of these can be seen at the Dresden Transport Museum. However, each proposal for a new model was rejected by the GDR leadership for reasons of cost. As a result, the Trabant remained in production largely unchanged; in contrast, the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] automobiles were continually updated and exported successfully. The Trabant's production method, which was extremely labor-intensive, remained unchanged.

Although Trabants had been exported from East Germany, they became well-known in the West after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] when many were abandoned by their Eastern owners after migrating westward. News reports inaccurately described them as having [[Paperboard|cardboard]] bodies. This is likely due to the fact that the body of the Trabant was [[Duroplast]], a material that, in East German production, often made use of varying quantities of different fibers, such as cotton, or occasionally paper.

In the early 1990s it was possible to buy a Trabant for as little as a few marks, and many were given away. Later, as they became collectors' items, prices recovered, but they remain very cheap cars. Green Trabants are especially popular as they are said to bring good luck. The popular culture surrounding the Trabant was referenced by the [[performance artist]] [[Liz Cohen]] in her ''Bodywork'' project, which transformed an East German 1987 Trabant into a 1973 [[Chevrolet]] [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]].<ref>{{cite web

In the late 1990s, there were plans to put the Trabant back into production in [[Uzbekistan]] as the Olimp.<ref>[http://www.moscowtimes.ru/stories/1997/08/16/050.html Trabant Clunks Back to Life<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, only a single model was produced.<ref>[http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/040Compecon/Soviet/Uzbek/040900autos.txt AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY IN UZBEKISTAN]</ref>

Former [[Bulgaria]]n [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bulgaria)|Foreign Minister]] and [[Atlantic Club of Bulgaria]] founding president [[Solomon Passy]] owned a famous Trabant, which he used to take [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary Generals]] [[Manfred Wörner]], [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George Robertson]] and [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] for a ride. Passy's Trabant was also blessed by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2002. In 2005, Passy donated the vehicle, which had become a symbol of Bulgaria's NATO accession, to the [[National Historical Museum (Bulgaria)|National Historical Museum of Bulgaria]].<ref name="vesti">{{cite news|url=http://www.vesti.bg/?tid=40&oid=752914|title=Соломон Паси подари трабанта си на НИМ|date=2005-07-13|publisher=Вести|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>

In 1997, the Trabant was celebrated for passing the "Elchtest" ("[[moose test]]"), a {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} swerve manoeuvre [[slalom]], without toppling over like the [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class]] infamously did. A newspaper from [[Thuringia]] had a headline saying "Come and get us, moose! Trabi passes A-Class killer test".<ref>[http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=9663 Petite feat - drive.com.au]</ref>

In 2007 [[Herpa]], a miniature vehicles manufacturer in Bavaria, showed a scale model of the "New Trabi" and revealed that they planned to introduce it. They bought the rights to the name and plan to produce a series of 5,000 cars. It would likely have a BMW engine and be sold for around €50,000.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/06/news/trabi.php International Herald Tribune: The 'Trabi' automobile, once a symbol of East Germany, to be revived]</ref><ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2773343,00.html Deutsche Welle: German Firm Plans to Launch Revamped Trabant]</ref>

In 2007 the Trabant (A P50 painted British Racing Green) was brought into the world of [[diplomacy]]. Steven Fisher, the Deputy Head of Mission in the British Embassy of [[Budapest]] uses it as his [[diplomatic car]] for work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20081204/british-deputy-ambassadors-ride-small-and-green |title=British Deputy Ambassador's ride small and green |publisher=Politics.Hu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref>

In August 2009 it was announced that a new Trabant powered by an electric engine will be unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show on 17 September with production starting if investment can be secured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/frankfurt-motor-show/6023813/Smoke-belching-Trabant-to-be-reborn-as-electric-car.html |title=Smoke-belching Trabant to be reborn as electric car |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8201313.stm |title=German group develops new Trabant |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref>

== Trabant and car tuning community ==
[[Image:Rockhall lobby cars 2005.jpg|thumb|The painted Trabants used by U2 on their Zoo TV tour are displayed on The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].]]
[[Image:Trabant RS02(ThKraft).jpg|thumb|left|Trabant as a racing car]]
The particularly archaic look and unique two-stroke engine sound of the Trabant has made it become a beloved model amongst the [[car tuning]] community in central Europe.

Many variations exist although two major streams have been developed.

The first stream meticulously preserves the two-stroke engine sound, while either tuning the original two cylinder engine for higher performance or using a two-stroke propulsion unit designed for another car (e.g. the 1000 cc [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]]). Since the car is very lightweight (approx. 750&nbsp;kg), a small increase in engine power can rapidly increase its [[power to weight ratio]], giving it a remarkable boost.

The second stream goes beyond the sentimental sound and encompass a range of modifications from a complete engine swap to a thorough upgrade on the traction of Trabant, leaving only the chassis to hide a modern powerful car underneath (e.g. the Sascha Fiss' [[Volkswagen Lupo]] GTI). Some say that the perplexing effect caused by a postmodern Trabi that can overtake modern cars as described above {{convert|150|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} is worth all the efforts.

Some cars with supercharged implants have a rated power over {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} which allows them to achieve a performance comparable to drag racers due to its light body weight.

It has become an established tradition for Trabant fan clubs in central Europe to organize annual meetings to present new tuning modifications and performance accessories for the vehicle.

==Potential revival==
Even though Trabant doesn't have a history of being [[Green Energy|green]], two German companies are trying to find investors to create the Trabant nT, an [[electric car]] that will be equipped with a 45&nbsp;kW [[asynchronous motor]] powered with a [[lithium-ion battery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-cars-all-electric-trabant-nt-gears-to-clean-20-year-old-mess |title=Eco Cars: All-electric Trabant NT Gears To Clean 20-year-old Mess |publisher=Ecofriend |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref>  The nT will have a 100 mile (160&nbsp;km) range on a full charge, a top speed of 80 [[miles per hour|mph]] (128&nbsp;km/h), and a cost of US$29,000 or about €19,600.
