{{Main|History of BMW}}

After World War I, BMW was forced to cease aircraft (engine) production by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Armistice Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pilotenschule.ch/geschichte.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070528021613/http://www.pilotenschule.ch/geschichte.htm |archivedate=2007-05-28 |title= Fliegerschule St.Gallen - history|accessdate=2008-08-24 |language=German }}</ref> The company consequently shifted to [[motorcycle]] production in 1923 once the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=8XEV3HRlBZ4C|title=BMW Motorcycles|author=Darwin Holmstrom, Brian J.

The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel is portrayed by BMW as the movement of an aircraft propeller, to signify the white blades cutting through the blue sky &ndash; an interpretation that BMW adopted for convenience in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jeff.dean.home.att.net/roundel-myth.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Origin of the BMW Logo: Fact and Fiction |date= |accessdate= 1 August 2009|author=Dr. Florian Triebel | work= Mobile Tradition live / Issue 01.2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Uniquely BMW|volume= 1|year=2006|publisher=BMW North America}}</ref> The emblem evolved from the circular  [[Rapp Motorenwerke]] company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the white and blue colors of the flag of [[Bavaria]], reversed to produce the BMW roundel.

BMW's first significant aircraft engine was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, much preferred for its high-altitude performance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the [[Luftwaffe]]. Among its successful [[World War II|WWII]] engine designs were the [[BMW 132]] and [[BMW 801]] air-cooled [[radial engines]], and the pioneering [[BMW 003]] [[axial compressor|axial-flow]] [[turbojet]], which powered the tiny, 1944-45-era jet-powered "emergency fighter", the [[Heinkel He 162]] ''Salamander.''  The [[BMW 003]] jet engine was tested in the A-1b version of the world's first jet fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]], but BMW engines failed on takeoff, a major setback for the jet fighter program until successful testing with Junkers engines.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dSLBdP22fq0C&pg=PA31 |title=The Jet Race and the Second World War |first=Sterling Michael |last=Pavelec |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=007 |isbn=0275993558, 9780275993559}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Radinger |first=Will |first2= Walter |last2=Schick. |title=Me262 (in German) |location=Berlin |publisher=Avantic Verlag GmbH |year=1996 |isbn=3-925505-21-0 |page=23 }}</ref>

By 1959 the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find a way of carrying on. It was decided to carry on and to try to cash in on the current economy car boom enjoyed so successfully by some of Germany's ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. The rights to manufacture the Italian [[Isetta|Iso Isetta]] were bought, the tiny cars themselves were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's own motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet. The controlling majority shareholder of the BMW [[Stock corporation|Aktiengesellschaft]] since 1959 is the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in [[public float]].

In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in [[California]]n-based [[industrial design]] studio [[DesignworksUSA]], which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British [[Rover Group]]<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=KdbY5QkQ64cC|title=Corporate Cultures And Global Brands|author=Albrecht Rothacher|year=2004|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9812388567|pages=239}}</ref> (which at the time consisted of the [[Rover (car)|Rover]], [[Land Rover]] and [[MG (car)|MG]] brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Morris Motor Company|Morris]]), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was making huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form [[MG Rover]], while Land Rover was taken over by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new [[BMW MINI|MINI]], which was launched in 2001.

Chief designer [[Chris Bangle]] announced his departure from BMW after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years. He will be replaced by [[Adrian van Hooydonk]], Bangle's former right hand man. Bangle was famously (or infamously) known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for [[Husqvarna Motorcycles]] was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. [[BMW Motorrad]] plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.

===Nazi connections===
[[Günther Quandt]], whose family became major shareholders of BMW 15 years after the war, was a member of the [[Nazi]] Party from 1933. After Hitler's election he was appointed to the position of Leader of the Armament Economy, which was a title given to industrialists who played a leading role in the Nazi war economy. Quandt's factories supplied ammunition, rifles, artillery and batteries for the Nazis and, it is claimed, used slave labourers from [[concentration camp]]s in some of his factories.<ref name="businessweek.com">[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/oct2007/gb20071010_765240.htm BMW's Quandt Family Faces Its Nazi Past]</ref> Quandt's first wife, Magda, later married the Nazi propaganda chief, [[Joseph Goebbels]].<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-gigolo-the-german-heiress-and-a-1636m-revenge-for-her-nazi-legacy-986855.html The gigolo, the German heiress, and a £6m revenge for her Nazi legacy]</ref>

A documentary which aired on German TV in 2007 claimed that Quandt not only utilized slave labour, but also sidestepped postwar recrimination. BMW itself was not implicated in the documentary, and the firm has made no comment about the Quandts, but claims to have confronted its own wartime history via independent research projects.<ref name="businessweek.com"/>  The Quandt family responded by pledging to fund a research project into the family's Nazi past and its role under the Third Reich.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7035485.stm Quandts to reveal Nazi-era links]</ref>

Former Danish [[freedom fighter]] Carl Adolf Sørensen (b. ca. 1927) has been asked to meet with the Quandt family and possibly receive compensation, but has repeatedly refused to do so on the grounds that it is too late. In 1943, as a 17-year-old, he and 39 other resistance fighters were sent to Germany where they worked with dangerous chemicals, some dying within a few months, and only four of the group are still alive (as of May 2009).<ref>{{cite web|author=Af Peter Suppli Benson Lørdag den 9. maj 2009, 20:45 |url=http://www.berlingske.dk/article/20090509/danmark/705090081/ |title=BMW brugte danske tvangsarbejdere - Danmark |work=[[Berlingske Tidende]] |language=Danish |date= |accessdate=2009-05-10}}</ref>

[[Image:R32-pn.jpg|thumb|right|The [[BMW R32|R32]], the first BMW [[motorcycle]].]]

BMW began building motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after [[World War I]]. Its motorcycle brand is now known as [[BMW Motorrad]]. Their first successful motorcycle, after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "[[BMW R32|R32]]" in 1923. This had a "[[flat-twin|Boxer]]" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMWs are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R Series|R Series]].

[[Image:R35-roundel.jpg|thumb|left|BMW roundel in 1939]]During the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a [[sidecar]] attached. Featuring a unique design copied from the [[Zündapp]] KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven.  Combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the [[Willys MB|Jeep]].

In 1983, came the [[History of BMW motorcycles#K Series|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F Series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G Series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.

In the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to 100&nbsp;hp (75&nbsp;kW) for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to 85&nbsp;hp (63&nbsp;kW) of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead and hexhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{Convert|98|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.

[[Image:K1200gt600.jpg|thumb|right|BMW [[BMW K1200GT|K1200GT]]]]
In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It is both powerful (the engine is a {{Convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} unit derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team) and significantly lighter than previous K models. It was BMW's latest attempt to keep up with the pace of development of sports machines from the likes of [[Honda]], [[Kawasaki motorcycles|Kawasaki]], [[Yamaha]], and [[Suzuki]]. Innovations include a unique electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork BMW calls Duolever.

BMW was one of the earliest manufacturers to offer [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s.  The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of sophisticated [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology &ndash; a first for production motorcycles &ndash; later in the 2007 model year.

BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to [[Motorcycle fork#Earles fork|Earles Fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).

Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles Fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.

===New Class===
{{Main|BMW New Class}}

The ''New Class'' (German: ''Neue Klasse'') was a line of compact [[sedan (car)|sedans]] and coupes starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW's celebrated [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] [[BMW M10|M10]] engine, the New Class models featured a fully [[independent suspension]], [[MacPherson strut]]s in front, and front disc brakes. Initially a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the ''02 Series'' 1600 and 2002 in 1966.

Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW [[3 Series]], the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in "0" were replaced by the larger [[BMW 5 Series]] in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] [[BMW E9]], introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, the 2002 replaced by the 320i in 1975.

===Current models===
[[Image:BMW E90.JPG|thumb|BMW 3-Series (E90)]]
The [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]], launched in 2004, is BMW's smallest car, and available in coupe/convertible (E82/E88) and hatchback (E81/E87) forms. The [[BMW 3 Series|3 Series]], a compact [[executive car]] manufactured since [[model year]] 1975, is currently in its fifth generation ([[BMW E90|E90]]); models include the sport sedan (E90), station wagon (E91), coupe (E92), and convertible (E93). Since its first generation, the 3-Series is considered to be the benchmark, and competitors are often judged on how close they come to this car. In some countries, it has even outsold significantly cheaper models, most notably Ford Mondeo in the UK, and accounts for a majority of BMW's worldwide sales. The [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series]] is a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[executive car]], available in sedan (E60) and station wagon (E61) forms.  The [[BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo|5 Series Gran Turismo]] (F07), beginning in 2010, will create a segment between station wagons and [[crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newbmwseries.com/2009/05/bmw-5-series-gran-turismo/ |title=BMW 5-Series Gran Turismo |accessdate=2009-10-22 |work=reported by newBMWseries.com}}</ref>

[[Image:Bmw-f01-wiki-paultan.org.jpg|thumb|BMW 7-Series (F01)]]
BMW's [[full-size car|full-size]] flagship executive [[sedan (car)|sedan]] is the [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]]. Typically, BMW introduces many of their innovations first in the 7 Series, such as the somewhat controversial [[iDrive]] system. The 7 Series Hydrogen, featuring one of the world's first [[hydrogen]] fueled internal combustion engines, is fueled by liquid hydrogen and emits only clean water vapor. The latest generation (F01) debuted in 2009. Based on the 5 Series' platform, the [[BMW 6 Series|6 Series]] is BMW's [[grand tourer|grand touring]] [[luxury vehicle|luxury]] sport coupe/convertible (E63/E64). A 2-seater [[roadster]] and [[coupe]] which succeeded the [[BMW Z3|Z3]], the [[BMW Z4|Z4]] (E85) has been sold since 2002. 

[[Image:BMW X3 2.jpg|thumb|right|BMW X3 SUV (E83)]]
The [[BMW X3|X3]] (E83), BMW's first [[crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]] (called [[BMW Sports Activity Series|SAV]] or "Sports Activity Vehicle" by BMW) debuted in 2003 and is based on the E46/16 3 Series platform. Marketed in Europe as an off-roader, it benefits from BMW's xDrive all-wheel drive system. The all-wheel drive [[BMW X5|X5]] (E70) is a mid-size luxury SUV (SAV) sold by BMW since 2000. A 4-seat crossover SUV released by BMW in December 2007, the [[BMW X6|X6]] is marketed as a "Sports Activity Coupe" (SAC) by the BMW. The upcoming [[BMW X1|X1]] extends the BMW Sports Activity Series model lineup.

===BMW M models===
{{Main|BMW M}}
[[Image:BMW M3 E92 coupe front.jpg|thumb|BMW M3 Coupé (E92)]]
Based on the 3 Series, the [[BMW M3|M3]] defined an entirely new market for BMW: a race-ready production vehicle. Since its debut, the M3 is heralded in enthusiast circles, in large part due to its unique geometry and award winning engines. The newest V8-powered platform became available the Autumn of 2007 in Europe, and second quarter of 2008 for the U.S. in coupe (E92), and later the cabriolet (E93), and sedan (E90) variants. Based on the 5 Series, the [[BMW M5|M5]] is the M division's V10-powered version of the E60 5 Series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/mseries/m5/2007/_shared/pdf/m5_sedan_touring_datasheet.pdf |title=Equipment and Technical data |accessdate=2008-05-17 |format=PDF |work=BMW AG}}</ref> The [[BMW M6|M6]] is the M division's version of the 6 Series, and shares its drivetrain with the M5. The Z4 M, or [[BMW M Coupe|M Coupe]]/[[BMW M Roadster|M Roadster]], is the M division's version of the Z4. The [[BMW X5#X5M|X5M]] is the M division's version of the X5, and the [[BMW X6#X6M|X6M]] is the M division's version of the X6. Both the X5M and X6M share the same V8 twin scroll twin turbo.

==Environmental record==
The company is a charter member of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) National Environmental Achievement Track, which recognizes companies for their environmental stewardship and performance. It is also a member of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program and is on the [[Dow Jones]] Sustainability Group Index, which rates environmentally friendly companies.<ref>Grahl, C:  “Green finishing”, page 35(4).  Industrial Paint & Powder, 2006</ref>
BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles.

BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European states.

At brand level, too, BMW does better than its main competitors in the premium segment by significantly more than half a litre of fuel consumption with an average level of 160 g CO2/km.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The vehicles of the next best competitor{{Clarify|what are the competitors?|date=June 2009}} have a CO2 emissions level of 16 grams more than the models of the brand BMW, with the next competitor after this at a level which is as much as 28 g higher than the brand BMW - equal to a whole litre of diesel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Between 2006 and 2008, the brand BMW achieved a reduction in fuel consumption of 16%, more than doubling the reduction attained by the next best premium segment competitor. At the same, BMW vehicles are still well ahead of their competitors in terms of average engine output.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of [[greenwash]] in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during [[hydrogen fuel]] production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution.<ref>

==BMW nomenclature==
BMW vehicles follow a certain nomenclature; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the [[engine displacement]] in cubic centimeters divided by 100.<ref>W.P. BMW Group Canada Inc. http://www.bmw.ca</ref> A [[History of BMW motorcycles#Model designation|similar nomenclature]] is used by [[BMW Motorrad]] for their motorcycles.

The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:
* A = [[automatic transmission]]
* C = [[coupe]] on E46 model
* c = [[convertible|cabriolet]]
* d = [[diesel engine|diesel]]<sup>†</sup>
* e = [[BMW M20|eta]] (efficient economy, from the [[eta|Greek letter 'η']])
* g = [[compressed natural gas|compressed natural gas/CNG]]
* h = [[hydrogen]]
* i = [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]]
* L = [[wheelbase|long wheelbase]]
* s = sport, also means "2 dr" on E36 model<sup>††</sup>
* sDrive = [[rear wheel drive]]
* T = [[station wagon|touring (wagon/estate)]]
* IT = [[hatchback]]
* x / xDrive = [[BMW xDrive]] [[all wheel drive]]

<sup>†</sup> historic nomenclature indicating "td" refers to "Turbo Diesel", not a diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)

<sup>††</sup> typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded wheels, etc.

For example, a BMW 760Li is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 6.0 liters of displacement.

However, there are exceptions.<ref>Carver, Robert. BMW San Antonio. BMW Information http://www.mrbimmer.com/bmw.information</ref> The BMW 125i/128i is a 3.0 naturally-aspirated engine, not a 2500cc or 2800cc engine as the series designation number would leave one to believe. The 2007 BMW 328i is a 3 Series that has a 3.0 liter engine. The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5 liter engines. The E36 318i made after 1996 has a 1.9L engine ([[BMW M44|M44]]) as opposed to the 1.8L ([[BMW M42|M42]]) used in the 92-95 models. The 2007 BMW 335i also has a 3.0 liter engine; however it is [[turbocharger|twin-turbocharged]], which is not identified by the nomenclature.

The 'M' - for [[BMW M|Motorsport]] - identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own series.

When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, featuring extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.

When 'X' is capitalized and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), featuring [[BMW xDrive|BMW's xDrive]].

The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).

Previous X & Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in liters). BMW is now globally standardizing this nomenclature on X & Z vehicles<ref>FAQ from the BMW Z4 Press Conference, as reported by BMWBLOG, May 8, 2009. http://www.bmwblog.com/2009/05/08/faq-from-the-recent-bmw-press-conference</ref> by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear wheel drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).

==Community==
[[Image:BMW Logo für Werbung auf Gestell montiert.JPG|thumb|BMW logo sign in [[Düsseldorf]]]]
From the summer of 2001 until October, 2005, BMW hosted the {{cite web |url=http://www.bmwfilms.com/ |title=BMW Films |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927185229/http://www.bmwfilms.com/ |archivedate=2007-09-27}} website, showcasing sporty models being driven to extremes. These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a ground-breaking online advertising campaign.

Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attend [[Bimmerfest]]. One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the U.S., over 3,000 people attended in 2006, and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on May 5.

===The arts===
[[File:Alexander Calder, 1975 BMW 3.0 CSL.jpg|thumb|left|1975 BMW 3.0CSL painted by Alexander Calder.]]

Manufacturers employ [[Industrial design|designer]]s for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design.

==Overseas subsidiaries==
===South Africa===
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1970, when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in [[Rosslyn]], near [[Pretoria]]. BMW acquired the company  in 1973, which became '''BMW South Africa''', the first wholly-owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that [[BMW Motorsport]]  created for the South African market were the BMW 333i, which added a 6-cylinder 3.2 litre engine to the [[BMW E30|BMW 3 Series]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwplant.co.za/Content/frame_content.jsp@content=http-3a-2f-2fhaf0gau02~5.htm |title=BMW South Africa - Plant Rosslyn |publisher=Bmwplant.co.za |date= |accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> the BMW 325is which was powered by an Alpina derived 2.7 litre engine, and the [[BMW E23|E23]] M745i, which used the engine from the [[BMW M1]].

Unlike U.S. manufacturers, such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]], which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa.

Following the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3-Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to [[right hand drive]] markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, [[Singapore]], and Hong Kong, as well as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in [[left hand drive]] for export to [[Taiwan]], the United States and [[Iran]], as well as South America.

BMW's with a [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] number starting with "NC0" are manufactured in South Africa.

===United States===

===India===
BMW established in 2006 a sales subsidiary in [[Gurgaon]] (National Capital Region) and a state-of-the-art assembly plant for BMW 3 and 5 Series started operation in early 2007 in [[Chennai]]. The construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started fullfledged operation in the first quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants of [[BMW 3 Series]] and [[BMW 5 Series]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Interone Worldwide GmbH |url=http://www.bmw.in/in/en/index_narrowband.html |title=International BMW website |publisher=Bmw.in |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref>
