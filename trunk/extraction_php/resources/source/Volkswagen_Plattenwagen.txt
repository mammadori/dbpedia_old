The '''Volkswagen Plattenwagen''' was never sold to the public, and was only used by the [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|Volkswagen factory]] in [[Wolfsburg]] as a parts runabout.

When Dutch [[Volkswagen]] importer [[Ben Pon]] visited the Wolfsburg factory in 1947, he spotted a Plattenwagen based on the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].  This gave him the idea for a Volkswagen commercial, the future [[Volkswagen Transporter|Transporter]].
