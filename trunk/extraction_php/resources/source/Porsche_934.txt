The '''Porsche 934''' was a racing version of the [[Porsche 930|Porsche 911 Turbo]], prepared to [[FIA]] [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] rules, similar to the [[Porsche 935]] which was prepared to [[FIA]] [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] rules.

==History==
The [[Porsche]] 934 was introduced for the 1976 racing season. It was manufactured for two years, 1976 and 1977, with at least 400 being manufactured. [[Toine Hezemans]] drove this car to victory at the [[European GT Championship]], while in the [[United States|U.S.]], with [[George Follmer]] at the wheel, it also became the [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am]] champion. It continued to win races throughout the late 1970s.

The 934 as well as the 935 were raced in the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]] in a distinctive orange "[[Jägermeister]]" livery.

Alan Hamilton the Australian Porsche distributor at the owned one of these cars and competed and won the 1977 [[Australian Sports Car Championship]] and in 1980 the same car won the title with [[Allan Moffat]] behind the wheel

==Details==
The 934 has a top speed approaching 190 mph (approximately 300&nbsp;km/h) and has a 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 3.9 seconds.  It was also one of the last designs to incorporate all the distinctive stylings of the original 911's, with only minor bodywork taken from the [[911 Turbo]], to include [[Glass-reinforced plastic|GRP]] (glass-reinforced plastic) wheelarch extensions, doors, engine lid and boot.

The car came in a Regular Trim, or a Racing Trim (also called Group 4 Trim).
Regular Trim:
* {{convert|1090|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}
* Electric windows and door trim
* 32 gallon gas tank.{{Clarifyme|us or imnp?|date=February 2009}}
* {{convert|480|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3 litre engine  (in 1977, modifications took it to 550 bhp)

The Racing Trim was a modified Regular Trim to meet with the FIA rules, most notably it added {{convert|30|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} of weight, so that it complied with the minimum weight requirement of Group 4.
