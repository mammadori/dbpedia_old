'''Hanomag''' (Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG) was a [[Germany|German]] producer of steam locomotives, tractors, trucks and military vehicles. Hanomag first achieved international fame by delivering a large number of steam locomotives to [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] before World War I.

==History==
The company dates back to 1835 when Georg Egestorff founded a company called Eisen-Giesserei und Maschinenfabrik Hannover to build small [[steam engine]]s. They soon started making [[farm machinery]] and in 1846 built their first [[railway locomotive]] for the Hannover State Railways. By 1870 they had made 500 locomotives and in 1871 changed their name to Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG. [[Road vehicle]]s followed when in 1905 they received a contract for [[steam waggon]]s for the German army.

Petrol engined vehicles followed in 1912 with a line of [[farm]] [[tractor]]s.

===Cars===
By the 1920s, the market for steam road vehicles was in terminal decline and Hanomag looked to cars as the future, particularly economy models. In 1925, they launched the [[Hanomag 2 / 10 PS|Hanomag 2/10]], a {{convert|370|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} open two seater with a rear-mounted 500cc<ref>Georgano, G. N. ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)</ref> single-cylinder water cooled engine. Named ''Zweisitzer Limousine'' (two-seat limousine)<ref>Georgano.</ref> by the company, its rounded front and rear gained it the nickname ''Kommissbrot'' for its resemblance to a loaf of Army bread. Although made in large numbers, 15,775 in total, it did not make much money for the company and in the late 1920s the railway locomotive division was sold to [[Henschel & Son]] of Kassel.

A more conventional car, the 3/16PS, and the first diesel engined tractors, came in 1928, taking the company back into profit. Hanomag were badly hurt by the drop in trade in 1929 and built a large stock of unsold vehicles. Things improved in 1930 and the company got 14 per cent of the domestic car market, second place behind [[Opel]], but in 1931 a new crisis came when the banks called a loan. The factory was mortgaged to Hannover City and the [[Vereinigte Stahlwerke]] trust and the company relaunched as '''Hanomag Automobil und Schlepperbau GmbH'''.

For 1932, a new small car, the 1.1 Litre, renamed the ''Garant'' in 1934, was announced and sold well allowing two shift working to be introduced and it was joined by the larger 1.5 litre '''Rekord''' (a name later used by Opel) in 1933 with independent front suspension. A diesel Rekord was shown at the 1936 Berlin Motor Show.

===Military vehicles===
During [[World War II]] , the car plant made military vehicle engines, a military version of their heavy tractor renamed the SS-100, and [[SdKfz 251|half track troop carriers]]. Hanomag 20 B, a 4-wheel-drive Small Unit-Personell Carrier was produced 1937-1940 (ca. 2000) under the parentage of [[Stoewer]]. Capacity problems by Stoewer resulted in co-production by both [[BMW]] and Hanomag. Together the three manufacturers made ca. 10.000 units. The special 4-wheel-steering system was fitted on most models. Operating a "lock-level" between the front seats made the steerable rear axle turn sideways to a certain angle. Post war production resumed making trailer units followed by tractors and in 1949 a 1.5 ton truck. Although prototypes were made, no cars were produced postwar. Rudolph Hiller, who had been president of [[Phänomen]] trucks, joined the board and restructured the company by arranging for it to join the [[Rheinstahl]] consortium in 1952.

===Merger & Split===
In 1964, [[Rheinstahl]] took over Henschel & Son and in a reverse of history the company was merged with Hanomag. 

The farm tractor operation was sold to [[Massey Ferguson]] and in 1969 the truck making division of Hanomag-Henschel went to [[Daimler Benz]], leaving the Hannover works making earth-moving machinery for Massey Ferguson. 

In 1989, the world's second largest construction machine manufacturer, [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]], bought a share of  Hanomag AG and since 2002 Komatsu Hanomag GmbH has been a 100% daughter of the global company.

===Construction machinery===
In Hanover, the company is producing wheel loaders ranging from 54 to {{convert|353|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and since 2005 also has been producing wheeled excavators from 14 to 22 tons. Thanks to the European Technical Center (EUTC), these correspond to the latest state of technology. In Hanover, the company develops construction machines which meet varied requirements of customers all over Europe as well as for certain products also worldwide.

==Financial data==
During the last fiscal year, the number of machines produced increased from 2500 to 3900. In the previous fiscal year, the turnover amounted to 356 million Euros, 62% over the year before. Komatsu Hanomag hired around 300 new employees during the last year; counting 268 temporary employees, around 1170 people were employed at Komatsu Hanomag at the end of last fiscal year. This is twice as many as at the end of the business year 2005, when around 650 people were employed here.
