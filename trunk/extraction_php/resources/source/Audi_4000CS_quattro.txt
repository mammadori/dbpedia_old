The '''Audi 4000 quattro''' (sometimes written as '''4Kq''', '''4000 CSq''' or '''4K CSq''') was a passenger car, manufactured by [[Audi]] of [[Germany]] from 1984 to 1987.  In Europe, these cars were sold as the '''Audi 80 quattro''' or the '''Audi 90 quattro''', names that were also adopted in the American market a few years later.

The 4000 quattro was only available with Audi's 'trademark' a [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.  There were lock-up controls for the centre and rear [[differential (mechanical device)|differentials]].  1984 and 1985 [[United States|US]] models, and all Canadian models were badged "4000 S", 1986 and 1987 US models were badged "4000 CS".

The 4000 quattro was a car with "multiple personalities".  It was a four-[[vehicle door|door]], five-passenger luxury [[Europe]]an saloon/sedan, although it had the spirit of a [[sports car]] (in the [[internal combustion engine|engine]], [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and [[car handling|handling]]).  With its lockable centre and rear differentials, it gave the car true [[four-wheel drive]] traction capabilities.

==Powertrain==
The 4000 quattro had a CIS-E fuel-injected 2.22&nbsp;[[litre]] [[straight-five engine|inline 5-cylinder]] [[petrol engine]] (identification code: JT).  It displaced {{convert|2226|cc|1|lk=on}}, was constructed from a [[gray iron|grey]] [[cast iron]] [[cylinder block]], with an [[aluminium alloy]] [[cylinder head]], and used a [[timing belt]]-driven [[overhead camshaft#single overhead camshaft|single overhead camshaft]] (SOHC).  The cylinder bore is {{convert|81.0|mm|2|lk=on}}, and the piston stroke is {{convert|86.4|mm|2}}, and it's [[compression ratio]] is 8.5:1.  The rated horsepower is {{convert|86|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 5,500&nbsp;rpm, and the torque is {{convert|171|Nm|0|lk=on}} at 3,000&nbsp;rpm.

The only [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] available on the 4000S/CS was a five-speed close-ratio [[manual transmission|manual]].  An [[automatic transmission]] was not available.

==Styling and features==
On the exterior, the 4000 quattro was designed{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} to look like a luxury [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]].  The door handles have stainless steel inserts to match the body moulding, and clearcoat [[metallic paint]] was an option.

The interior was designed{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} to have "sport" appointments.  Although the [[car seat|seats]] were plush and comfortable, the dash area was "sport" style: tab-rocker component switches, red instrument lighting, sport steering wheel, ''et cetera''.

The 4000 quattro had several standard features which were advanced and/or fancy in the mid [[1980s]] - such as power side mirrors with defoggers, [[cruise control]] with resume function, [[air conditioning]], and [[power window]]s.

The 4000 quattro had some stylish touches - one in particular being the word "quattro" written on the rear windshield in defroster wire.  The word was visible from the outside, and it also appeared in the rear-view mirror (reading in the appropriate direction obviously, due to the double-reversal).  This feature was continued with the later [[Audi 80]]/90 quattro models.

===Options===
Options included:
*Clearcoat metallic paint 
*Leather interior 
*Power tilt-and-slide [[sunroof]]
*6-function trip information computer
*Multi-level heated front seats
*Upgraded all-weather [[tires|tyres]]
