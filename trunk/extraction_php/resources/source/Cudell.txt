The '''Cudell''' was a [[Germany|German]] car made from 1898 to 1908.  It was made in [[Aachen]] until 1905, and thenceforth in [[Berlin]].

Max Cudell founded the company in 1898 to manufacture [[license]]d [[De Dion-Bouton]] vehicles.  The original 3-wheelers  were succeeded by a 3.5[[hp]] [[voiturette]].  These were followed by more De Dion-style vehicles until 1904.  In that year, Karl Slevogt-designed vehicles premiered with little, if any, resemblance to the former French-influenced models.  These new cars featured an advanced 4-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] engine that had a 5-[[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] [[crankshaft]] and [[overhead valve]]s.  Versions of the engines ranged from 16/20[[Horsepower#PS|PS]] to a 6.1[[litre|L]] 35/40PS.  The Berlin branch was headed by Paul Cudell and did not make many cars.  After auto manufacture was stopped, the company continued to manufacture marine engines, as well as a [[carburetor]] of the same name.
