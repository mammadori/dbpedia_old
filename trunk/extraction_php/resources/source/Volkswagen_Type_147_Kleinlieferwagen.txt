==History==
The [[Deutsche Post|German Postal Services]] commissioned in 1961 / 1963 [[Volkswagen]] to design them a postal van that would suit their needs.

VW started off with the [[Karmann]] produced (Type 151) Beetle Cabriolet as basis for the van due to its strength in build but later turned to the Karmann Ghia (Type 14) for basis as it was wider.

It was agreed Franz Knobel & Sohn GmbH (later called [[Westfalia|Westfalia Werke]]) would build the vehicles for VW & the [[Deutsche Post]], Swiss Post Offices & [[Lufthansa]].

Its official name was '''Volkswagen Type 147 Kleinlieferwagen''' (small van) but due to its funny and badly proportioned shape it was affectionately called "Fridolin".  From 1964 to July 1974, 6139 were produced.
