'''Dorothea Lange''' (May 26, 1895 &ndash; October 11, 1965) was an influential [[United States|American]] documentary [[photographer]] and [[photojournalist]], best known for her [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era work for the  [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA). Lange's photographs humanized the tragic consequences of the Great Depression and profoundly influenced the development of [[documentary photography]].

==Biography==
Born '''Dorothea Nutzhorn''' in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] on May 26, 1895, she was the daughter of Joan Lange and Henry Nutzhorn.<ref name=enc>Lurie, Maxine N. and Mappen, Marc. ''Encyclopedia of New Jersey''. 2004, page 455</ref><ref name=vau>Vaughn, Stephen L. ''Encyclopedia of American Journalism''. 2008, page 254</ref> Dorothea developed [[polio]] in [[1902]], at age 7. Like many other polio victims before treatment was available, she emerged with a weakened right leg, and a permanent limp.<ref name=vau /> When she was 12 years old, her father abandoned her and her mother, leading her to drop her middle and last names and adopt her mother's maiden name.<ref name=enc /><ref name=vau />

Lange was educated in photography in [[New York City]], in a class taught by [[Clarence H. White]]. She was informally apprenticed to several New York photography studios, including that of the famed [[Arnold Genthe]]. In 1918, she moved to [[San Francisco]], and by the following year she had opened a successful portrait studio.<ref name=vau /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/picturing_the_century/text/port_lange_text.html |title=Dorothea Lange |accessdate=2008-06-29 |quote=Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, Dorothea Lange (1895-1965) announced her intention to become a photographer at age 18.

In 1920, she married the noted western painter [[Maynard Dixon]], with whom she had two sons.<ref name="profile">{{cite news |title=Dorothea Lange: Photographer of the People |accessdate=2007-06-17 |last=Oliver |first=Susan |date=2003-12-07 |}}</ref> One, born in 1925, was named Daniel Rhoades Dixon. The second child, born in 1929, was named John Eaglesfeather Dixon.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], Lange turned her camera lens from the studio to the street. Her studies of unemployed and homeless people captured the attention of local photographers and led to her employment with the federal [[Resettlement Administration]] (RA), later called the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA). 

In December 1935, she divorced Dixon and married agricultural economist [[Paul Schuster Taylor]], Professor of Economics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="profile"/> Taylor educated Lange in social and political matters, and together they documented rural poverty and the exploitation of [[sharecroppers]] and migrant laborers for the next five years &mdash; Taylor interviewing and gathering economic data, Lange taking photos.  

From 1935 to 1939, Lange's work for the RA and FSA brought the plight of the poor and forgotten &mdash; particularly sharecroppers, displaced farm families, and migrant workers &mdash; to public attention. Distributed free to newspapers across the country, her poignant images became icons of the era.

[[Image:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Lange's 1936, ''Migrant Mother'', [[Florence Owens Thompson]]]]
Lange's best-known picture is titled "Migrant Mother". The woman in the photo is [[Florence Owens Thompson]]. The original photo featured Florence's thumb and index finger on the tent pole, but the image was later retouched to hide Florence's thumb. Her index finger was left untouched (lower right in photo).  

In 1960, Lange spoke about her experience taking the photograph:

:''I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother, as if drawn by a magnet. I do not remember how I explained my presence or my camera to her, but I do remember she asked me no questions. I made five exposures, working closer and closer from the same direction. I did not ask her name or her history. She told me her age, that she was thirty-two. She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields, and birds that the children killed. She had just sold the tires from her car to buy food. There she sat in that lean-to tent with her children huddled around her, and seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she helped me. There was a sort of equality about it.''

According to Thompson's son, Lange got some details of this story wrong, but the impact of the picture was based on the image showing the strength and need of migrant workers.<ref name="newtimes">{{cite news | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20020602103656/http://www.newtimes-slo.com/archives/cov_stories_2002/cov_01172002.html#top | title=Photographic license | first=Geoffrey | last=Dunne | publisher=[[New Times]] | date=2002}}</ref>

[[Image:JapaneseAmericanGrocer1942.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Japanese American unfurled this banner the day after the Pearl Harbor attack; Lange photographed it in March 1942, just prior to the man's internment.]]
In 1941, Lange was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for excellence in photography. After the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], she gave up the prestigious award to record the forced evacuation of [[Japanese Americans]] to relocation camps, on assignment for the [[War Relocation Authority]] (WRA). She covered the [[Japanese American internment|rounding up of Japanese Americans]] and their internment in relocation camps, highlighting [[Manzanar]], the first of the permanent internment camps. To many observers, her photograph of Japanese-American children pledging allegiance to the flag shortly before they were sent to internment camps is a haunting reminder of this policy of detaining people without charging them with any crime or affording them any appeal.<ref>Davidov, Judith Fryer. ''Women's Camera Work''. 1998, page 280</ref>

Her images were so obviously critical that the Army impounded them. Today her photographs of the internment are available in the National Archives on the website of the Still Photographs Division, and at the Bancroft Library of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

In 1945, Lange was invited by [[Ansel Adams]] to accept a position as faculty at the first fine art photography department at the [[San Francisco Art Institute|California School of Fine Arts]] (CSFA). [[Imogen Cunningham]] and [[Minor White]] joined as well.<ref>[http://www.verlang.com/sfbay0004ref_timeline_05.html Vernacular Language North. SF Bay Area Timeline. ''Modernism (1930-1960)'']</ref>

In 1952, Lange co-founded the photographic magazine ''[[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]]''. Lange and [[Pirkle Jones]] were commissioned in the mid-1950s to shoot a photographic documentary for [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] of the death of [[Monticello, California]] and of the displacement of its residents by the damming of [[Putah Creek]] to form [[Lake Berryessa]]. The magazine did not run the piece, so Lange devoted one whole issue of ''Aperture'' to the work. The photo collection was shown at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1960.<ref>BellaVistaRanch.net. Suisun History. Nancy Dingler, [http://www.bellavistaranch.net/suisun_history/berryessa3-dingler.html ''Part 3 - Fifty years since the birth of the Monticello Dam''.] Retrieved on August 17, 2009.</ref>

In the last two decades of her life, Lange's health was poor. She suffered from gastric problems, including bleeding [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], as well as [[post-polio syndrome]] &mdash; although this renewal of the pain and weakness of polio was not yet recognized by most physicians.

==Death==
Lange died of [[esophageal cancer]] on [[October 11]], [[1965]], age 70.<ref name="profile"/><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dorothea Lange Is Dead at 70.

==Legacy==
In 1972 the Whitney Museum used 27 of Lange's photographs in an exhibit entitled Executive Order 9066.  This exhibit highlighted the Japanese Internment during World War II.

California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and First Lady [[Maria Shriver]] announced on [[May 28]], 2008 that Lange will be inducted into the [[California Hall of Fame]], located at [[The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts]]. The induction ceremony took place on December 15 and her son accepted the honor in her place.
