1889 Hebmüller & Sohn a coachbuilding firm is established in the town of [[Wuppertal]], [[Germany]].  After [[World War II]] Hebmüller & Sohn like most German companies of the time lacked business.  During this time Major [[Ivan Hirst]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME) was running [[Volkswagen]]. 

After talks with Colonel Michael McEvoy about a sport car based [[Beetle]], Ivan asked Ringel's experimental team to build the Colonel in charge of [[Volkswagen]], Charles Radcliffye, a 2-seat [[Convertible|Cabriolet]].

The Radclyffe Cabriolet as it is known in VW circles obviously influenced Joseph Hebmüller II on his frequent trips to the [[Wolfsburg]] plant.  The '''Type 14A''' took many elements of the Radclyffe Cabriolet his company would later build.

At the request of [[Volkswagen]] Managing Director [[Heinz Nordhoff]], Hebmüller and [[Karmann]] would build Cabriolets for Volkswagen, with as many Beetle parts as possible eg chassis, panels & engines etc.  Hebmüller was to build the 2 + 2 seat Cabriolet and [[Karmann]] the 4 seat Cabriolet based on the Beetle (Type 1).

In April 1949 the Type 14A passed a {{Convert|10000|km|mi|0}} rough road test by [[Volkswagen]] engineers, pleased with the results [[Heinz Nordhoff]] ordered 2000 productions versions to be sold by Volkswagen through its agents.

Hebmüller started production in June 1949, mechanically the Type 14A was the same as the Beetle sedan with mechanical brakes and the Beetles {{Convert|25|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine.

Retailing for 7500 Deustch Marks, the Hebmüller Cabriolet was available in a variety of colours, options were
black, red & white in single tone, in two tone combinations black & red, black & ivory, black & yellow and red & ivory was available, for extra charge buyers could choose their own combination.

The Type 14A was sold and serviced through Volkswagen agencies on the Geman market, and through private importers in foreign markets.

Tragedy was to strike the [[Wuppertal]] factory, a fire broke out on the 23rd of July 1949 in the paint department and made its way to the production line.  After the fire, Hebmüller did manage to produce later but later became financially ruined in the early 1950s.  Production of Type 14A was moved to the [[Karmann]] factory in [[Osnabrück]], [[Germany]] in 1952.

Production ended in 1953 with a total of 696 units produced including 3 prototypes and 1 pre-production models, today around 100 are thought to be in existence.
