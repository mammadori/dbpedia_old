'''Christian Abt''' (born [[8 May]] [[1967]]) is a successful [[race car]] [[driving|driver]] born in [[Kempten]], [[Germany]], into a family of amateur race drivers and car dealers.

His elder brother Hans-Jürgen Abt runs the [[Abt Sportsline]] [[Audi]] racing teams as well as their tuning company for Audi and Volkswagen.

Christian Abt started his career in [[motocross]] before moving on to German [[Formula BMW]], becoming the 1991 champion. 

In 1992 he won the [[German Formula Three Championship]].

Driving a privately entered Audi A4 with the [[quattro]] 4-Wheel-Drive as this was banned for factory entrants, he won the [[Super Tourenwagen Cup|German Supertouring Championship]] (STW) in 1999, the last season of this series, under controversial circumstances, taking the title only after the STW annulled the last lap of the final round of the Nürburgring. 

Still considered as privateers, Abt entered the new [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] with hastily built cars similar to [[Audi TT]]. When driving an [[Audi R8 Race Car|Audi R8]] for [[Joest Racing]] at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] that year, Abt called no other than [[Roland Asch]] to step in.
