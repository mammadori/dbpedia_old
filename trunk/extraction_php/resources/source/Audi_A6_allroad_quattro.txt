The first generation allroad shares its platform with the second generation "C5" [[Audi A6]] [[executive car]], and its rear end is almost identical to the A6 Avant, the [[station wagon|estate]] version.  The main differences are an advanced [[suspension (vehicle)|air suspension]] system, larger wheels with all-terrain tyres, and flared and unpainted [[bumper (automobile)|bumper]]s, giving it a distinct appearance and more overall flexibility over varying terrain.

Audi's trademark [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system is standard equipment for all versions.

===Off-road capabilities===
The allroad was designed with the capability to tackle rough road conditions in mind; its standard adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide {{convert|208|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of ground clearance and a low-range mode, absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button.   When used in conjunction, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official [[Land Rover]] test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing.

Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only {{convert|142|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional [[Audi A6|A6]] with the sports suspension.

===Engines===
Audi's 2.7&nbsp;L, [[turbocharger|twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine|V6]] [[gasoline engine]] with {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} of power and {{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of peak torque was available initially, alongside the 2.5&nbsp;L TDI diesel unit with 132&nbsp;kW (180&nbsp;PS) and 370&nbsp;Nm (273&nbsp;ft·lbf) torque.  A variant of the corporate 4.2&nbsp; [[V8]] gasoline engine, shared with the Audi S4 (B6/B7), was made available in 2003, and a less powerful TDI (163&nbsp;bhp) followed in 2004.

===Sales===
Despite this versatility and generally positive word of mouth from owners and magazine reviews, allroad sales failed expectations in the North American market for which it was originally intended.  Oddly, most of its sales came from Europe, especially its native Germany.  Its somewhat high price, lack of market identity in its segment and Audi's ambiguous advertising seem to have been the primary contributing factors; buyers who tend to normally seek either the more car-like look and ride of station wagons or the larger, less ambiguous styling of [[sport utility vehicle]]s tended to reject the allroad as being too little like either.

Sales had a slight increase in 2004, due to the availability of the less expensive Diesel engine, but fell again in 2005.  Audi stopped production of the allroad in July of that year.  Although the model continued to be available for sale throughout 2006 in Europe, there was no 2006 model year for North America.

Audi announced the second generation allroad in the spring of 2005 and released it in the summer of 2006.  This new model is called the '''Audi A6 allroad quattro''' (unlike the previous version, which was merely called ''Audi allroad quattro'', with no reference to the A6 nomenclature).

The car features again adaptive air suspension and new{{Clarify me|what is "new"?|date=April 2009}} [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.  The A6 allroad is powered by a choice of two [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) [[petrol engine]]s, a 3.2&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]] and a 4.2&nbsp;L [[V8 engine|V8]], and two [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] [[diesel engine]]s, a 180&nbsp;PS (132&nbsp;kW) 2.7&nbsp;L and a 233&nbsp;PS (171&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;L.  The [[tiptronic]] gearbox is standard on the 4.2 V8 and the 2.7 TDI, but optional on the 3.2 FSI and 3.0 TDI.  The new 6-speed tiptronic transmission system converts high-torque engine power into both sporty performance and operating convenience, with crisp, fast gear changes.  Advanced electronics respond efficiently to all driver input in both D (Drive) and S (Sport) programmes, helping to prevent unwanted upshifts when cornering.  The five-mode air suspension can be raised by up to 60&nbsp;mm to provide [[ground clearance]] of 185&nbsp;mm which is better than the older four-mode.  The car features a number of off-road styling cues including larger bumpers and sills.  

In some European markets, the new A6 allroad quattro is more expensive than the larger [[Audi Q7]], but air suspension is an expensive option in the Q7.  In its native country, Germany, it costs a few hundred Euros less than the Q7.

The second generation is currently not available in [[North America]].
