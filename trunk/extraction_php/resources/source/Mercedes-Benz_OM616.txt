==The OM616 in India==

In 1982, [[Bajaj Tempo]], now [[Force Motors]], signed a deal with [[Daimler Benz]] to manufacture the OM616 Mercedes engine under licence in India for fitting on its line of vehicles. This Mercedes engine gave the company a technological edge over other Indian manufacturers leading to the success of several Bajaj Tempo models. 

The Mercedes OM 616 or its variants still power the light commercial vehicles of Bajaj Tempo, including the tempo traveller, the new Excel series of trucks and the Trax range of multi-utility vehicles. At present, Bajaj Tempo is also assembling other Mercedes engines and supplying it to Mercedes Benz India Ltd.

The Bajaj Tempo OM616 engine is configured for different power outputs depending on the intended usage, from a 65BHP version, to the 91BHP [[Turbo]] charged version used in the Trax Gurkha (Which is loosely based on the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Gel√§ndewagen]] design)
