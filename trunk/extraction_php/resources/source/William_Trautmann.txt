'''William Ernst Trautmann''' was founding [[General Secretary|General-Secretary]] of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) and one of six people who initially laid plans for the organization in 1904.

He was born to German parents in [[New Zealand]] in 1869 and raised in Europe. After completing a brewing apprenticeship in Poland, he worked as a masterbrewer in [[Germany]] before being expelled for labor activities. In 1890 he moved to the United States, where he joined the Brewers Union. Trautmann was a key figure in the [[International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink and Distillery Workers|United Brewery Workers' Union]] in [[Milwaukee]] and the editor of the United Brewery Workers' German-language newspaper, Brauer Zeitung. He was expelled from that union for his participation in the founding IWW convention. In 1905 he joined with other industrial unionists to found the Industrial Workers of the World. Between 1905 and 1912 he mostly worked in the field as an organizer. In 1912 he broke with the IWW leadership over strike tactics and the alleged misuse of funds collected for the "Bread and Roses" Strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

In 1922 he published a novel, ''[[Riot (novel)|Riot]]'', drawing on his experiences as an IWW activist during the [[Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909]] in [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania|McKees Rocks]] ([[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]).
