The '''AWZ P70 "Zwickau"'''  was a car made in East Germany by ''VEB Automobilwerke Zwickau (AWZ)'' between 1955 and 1958. After 1958 AWZ was united with the former Horch factory to the [[HQM Sachsenring GmbH|VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau]] and called ''Sachsenring P70''.

It succeeded the ''[[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau|IFA]] F8'' using the same 684&nbsp;cc two cylinder, [[two-stroke]] engine but with a completely new [[fibreglass|glass fibre]] body. An estate version was introduced in 1956 followed by a coupé in 1957.

It was replaced by the [[Trabant]] P50 in 1959 after about 36,000 had been made.
The total output of AWZ P70 was 36,151 cars.
