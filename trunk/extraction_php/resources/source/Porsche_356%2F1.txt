The '''Porsche 356/1''' was the first ''real'' [[Porsche]] car created by [[Ferry Porsche|Ferdinand "Ferry" Porsche]]. This prototype car was a two-seater open roadster with a mid-mounted, air-cooled [[flat-4]] engine of 1,131 cc displacement that produced {{convert|40|hp}}. While the body was an original design, most of the mechanicals (including engine and suspension) were derived from the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] which Ferry's father, [[Ferdinand Porsche]], had designed. 

The [[aluminum]] [[roadster]] body of the 356/1 was designed by Porsche employee [[Erwin Komenda]] in April 1948 at [[Gmünd]] and completed only a month later. Smooth and low, the 356/1 set the pattern for later [[Porsche 356|356s]] with one fundamental difference; the engine of the production cars was moved behind the rear axle (to reduce costs and make room for two additional seats). The car was registered by the state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (''Kärnten'') with the [[Vehicle registration plate|license plate]] K45-286 and made its maiden voyage on June 8, 1948.
