The '''Audi Pikes Peak quattro''' was a [[sport utility vehicle]] [[concept car]].  It was created by [[Germany|German]] premium [[automobile]] manufacturer, [[Audi]].<ref>{{PDF|[http://www.audi.com/etc/medialib/cms4imp/audi2/company/financial_information/pdf.Par.0103.File.pdf Audi 2003 Product Strategy - indicating Audi Pikes Peak quattro detail (p.13)]|1.50&nbsp;MB}} - </ref><ref>[http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z6661/Audi_Pikes%20Peak%20Quattro/default.aspx Audi Pikes Peak quattro info, from ConceptCarz.com]</ref>  The Pikes Peak quattro was first introduced at the 2003 [[North American International Auto Show]].  It was the first of three concept cars designed by [[Audi]] and shown in 2003, ahead of the [[Audi Nuvolari quattro|Nuvolari quattro]] and the [[Audi Le Mans quattro|Le Mans quattro]].

The Pikes Peak quattro was named after the famed [[hillclimbing]] course, [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb|Pikes Peak]] in the Rocky Mountains, which they had taken overall wins and broken records during the 1980s, due to the off-road capability of their "quattro" cars.

The Pikes Peak quattro design was subsequently developed into the production [[Audi Q7]].

==Engine, performance, and design==
The Pikes Peak quattro uses a [[twin-turbo]]charged 4.2 L [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) [[V8 engine]].  This develops {{convert|368|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} and {{convert|630|Nm|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] from 2000&nbsp;rpm, and features [[overhead camshaft|DOHC]] (two per cylinder bank) with 5 valves per cylinder.

Engine output is transmitted through a 6-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]], complete with [[steering wheel]] mounted paddle shifters.  [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four wheel drive]] system is also standard.

Acceleration is 0-{{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds, while the top speed is electronically limited to {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

The Pikes Peak quattro is well-suited for off-road use with its high ride height, adaptive air suspension, [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four wheel drive]], and power [[rack and pinion]] steering.
