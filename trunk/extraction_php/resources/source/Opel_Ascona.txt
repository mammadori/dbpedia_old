The '''Opel Ascona''' was a [[mid-size car|mid-sized]] [[automobile|car]] produced by [[Opel]], the [[Germany|German]] subsidiary of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]. It had three generations produced from 1970 to 1988. In motorsport, the Ascona 400 rally car driven by [[Walter Röhrl]] won the [[World Rally Championship]] [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|drivers' title]] in the [[1982 World Rally Championship season|1982 season]].

In the fall of 1970, Opel presented its completely new vehicle range in Rüsselsheim (internal project code 1.450). The [[Opel Manta]] [[coupé]] was launched on September 9, followed by the Opel Ascona on October 28 in two and four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] forms, plus a three-door [[station wagon]], called the Caravan or Voyage. These models were positioned between the existing [[Opel Kadett]] and the [[Opel Rekord]].

[[Image:Opel Ascona - 2008 Rallye Deutschland.jpg|thumb|left|Ascona A driven during the [[2008 Rallye Deutschland]].]]The Opel Ascona was developed to as a competitor to the successful [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] mid-sized car, the [[Ford Taunus|Taunus]]. The Opel Ascona A stayed in production until 1975. By that time, almost 692,000 vehicles of the first series had been produced.

The range featured petrol engines from 1.2&nbsp;L to 1.9&nbsp;L, with power between 60&nbsp;PS (44&nbsp;kW) and 90&nbsp;PS (66&nbsp;kW). The 1.2&nbsp;L had an [[overhead valve]](OHV) head, while the 1.6&nbsp;L and 1.9&nbsp;L featured a camshaft in head (CIH) type of engine. All used a single barrel [[carburetor]]. Even with this simple design, the Ascona 1.9 SR had a successful career in motorsports, with [[Walter Rohrl]] winning the [[European Rally Championship]] in 1974. Tuner [[Steinmetz]] developed a special version of the Ascona SR, with two single-barrel Solex carburettors, lifting power to 125&nbsp;PS (92&nbsp;kW).

From 1971-75, the 1.9-liter Ascona was exported as the "Opel 1900" to the United States, sold through [[Buick]] dealerships as the Buick-Opel. Initially, all three body styles were offered but the 4-door was dropped after 1973; the year later, heavy rubber-clad impact bumpers were added in response to Federal regulations. All Opels sold in the US in 1975 were equipped with [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] K-[[Jetronic]] [[fuel injection]], which was not available on the European versions. The fuel injection was added because of the more strict emissions requirements that were in force that year. Due to the unfavorable DMark/US Dollar exchange rate, after 1975, all Opels in Buick showrooms were replaced by [[Isuzu Gemini]] models wearing Opel badges.

The second generation Opel Ascona B was presented in the 1975 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. It was available as a two or four-door sedan. There were related two and three-door coupé models in the Opel Manta range. There was no estate body.

The Ascona B retained the same engine range as its predecessor, although the 1.9&nbsp;L was increased to 2.0&nbsp;L in 1978, and versions with higher [[compression ratio]] and needing 98 octane gas, dubbed S, were available alongside the 90 octane models. The 2.0 E model had a Bosch L-Jetronic electronic [[fuel injection]], and a 2.0&nbsp;L [[Diesel engine|diesel]] motor was added to the Ascona B range in 1978.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] badge was used on both [[sedan (car)|saloon]] and coupé models, which came out of the same factory in [[Belgium]]—the first Vauxhall to be built abroad. The front ends were different, featuring Vauxhall's trademark "droop snoot", as designed by [[Wayne Cherry]].

A version of the Ascona B, featuring the front end of the Manta B, was sold in [[South Africa]] as the [[Chevrolet Chevair]]. This was in addition to a '''Chevrolet Ascona''', identical in most respects to the Opel.

Over 1.2 million Ascona B units were produced worldwide until 1981.

===Ascona 400 rally car===
[[Image:Opel Ascona Rallye Rothmans.JPG|thumb|left|The Rothmans Ascona 400 which won the 1983 [[Safari Rally]] in the hands of [[Ari Vatanen]].]]
The reason why many probably remember the Ascona B series well is because of the rally version of the car. Built in 1981, the [[1980 World Rally Championship season|1980]] world champion [[Walter Röhrl]] took the car to victory and won the [[World Rally Championship]] [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|drivers' title]] in the [[1982 World Rally Championship season|1982 season]].

The car was developed by Opel alongside the [[Opel Manta 400|Manta B 400 model]] which consisted of the same changes. Irmscher and Cosworth were hired as partners for the project, Cosworth to deliver a 16 valve double cam crossflow head for the engine, and Irmscher for the exterior and interior styling. Cosworth delivered the heads to Opel and Opel soon discovered a major mistake. The plan was to use the 2,0 litre engine block but this did not produce enough power. Time was running out and Opel badly needed to do something. Opel took the 2,0E block and gave it an overbore, installed larger pistons, other pistonrods, and installed the crankshaft of their 2,3 litre diesel CIH style engine. Results was a 2,4 litre engine. The 2,4 litre engine gave way to some massive power outputs using the 16 valve head. The street versions of the 400 therefore came with {{convert|144|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} engines, using the Bosch fuel injection of the Manta GSi and GT/E series. However in race trim they were delivered putting out some {{convert|230|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, which could be improved further to a staggering {{convert|340|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} + still using normally aspirated engine components.

Irmscher delivered the rally trim for the exterior. Large and widened wings, light weight doors, hood, front wings, rear boot lid and doors were installed keeping the weight down.

In 1984, the [[Audi Quattro]] appeared more powerful than ever and the Ascona 400 was rendered obsolete. But the Ascona 400 still has some remarkable records. The Ascona 400 was the last rear wheel drive rally car to win the drivers world championship, ensuring its place in the motorsports book of history.

==Ascona C==
[[Image:Opel ascona c.jpg|thumb|left|Opel Ascona C 4-door]]
The Ascona C was launched in August 1981 as part of [[General Motors J-body|General Motors' J-car project]].  This was Opel's second [[front-wheel drive]] car since the introduction of the [[Opel Kadett|Kadett D]] in 1979. This car was manufactured in [[Russelsheim]], [[Germany]], [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luton]], [[England]], and was sold in the UK under the name [[Vauxhall Cavalier]].  The Cavalier Coupé was phased out, but the Opel Manta was retained in the UK (the last car to be badged as an Opel in the UK before the brand was phased out there in 1988).  There were no longer sheet metal differences between Opel and Vauxhall models after 1982. The Ascona C won the "Golden Lenkrad" at the end of 1981 and was West Germany's biggest selling car.

[[Image:Ascona C 2 door Ludwigshafen.jpg|right|thumb|Opel Ascona C 2-door]]
The range added an option of a five-door hatchback bodystyle, named CC in a few markets. All engines were now SOHC. The base model was the 1.3&nbsp;L introduced in 1978 in the Ascona B, with 60&nbsp;PS (44&nbsp;kW), followed by a 1.6&nbsp;L with 75&nbsp;PS (55&nbsp;kW). S versions with higher compression ratio had power increased by as much a 20 percent. The top of the line was the sporty GTE model, with [[electronic fuel injection]], pushing power to 130&nbsp;PS (96&nbsp;kW). Diesel power came from an Isuzu-developed block, with 1.6&nbsp;L. [[Catalytic converter]]s were optional in the larger petrol units starting from 1986.

As before, there was no [[station wagon]] version of the Ascona, although Vauxhall in the UK brought in the rear ends of the [[Holden Camira]] wagon and adapted them to the Cavalier.

In [[Brazil]], the Ascona C was sold as a coupé, hatchback and sedan from 1982 to 1996 as [[Chevrolet Monza]] , receiving various facelifts. In [[Colombia]] was sold as sedan from 1987 to 1992.

In [[South Africa]], the Ascona C was sold as a sedan and hatchback from 1982 to 1986, when it was replaced by the sedan version of the [[Opel Kadett|Kadett]], known as the Opel Monza (In Europe, this name was used for a coupé version of the larger [[Opel Senator|Senator]]).

Opel continued to use the Ascona nameplate until the [[Opel Vectra|Vectra]] was launched in 1988, although the Cavalier name was retained by Vauxhall until 1995.
