The '''Arimofa''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[automobile]] manufactured between 1921 and 1922 by ''Ari-Motorfahrzeugbau GmbH'' of [[Plauen]], [[Vogtland]]. 

The company began by producing [[cyclecar]]s with a 12[[Horsepower|hp]] [[Steudel]] [[twin-cylinder]] engine; these were built in limited numbers before Arimofa turned to building [[motorcycle]]s.  Between 1923 and 1925, the same company produced the [[Ari two-stroke motorcycle]].
