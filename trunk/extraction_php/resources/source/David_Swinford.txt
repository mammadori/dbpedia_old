'''David Anthony Swinford''' (born [[June 28]], [[1941]]) is an [[agriculture|agricultural]] consultant from the [[Texas Panhandle]] who is an influential [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/pdf/biodata.pdf | title=David Swinford Biography |publisher=[[Texas House of Representatives]] | date=2008 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-01-18}}</ref> Swinford  represents District 87, which includes [[Carson County, Texas|Carson]], [[Moore County, Texas|Moore]], and [[Sherman County, Texas|Sherman]] counties and populous [[Potter County, Texas|Potter County]].

==Background==

Swinford obtained a [[bachelor of science]] degree in agricultural education from [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. He is married to the former Joyce McCoy (born[[1943]]). They have a son, David C. Swinford (born [[1965]]) of Lubbock, and a daughter, Melissa Rae Swinford (born [[1967]]) of Dumas. Swinford has a brother, Jerry Swinford of Lubbock and a nephew, Van Swinford of Dumas. Another brother, Sammy Allen Swinford, is deceased, as is Swinford's niece, Sheila Swinford Wright (1951-2008) of Lubbock, the daughter of Sammy Swinford.<ref>http://lubbockonline.com/stories/072708/obi_310190962.shtml</ref>

==Political career==
In [[1992]], Swinford won his second election by having defeated the Democrat Bonnie Schomp, 17,897 (54.9 percent) to 14,720 (45.1 percent). The two candidates virtually tied in Potter County, but Swinford's home base in Moore County put him over the top. In [[2002]], Swinford defeated the Democrat Jesse Quackenbush, 17,086 (65.8 percent) to 8,872 (34.2 percent). He was unopposed in [[1994]], [[1996]], [[1998]], [[2000]], [[2004]], and [[2006]].

Swinford's district office is located in [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], the seat of Potter County, and his residence is in [[Dumas, Texas|Dumas]], the seat of Moore County, some fifty miles north of Amarillo. Part of Amarillo is in [[Randall County, Texas|Randall County]] to the south toward [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]]. That area, some 40 percent of Amarillo, is represented by Swinford's Republican colleague, [[John T. Smithee]], also of Amarillo. 

Swinford chairs the House State Affairs Committee and previously headed the Texas House Agriculture & Livestock Committee. 

A leading advocate of [[rural development]], Swinford was first elected to the Texas House in [[1990]]. The Panhandle is a heavily Republican part of Texas: only one Democrat in the Texas House, [[Joseph P. Heflin]] of [[Crosbyton, Texas|Crosbyton]], represents west Texas in the chamber, and no Democrats hail from the Panhandle itself.

==Issues==

Though he is considered a [[conservative]] in the legislature through his support of [[right-to-life]] measures and home schooling -- his grandchildren have been educated at home -- Swinford announced in [[2006]] that he no longer supports the construction of a border [[fence]] to separate Texas from [[Mexico]]. Swinford went to the [[Rio Grande River]] to confer with local officials and observe conditions. He reported that the longstanding free flow of goods and services across the border would be hampered by a fence, which he otherwise claimed would not particularly enhance security.

Other conservatives, such as those in the interest group known as Americans for Prosperity, quarreled with Swinford in [[2007]], when he failed to get out of his State Affairs Committee House Bill 1753, which would have barred such groups as the Texas Association of Counties and the Texas Municipal League from lobbying the legislature with taxpayer dollars.

In [[1999]], Swinford received the Knapp-Porter Award, the highest honor given by the Texas Agricultural Extension Service. The award was presented at [[Texas A&M University]] in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]] to honor Swinford for his support of the Extension Service, which handles the [[4-H]] program, particularly popular in rural areas.
