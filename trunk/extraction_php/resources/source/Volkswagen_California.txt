The '''Volkswagen California''' is based on the [[Volkswagen Transporter (T5)|T5 Multivan]] by [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] (VWCV).  It is the first campervan designed and built in-house by VWCV Special Business Unit, a subsidiary of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles.

==California history==
The "California" name was previously used by  Volkswagen for the [[Westfalia]]-built campervans since 1988. Westfalia was the Official Manufacturer of motorhomes for VW. When the [[Westfalia]] company was bought by [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]] in 2001, VW decided to build and design their own campervan range, based on the legendary [[Volkswagen Transporter|Transporter]] range.

The California launched in August, 2003. In 2004 two design studies were presented at the Caravan Salon in [[Düsseldorf]]: '''California Beach''' and '''California Tramper'''. VWCV expanded the range in 2005 with the California (Multivan/Kombi) Beach, to bridge the gap between the Multivan/Kombi people carriers and the California.

At the 2007 Caravan Salon in Düsseldorf, VWCV launched the new California Beach with pop top bed, as seen in the {{explain|higher specified versions|what does this mean?}} of the California range.<ref>California Beach Poptop picture thread at [http://www.vwwatercooled.org.au/newforum/upload/showthread.php?t=7838 VWwatercooled forum]</ref>
