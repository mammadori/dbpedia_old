The '''Opel Gran Turismo Coupé''', abbreviated as '''Opel GTC''', is an [[Opel]] [[concept car]] which was speculated to be a hypothetical [[Opel Vectra]] [[coupé]].  The GTC premiered at the 77th [[Geneva Motor Show]].  

==Specifications==
The GTC is powered with a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] 2.8&nbsp;L (171&nbsp;cid) [[V6 engine]] from the [[GM_High_Feature_engine#LP9_Turbo|High Feature family]], also used in the standard Vectra, but tuned in the GTC to produce {{convert|300|hp|kW}} and 295&nbsp;[[Foot-pound force|ft-lb]] (400&nbsp;Nm) of [[torque]].  The base and [[floorpan]] come from a [[GM_Epsilon_platform#Epsilon_II|General Motors Epsilon II platform]] but modified for [[all-wheel drive]] to apply the power effectively.  The car was capable of 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mph}} in 6.0 seconds and a top speed of {{convert|250|km/h|mph}}.

The Opel Vectra is due to go out of production.  Design cues of the Opel GTC will be used on the [[Opel Insignia]], which is an upmarket replacement for the Vectra.  However, a coupé version of the Insignia will not be available.
