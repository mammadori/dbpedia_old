'''Adam Opel''' ([[May 9]], [[1837]] – [[September 8]], [[1895]]) was the founder of the [[Germany|German]] [[automobile|car]]-maker [[Opel]].  

Born in the town of [[Rüsselsheim]] near [[Frankfurt]], he began his career in a [[locksmith]] apprenticeship.  He traveled across Europe as a teenager, and became fascinated by [[sewing machines]].  In 1863 he opened a factory in Rüsselsheim to mass-produce these machines.

In 1868, Opel married [[Sophie Marie Scheller]].  They would have five sons: Carl, Wilhelm, Heinrich, Friedrich and Ludwig. All five would eventually become involved in the growing family business.
