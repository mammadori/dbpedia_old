The '''BMW 300''' was a [[microcar]] produced by [[BMW]], featuring a characteristic front-opening door and three wheels. It was a modified version of the [[BMW Isetta|BMW 250 (Isetta)]].

==Overview==
In October 1956, the [[Isetta]] Moto Coupe DeLuxe (sliding-window Isetta) was introduced. The bubble windows were replaced by longer, sliding side windows. The engineers had enlarged the [[single cylinder engine|single cylinder]] to a {{convert|72|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} [[bore (engine)|bore]] and {{convert|73|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} [[stroke (engine)|stroke]], which gave a [[engine displacement|displacement]] of exactly 298&nbsp;cc; at the same time, they raised the [[compression ratio]] from 6.8 to 7.0:1. In this way, the engine now generated {{convert|10|kW|hp|abbr=on}} at 5200&nbsp;rpm, and the torque rose to {{convert|18.4|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 4600&nbsp;rpm. The maximum speed remained at {{convert|85|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, yet there was a marked increase in flexibility, chiefly noticeable on gradients.

In addition to the quest for better performance, there was another reason for the change: it was then still possible to drive the 250&nbsp;cc Isetta with the old Class IV driving licence. Quite a number of Isettas were lovingly maintained by their owners for years and even decades, precisely because they possessed no other licence. On the other hand, from 1956 onwards, first-time drivers had to pass the test for Class III if they wanted to drive a car. True, the Class IV licence continued to be issued, but it was only valid for small motorcycles.

A second, similar reason for fitting the larger engine was the prevailing tax regime. The 250&nbsp;cc engine did not take full advantage of the tax class, which then went up to 300&nbsp;cc.
