The '''Meyers Manx''' [[dune buggy]] was designed by Californian engineer, artist, boat builder and surfer Bruce Meyers. It was produced by his company between [[1964]] and [[1971]]<ref>[http://www.meyersmanx.com/history.shtml Meyers Manx History]</ref>.

The car featured a [[fiberglass]] bodyshell coupled with the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] frame and engine. It is a small car, with a [[wheelbase]] 14 1/4&nbsp;inches shorter than a Beetle for lightness and better maneuverability. For this reason, the car is capable of very quick acceleration and good off-road performance.

The Meyers Manx received widespread recognition when it won the inaugural [[Mexican 1000]] race, the predecessor of the [[Baja 1000]] beating motorcycles, cars and trucks in the process.

Manx-type cars have appeared in several movies, including [[Elvis Presley]] films and the 1968 ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', which contains a lengthy beach-driving scene where a heavily modified Meyers Manx equipped with a [[Chevrolet Corvair engine]] is launched over several dunes.

Approximately 6,000 of the original Meyers Manx dune buggies were produced, but when the design became popular many copies (estimated at a quarter of a million worldwide) were made by other companies. Although already patented, Meyers lost in court to the copiers, the judge rescinding his patent as unpatentable opening the floodgates to the Industry Meyers started. Since then countless ''buggies'' continue to be produced today. Many people recognize this body-type simply as the "[[Dune Buggy]]" or "[[Beach Buggy]]".

In 2000 Bruce Meyers created a resurgence of interest by starting up Meyers Manx Inc. and offering the Classic Manx, signature series limited edition of 100.

In 2002 the Manxter 2+2 and Manxter DualSport were born. These two new models are true to the original design but are sized for a full-length Beetle floor pan. Custom versions for higher power engines and other variations are also available.<ref>[http://www.meyersmanx.com Meyers Manx, Inc.: Home of the Manxter 2+2 and Manxter Dualsport Kits Cars<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

In the Spring of 2009 Bruce Meyers introduced two new short wheelbase models of the car. Named the 'Kick Out' after the last action a surfer performs before reaching the shore it is available in two models so far. The more traditional of the two is an updated version of the original Manx concept brought up to date with a front hinged opening hood, wider fenders and better engine access. The SS version is much more modern with headlights flared into the hood, curved windshield, sculptured rear deck cover and twin roll hoops.
