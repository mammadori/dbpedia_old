The '''Combo''' is a [[panel van]] and [[leisure activity vehicle]] from [[Opel|Opel]], which is branded as a '''[[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]]''', '''[[Holden]]''' and '''[[Chevrolet]]''', depending on the market. A [[pickup truck]] variant, designed in [[Brazil]] is available in South America and southern Africa, but not Europe or (more surprisingly given the popularity of larger "utes") Australia.

The Combos share platforms, vital components and some body panels with contemporary subcompact [[Opel Corsa]]s, which used to be a typical pedigree for such a vehicle. The generations are denoted '''A''' and '''B''' in typical Opel fashion, but Holden applied the codes '''SB''' and '''XC''' respectively, reflecting the relation with SB and XC [[Holden Barina]]s (Opel Corsa B and C, respectively)

The Combo first appeared in 1994, and a second generation model was introduced in 2001. 
The name "Combo" was previously applied to a 3-door panel van body style of [[Opel Kadett#Kadett E|Opel Kadett E]].__NOTOC__

The first generation of Combo, launched in 1994, was derived out of [[Opel Corsa#Opel Corsa B|Opel Corsa B]], launched two years earlier. The front part (up to the [[B-pillar]]) is practically identical with the Corsa (except for the roof spoiler), but the platform (and thus wheelbase and the body in general) is extended to accommodate a tall, boxy cargo compartment, capable of carrying an [[pallet|Europallet]]. The Combo A had symmetrical twin rear doors that opened to the side (rather than a single tailgate). These are counted as a single "door" when referring to the body style as 3-door.

Following the increasing popularity of [[leisure activity vehicle]]s, Opel launched a 5-passenger version of the Combo in 1995, called '''Opel Combo Tour'''. It differed from the panel van version by having the cargo section fitted with side windows and a three-passenger split-folding bench seat.

Although Combo's primary market is Europe, it has also been sold on other continents, in markets where GM traditionally use Opel-derived models. As the [[Azambuja]] GM plant in Portugal is the sole production site of all Combos, all those models were replaced simultaneously with Combo B in 2001.

The second generation was launched in 2001. While most competitors severed their connections with their subcompact brethren, Opel decided to base the vehicle on the Corsa again. The use of subcompact [[GM Gamma platform|Gamma platform]] constrained the overall width of the vehicle. While the general body shape was updated to fashionable "flush" look, the front part (up to the [[A-pillar]]) is shared with the Corsa. Compared to previous generation, the Combo B gained sliding rear side doors (versions with either single passenger side door or double doors are available).

An '''Opel Combo Tour''' version was also introduced, followed by '''Opel Combo Tour Tramp''' (Combo Tour Arizona in some markets), in an attempt to attract [[leisure activity vehicle]] buyers. Combo Tour Tramp/Arizona was thought as a more off-road recreational vehicle. It features enhanced suspension tuning, increased ground clearance, chassis protection covers and numerous styling details that differentiate it from standard Combo Tours, with the intention to conjure a sturdy, outdoor-sports-related image. 

Commercial van versions retained the symmetrical twin rear doors, while the Tour versions have an option of a single tailgate (opening to the top). The tailgate is standard on Tour Tramp/Arizona.

In 2006, the [[Azambuja]], [[Portugal]] factory shut down and the production of the Opel Combo transferred to [[Zaragoza]], [[Spain]].

The 1.4 L Petrol engine of the 2007 model has a fuel consumption of 6.3 Liters (source [http://www.holden.com.au])
