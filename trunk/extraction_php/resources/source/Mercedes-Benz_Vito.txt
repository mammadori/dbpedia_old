The '''Mercedes-Benz Vito''' is a light [[van]] produced by [[Mercedes-Benz]] in [[Vitoria, Spain]]. From the name of the city ''Vitoria'' came the name ''Vito''. The name was also derived from an exemplary, long-standing employee, Vito Rosenstein. Vito's dedication to the company resulted in an unusually high accolade.

It is available as a standard panel van, or with additional passenger accommodation substituted for part or all of the load area.

The first generation [[Mercedes-Benz]] Vito was produced between 1996 and 2003. It is powered either by a diesel engine with up to {{convert|120|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or a gasoline engine with up to {{convert|140|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and a [[front-wheel drive]] drivetrain.

==2nd Generation (2003-present)==

The second generation [[Mercedes-Benz]] Vito is more streamlined than its predecessor, but more importantly is powered by a new range of engines and a [[rear-wheel drive]] (RWD) drivetrain.

The angle of the [[windshield]] and [[pillar (car)|A-pillar]] is closer to [[horizontal]]; the [[dashboard]] is bigger and the hood smaller.  The newer Vito is available in 3 different lengths and 4 diesel engine versions being the 109 CDI, the 111 CDI, the 115 CDI and the powerful 120 CDI. The model numerics conform with the Mercedes pattern that relates to a rough guide to engine power output. In the Vito range currently the 109 has {{convert|93|bhp|abbr=on}}, 111 relates to {{convert|116|bhp|abbr=on}}, 115 to {{convert|150|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and 120 to {{convert|204|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

The 2nd generation Vitos are all [[European emission standards|Euro]] 3 compliant (additionally Euro 4 compliant as of November 2006) and therefore exempt from the upcoming [[London low emission zone|Low Emission Zone]] in London.  This requires commercial vehicles (vans) to reach at least Euro 3 standard from October 2010.

==London Taxi variant==
In August 2008 a variant of the Vito was approved by the [[Public Carriage Office]] for use as a licensed London '[[Hackney carriage|black cab]]'.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/businessandpartners/13-08-mercedes-benz-vito-taxi.pdf PCO Notice - Mercedes-Benz Vito Taxi], [[Public Carriage Office]] notice at [[Transport for London]], 13 August 2008</ref> The Vito taxicab includes electric sliding doors, electric steps and seating for six people. The Vito's rear-wheel steering enables it to meet the PCO's strict {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} turning circle rule and it is able to carry two wheelchairs.<ref>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23500360-details/Hail,+the+new+London+cab/article.do Hail, the new London cab], ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 26 June 2008</ref> The vehicle, a variation of the 'Traveliner' model, is built by Penso in Coventry.  The rear wheel steer system is licenced from one80, and it is distributed through Eco City Vehicles subsidiary KPM-UK Taxis.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/2791681/Mercedes-Benz-to-launch-eco-friendly-London-black-cab.html Mercedes-Benz to launch eco-friendly London black cab], [[Daily Telegraph]] 17 June 2008</ref>

Because the Mercedes Taxi has sliding doors the option of opening windows is no longer available to passengers.  The PCO (Public Carriage Office) has also specified that the option of sliding windows has also been banned, this is due to the danger of passengers having part of their body out of the windows when the doors open.

The new Taxi doesn't perform the famous u-turn in the same way as the TX and Metro models, instead it incorporates an electrically operated rear wheel system, activated by a button adjacent to the steering wheel.  This turns the rear wheels in the opposite direction to the front wheels, thus allowing the Taxi to perform the same tight turning circle as the TX and Metro models.  This system is only possible when the vehicle is traveling less than than {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and if the vehicle goes over {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} while the LSM is active, it is deactivated and the wheels straighten up.

It is longer and wider than the TX models, but traveling through tight spaces is aided by the electric folding wing mirrors, from the options list.
