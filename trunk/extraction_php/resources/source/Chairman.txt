The '''chairman''' is the      highest office of an organized group such as a [[Board of directors|board]], [[committee]], or [[deliberative assembly]]. The person holding the office is typically elected or appointed by the members of the group. The chairman presides over [[meeting]]s of the assembled group and conducts its business in an orderly fashion.<ref name='Robert'>''[[Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'', 10<sup>th</sup> edition, Perseus Books Group, Cambridge MA, 2000</ref> When the group is not in session, the officer's duties often including acting as its head, its representative to the outside world and its spokesperson. 

==Terminology==
The term ''chairman'' has its origins in 10th century [[Kingdom of England]], when the [[king]] or his spokesman sat alone in a [[chair]] before the group, who sat on [[Bench (furniture)|benches]] or stood. ''Manus'' is [[Latin]] for "hand," so the chairman is one who sits in the '''''chair''''' and '''''hand'''les'' the meeting.<ref name='Riddick'>{{cite book | last = Riddick | first = Floyd M. | authorlink = | first2 = Miriam H.| last2=Butcher | title = Riddick's Rules of Procedure : a modern guide to faster and more efficient meetings | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | date = 1985 | location = New York | pages = | url = http://www.amazon.com/Riddicks-Rules-Floyd-M-Riddick/dp/0819180645 | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780684184272}}</ref> The term has nothing to do with gender or the word ''man'', contrarily to populr belief, and is used in addressing the official as “Mister Chairman” or “Madam Chairman.”<ref name="Zimmerman"/>   Other terms sometimes used for the office and its holder include ''[[presiding officer]]'', ''[[president]]'', ''[[moderator]]'', ''chair'', and ''convener''.<ref name=Sturgis2001>{{Citation

A ''vice chairman'' is sometimes chosen to be subordinate to and to serve in the absence of the chairman. In the absence of the chairman and vice chairman, groups sometimes elect a ''chairman pro tem'' to fill the role for a single meeting..<ref name="Robert"/>

The word ''chair'' can refer to the place from which the holder of the office presides, whether on a chair, at a lectern, or elsewhere. During meetings, the person presiding is said to be “in the chair”, the person is also referred to as “the chair.”  [[Parliamentary procedure]] requires that members address the “chair” rather than the “chairman,” or by using a person's name. This is one of many customs indended to maintain the presiding officer's impartiality and insuring an objective and impersonal approach.<ref name="Robert"/>

==Corporate governance==
A chairman is selected by a company's board to lead the [[board of directors]], preside over meetings, and lead the board to [[consensus]] from the disparate points of view of its members. The chairman is the presiding director over the other directors on the board and is expected to be fair, a good listener, and a good communicator. Directors have a high level of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary responsibility]] for overseeing the operation of a [[corporation]]. 

The term ''president'' is often used interchangeably with chairman, especially in the United States. The CEO is the head of the management committee and usually reports to the board, which is headed by the chairman.

In [[Public company|public companies]], the role of the chairman of the board is distinct from that of the company's CEO or [[managing director]]. This point has more recently been brought into focus after [[corporate governance]] shortcomings were observed in companies where the two roles are combined. It is believed that the [[Separation of powers|separation of functions]] within the board of directors or in the structure of the supervisory board and management board would facilitate control over the workings of the company and increase the accountability of the CEO or chairman of the management board. In an attempt to inject [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] into the relationship between executive management and the board of directors as well as between management and the market or shareholders, the UK [[Cadbury Report]] was published in 1992. Its recommendations have been adopted to a greater or lesser extent by some countries within the [[European Union]] and the United States, as well as by the [[World Bank]].

===Chairman of the Board types===
In the case of companies and similarly-organized bodies, there are generally two types of chairmen, non-executive and executive.

====Non-executive====
A non-executive Chairman of the Board is and does the following:
*A part-time officeholder who sits on and chairs the main board of a company.
*Provides support and advice to a CEO. 
*This position usually entails fulfilling a similar function on a number of additional board committees, as well as being a political figurehead of the Company. 

====Executive====
An executive Chairman of the Board is and does the following:
*A full-time officeholder who typically leads the board and also takes a hands-on role in the company's day-to-day management.
*Helps the CEO to oversee all the operational aspects involved in running the company, which include project planning and development delivery, retail and leasing, sales, market research and many other areas within their extensive scope.
*Has overall responsibility for the company which involves engineering and controlling the company's current growth in and future expansion into international markets.
*In addition, oversees all projects' development activities and related businesses of the company, generating significant financial returns for the shareholders and driving sustainable development.
The chairman often sets the style of leadership of the board which in turn filters down through the organization.

==Academic position==
Chairs at academic institutions refer to the position, rather than the individual, and are often named after the person who donated the money to support the position. [[Professor]]s appointed to such a chair often receive guaranteed funding (often [[Financial endowment|endowed]]). Colleges and universities, especially older and well-financed ones, may have many such chairs.

Some of the best known chairs have been held by a succession of well-known scholars; the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Chair of Mathematics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] has been held by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[Paul Dirac]], and [[Stephen Hawking]], while the [[Quain Professor|Quain]] Chair of [[Jurisprudence]] at [[University College London]] has been held by [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], [[H. L. A. Hart]], and [[Ronald Dworkin]].

The word ''chair'' is also used in [[Higher education in the United States|American universities]] to refer to the head of an [[academic department]], particularly if the policies of a university are such that the chair is elected directly, or appointed with the recommendation of, the department's [[Faculty (university)|faculty]].  To illustrate, Professor Example is the Chair of the English Department and Professor of English of Example University.  Chairs are simultaneously [[Academic administration|administrators]] and faculty members; chairs at one major American university system were estimated to spend 61 to 80 percent of their time on administrative duties, as opposed to their research and teaching.<ref>''The [[California State University]] Department Chair Survey Reported"([http://www.calstate.edu/AcadSen/Records/Reports/CSU_Chairs_survey_report.pdf online version]), vi.</ref>
