The '''Audi RSQ''' is a [[mid-engined]] [[concept car]] developed by [[Audi|Audi AG]] for use as a [[product placement]] in the 2004 [[sci-fi]] [[Film|movie]] ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]''. It is meant to depict a technologically advanced automobile in the [[Chicago]] cityscape from the year 2035.

This [[sports car|sports]] [[coupé]] is a visionary interpretation of Audi's typical [[automobile design]]. An important challenge presented to the designers was that despite its extreme character, the car still had to be recognised by the audience as an Audi. To accommodate this demand, the engineers implemented a current Audi front-end design which includes the trapezoidal "Audi Single-Frame [[Grille]]", the company's trademark overlapping four rings, and the [[Multi Media Interface]] (MMI) driver-to-car control system.<ref name="PR">{{cite web |url= http://www.audiworld.com/news/04/nyias/robot2/ |title= The Making of the Audi RSQ for the Epic Movie Event "I, ROBOT" |accessdate=2007-12-30 |date= 2004-04-07 |work= Press release |publisher= Audi}}</ref>

The RSQ also includes special features suggested by [[movie director]] [[Alex Proyas]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.domain-b.com/brand_dossier/adv_brnd/20071228_automobiles.html |title= Automobiles and their placement in movies: Good for the image? news |accessdate=2007-12-30 |date= 2007-12-28 |work= Brand Dossier |publisher= domain-b.com }}</ref> Many think it utilizes [[sphere]]s instead of [[wheel]]s (this is how the car appears in the film), but this is not the case, as underneath it is taken from an Audi A4. Its two reverse [[butterfly doors]] are hinged to the B-posts of the body.<ref name="PR"/>

Although this kind of collaboration was a first for Audi, a similar project was developed by [[Lexus]] for use in the 2002 film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]''.
