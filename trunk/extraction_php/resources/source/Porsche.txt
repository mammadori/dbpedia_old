'''Porsche Automobil Holding SE''', usually shortened to '''Porsche SE''' ({{IPA-en|ˈpɔrʃə|}}<ref>{{cite web|title=How do you say "Porsche"?|publisher=About.com|url=http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa020401b.htm|accessdate=2009-06-26}}</ref>), a '''''S'''ocietas '''E'''uropaea'' or [[European Company Statute|European Public Company]], is a [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry|automotive manufacturer]] of [[luxury vehicle|luxury]] [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] [[automobile]]s, which is majority-owned by the [[Louise Piëch|Piëch]] and [[Porsche family|Porsche families]].  Porsche SE is [[headquarters|headquartered]] in Zuffenhausen, a city district of [[Stuttgart]], [[Baden-Württemberg]].

Porsche SE is the 'top-tier' [[parent company|parent-]] and [[holding company]], which includes two main [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] - '''Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG''' (which stands for ''Doktor Ingenieur [[honoris causa]] Ferdinand Porsche [[Aktiengesellschaft]]''), often shortened to '''Porsche AG''', and '''[[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen AG]]''' (known in English as Volkswagen Group).  Porsche AG is the subsidiary of Porsche SE which is responsible for the actual production and manufacture of the Porsche automobile line, and Volkswagen AG is the 'top-tier' parent of the Volkswagen Group automotive [[marque]]s; which include (but not limited to) [[Audi]], [[Bentley Motors]] and [[Bugatti Automobiles]].

==Overview==
It was founded in 1931 by [[Ferdinand Porsche]], an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[engineer]] born in Maffersdorf, Austria-Hungary (today [[Vratislavice nad Nisou]], [[Czech Republic]]).  Porsche is also known for designing the first [[Volkswagen]], but [[Béla Barényi]] is credited with having conceived the basic design five years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/honors/index.php?cmd=view&id=4&type=inductees|title=Béla Barényi (1907 - 1997)|work=[[Automotive Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>  The company currently produces [[Porsche 911|911]] ([[Porsche 997|997]]), [[Porsche Boxster|Boxster]] and [[Porsche Cayman|Cayman]] sports cars and [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]] [[sport utility vehicle]]s.  The latest model line, the four-door [[Porsche Panamera|Panamera]] [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] (sedan), was launched on Monday, 20 April 2009.

In August 2009, Porsche SE and [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen AG)]] reached an agreement that Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG would merge in 2011, to form an "Integrated Automotive Group".<ref name=PorscheMerger/><ref name=VWAG_merger/>

In a May 2006 survey, Porsche was awarded the title of the most prestigious [[automobile]] brand by [[The Luxury Institute|Luxury Institute]], New York; it questioned more than 500 households with a gross annual income of at least US $200,000 and a net worth of at least US $720,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porsche enjoys unsurpassed prestige in US|publisher=Porsche AG press release|url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/aboutporsche/pressreleases/pag/?pool=international-de&id=2006-05-05|accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>  The current Porsche [[car model|model range]] includes sports cars from the [[Porsche Boxster|Boxster]] [[roadster]] to their most famous product, the [[Porsche 911|911]].  The [[Porsche Cayman|Cayman]] is a hard top car similar to the Boxster in a slightly higher price range.  The [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]] is Porsche's mid-size luxury [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV).  The limited run [[Porsche Carrera GT|Carrera GT]] ceased production in May 2006.  A high performance luxury [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]], the [[Panamera]], was launched on Monday, 20 April 2009, but is due to be released worldwide in September and October. Recently, a spider version of the Boxster was announced, and will be available after it is unveiled at the 2009 Los Angeles Auto Show.

Porsche was awarded the 2006 [[J.D. Power and Associates]] award for the highest-ranked nameplate in its Initial Quality Study (IQS) of automobile brands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magna Steyr Assembly Plant in Graz, Austria, Receives Top Vehicle Quality Award in Europe|url=http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/pdf/2006082b.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|work=[[J.

As a company, Porsche is known for weathering changing market conditions with great financial stability, while retaining most production in Germany during an age when most other German car manufacturers have moved at least parts of their production to Eastern Europe or overseas.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The [[headquarters]] and main factory are still in Zuffenhausen, a district in [[Stuttgart]], but the Cayenne (and formerly the Carrera GT) is manufactured in [[Leipzig]], Germany, parts<ref name=Reuters>{{cite news|title=Union says VW's Slovak plant eyes output cut|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSL911061920081009|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=2008-10-09|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> for the SUV are assembled also in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].

Porsche has for many years offered consultancy services to various other car manufacturers.  [[Audi]], [[Studebaker]], [[SEAT]], [[Daewoo]], [[Subaru]], and [[Zastava Koral|Yugo]] have consulted Porsche on engineering for their cars or engines.  The [[Lada Samara]]<ref>[http://www.porscheengineering.com/peg/en/about/history/about-milestones/81/ Porsche Engineering info]</ref> was partly developed by Porsche in 1984.  Porsche also helped [[Harley-Davidson]] design their new Revolution water cooled engine that is used in their V-Rod motorcycle, as Porsche had previous experience switching from air-cooling to water cooling.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===SUV reception===
According to [[CNBC]], even an at-the-time questionable foray into the SUV market with the Cayenne in 2003, couldn't damage Porsche credibility.<ref name=CNBC>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/29779227|title=Peering Into Porsche's Future|last=DeBord|first=Matthew|date=2009-03-19|work=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref>  [[The Times]] journalist Andrew Frankel says on one level, it is the world's best 4x4, on another, it is the cynical exploitation of a glorious brand that risks long-term damage to that brand’s very identity in the pursuit of easy money<ref name=Frankel>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/new_car_reviews/article823701.ece|title=Porsche Cayenne|last=Frankel |first=Andrew |date=2002-11-17|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> with his verdict being "Great car, if only it wasn't a Porsche".<ref name=Frankel/>  Despite the controversy faced by critics, the Cayenne has been a success, generating enough profit for the company to invest in and upgrade the existing model range, as well as fund the Panamera project.  As of August 2009, well over 250,000 Cayennes have been built.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==History==
[[Image:Wappen Volksstaat Württemberg (Farbe).svg|thumb|right|[[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] [[Württemberg]] coat of arms]]
[[Image:Coat of arms of Stuttgart.svg|thumb|right|[[Stuttgart#Name and coat of arms|Coat of arms of Stuttgart]]]]
Professor [[Ferdinand Porsche]] founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" in 1930,<ref name=Auto/> with main offices at Kronenstraße 24 in the center of [[Stuttgart]].  Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and [[consultant|consulting]],<ref name=Auto/> but did not build any cars under its own name.  One of the first assignments the new company received was from the [[Germany|German]] government to design a car for the people, a {{lang-de|Volkswagen}}.<ref name=Auto/>  This resulted in the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], one of the most successful car designs of all time.  The first Porsche, the [[Porsche 64]], was developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.<ref name=Auto>{{cite web|author=J. P. Vettraino|title=Porsche at 60: The little sports-car company that could|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20081222/FREE/812229989|work=[[Autoweek]]|date=2008-12-23|accessdate=2009-01-30}}</ref>

During [[World War II]],<ref name=Beetle>{{cite book|last=Burt|first=William|title=Volkswagen Beetle|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company|year=2002|page=14|isbn=9780760310786}}</ref> [[Volkswagen]] production turned to the military version of the Volkswagen Beetle, the [[Kübelwagen]],<ref name=Beetle/> 52,000 produced, and [[Schwimmwagen]],<ref name=Beetle/> 14,000 produced.  Porsche produced several designs for [[heavy tank]]s during the war, losing out to [[Henschel & Son]] in both contracts that ultimately led to the [[Tiger I]] and the [[Tiger II]].  However, not all this work was wasted, as the chassis Porsche designed for the Tiger I was used as the base for the [[Elefant]] [[tank destroyer]].  Porsche also developed the [[Panzer VIII Maus|Maus]] [[super-heavy tank]] in the closing stages of the war, producing two prototypes.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

At the end of WW2 in 1945, the [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|Volkswagen factory]] at [[Wolfsburg]] fell to the [[United Kingdom|British]].  Ferdinand lost his position as Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen, and a [[British Army]] [[Major]] - [[Ivan Hirst]] was put in charge of the factory.  (In Wolfsburg, the Volkswagen company magazine dubbed him "The British Major who saved Volkswagen."<ref>{{cite book|last=Mantle|first=Jonathan|title=Car wars: fifty years of greed, treachery, and skulduggery in the global marketplace|publisher=[[Arcade Publishing]]|year=1996|page=216|isbn=9781559703338}}</ref>)  On 15 December of that year, Ferdinand was arrested for war crimes, but not tried.  During his 20-month imprisonment, Ferdinand Porsche's son, [[Ferry Porsche]], decided to build his own car because he could not find an existing one that he wanted to buy.  He also had to steer the company through some of its most difficult days until his father's release in August 1947.<ref name="Gmünd">{{cite book|last=Meredith|first=Laurence|coauthors=Mark Hughes|title=Original Porsche 356|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company|year=1995|page=7|isbn=9781870979580}}</ref>  The first models of what was to become the [[Porsche 356|356]] were built in a small sawmill in [[Gmünd]], [[Austria]].<ref name="Gmünd"/>  The [[prototype]] car was shown to German auto dealers, and when pre-orders reached a set threshold, production was begun.  Many regard the 356 as the first Porsche simply because it was the first model ''sold'' by the fledgling company.  Porsche commissioned a Zuffenhausen-based company, ''Reutter Karosserie'', which had previously collaborated with the firm on Volkswagen Beetle prototypes, to produce the 356's steel [[bodywork|body]].  In 1952, Porsche constructed an [[manufacturing|assembly]] plant (Werk 2) across the street from ''Reutter Karosserie''; the main road in front of Werk 1, the oldest Porsche building, is now known as Porschestrasse.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Lamm|title=Porsche Boxster|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I3vlWXLcwgUC&pg=PA100|page=100|year=1998|isbn=9780760305195}}</ref>  The 356 was road certified in 1948.

Porsche's company logo was based on the [[:Image:Wappen Volksstaat Württemberg (Farbe).svg|coat of arms]] of [[Free People's State of Württemberg]] of former [[Weimar Germany]], which had Stuttgart as its capital and became part of [[Baden-Württemberg]] after the political consolidation of [[West Germany]] in 1949.

Not long afterwards, on 30 January 1951, Ferdinand Porsche died from complications following a stroke.

In post-war Germany, parts were generally in short supply, so the 356 automobile used components from the Volkswagen Beetle including its [[internal combustion engine|engine]], [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]].  The 356, however, had several evolutionary stages, A, B, and C, while in production, and many Volkswagen parts were replaced by Porsche-made parts.  The last 356s were powered by entirely Porsche-designed engines.  The sleek [[bodywork]] was designed by [[Erwin Komenda]] who also had designed the body of the Beetle.  Porsche's signature designs have, from the beginning, featured air-cooled rear-engine configurations (like the Beetle), rare for other car manufacturers, but producing automobiles that are very well balanced.

In 1964, after some success in [[motor-racing]], namely with the [[Porsche 550|Porsche 550 Spyder]], the company launched the [[Porsche 911]] another air-cooled, rear-engined sports car, this time with a six-cylinder [[flat engine|"boxer" engine]].  The team to lay out the body shell design was led by Ferry Porsche's eldest son, [[Ferdinand Alexander Porsche]] (F. A.).  The design phase for the 911 caused internal problems with Erwin Komenda, who led the body design department until then.  F. A. Porsche complained Komenda made unauthorized changes to the design.  Company leader Ferry Porsche took his son's drawings to neighboring chassis manufacturer Reuter.  Reuter's workshop was later acquired by Porsche (so-called Werk 2).  Afterward Reuter became a seat manufacturer, today known as [[Recaro|Keiper-Recaro]].

The design group gave sequential numbers to every project (356, 550, etc.), but the designated 901 nomenclature contravened [[Peugeot]]'s trademarks on all 'x0x' names, so it was adjusted to 911.  Racing models adhered to the "correct" numbering sequence: 904, 906, 908.  The 911 has become Porsche's most well-known and [[icon]]ic model - successful on the race-track, in [[rallying|rallies]], and in terms of sales.  Far more than any other model, the Porsche brand is defined by the 911.  It remains in production; however, after several generations of revision, current-model 911s share only the basic mechanical concept of a rear-engined, six-cylinder coupe, and basic styling cues with the original car.  A cost-reduced model with the same body, but 356-derived running gear (including its four-cylinder engine), was sold as the 912.

[[Image:Porsche 912.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Porsche 912]], from the 1960s]]
In 1972, the company's legal form was changed from limited partnership to public limited company (AG in German), because Ferry Porsche and his sister, [[Louise Piëch]], felt their generation members did not team up well.  This led to the foundation of an executive board whose members came from outside the Porsche family, and a supervisory board consisting mostly of family members.  With this change, no family members were in operational charge of the company.  F. A. Porsche founded his own design company, [[Porsche Design Group|Porsche Design]], which is renowned for exclusive sunglasses, watches, furniture, and many other luxury articles.  [[Ferdinand Piëch]], who was responsible for mechanical development of Porsche's serial and racing cars, formed his own engineering bureau, and developed a [[straight-five engine|five-cylinder-inline]] [[diesel engine]] for [[Mercedes-Benz]].  A short time later he moved to [[Audi]], and pursued his career through the entire company, up to and including, the [[Volkswagen Group]] boards.

The first [[chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) of Porsche AG was Dr. Ernst Fuhrmann, who had been working in the company's engine development.  Fuhrmann was responsible for the so-called Fuhrmann-engine used in the 356 Carrera models, as well as the 550 Spyder, having [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|four overhead camshafts]] instead of a central [[overhead camshaft]], as in the Volkswagen-derived serial engines.  He planned to cease the 911 during the [[1970s]], and replace it with the [[V8 engine|V8]]-[[front-engine design|front engined]] grand sportswagon [[Porsche 928|928]].  As we know today, the 911 outlived the 928 by far.  Fuhrmann was replaced in the early [[1980s]] by [[Peter W. Schutz]], an American manager and self-proclaimed 911 aficionado.  He was then replaced in 1988 by the former manager of German computer company Nixdorf Computer AG, Arno Bohn, who made some costly miscalculations that led to his dismissal soon after, along with that of the development director, [[Dr. Ulrich Bez]], who was formerly responsible for BMW's [[BMW Z1|Z1]] model, and today is CEO of [[Aston Martin]].

In 1990, Porsche drew up a memorandum of understanding with [[Toyota]] to learn and benefit from Japanese production methods.  Currently Toyota is assisting{{citation needed|date=August 2008}} Porsche with [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid technology]], rumored to be making its way into a Hybrid Cayenne SUV and, announced for the 2011 model four-door coupe, the [[Porsche Panamera]]. 

Following the dismissal of Bohn, an interim CEO was appointed, longtime Porsche employee, Heinz Branitzki, who served in that position until [[Dr. Wendelin Wiedeking]] became CEO in 1993.  Wiedeking took over the chairmanship of the board at a time when Porsche appeared vulnerable to a takeover by a larger company.  During his long tenure, Wiedeking has transformed Porsche into a very efficient and profitable company.

Ferdinand Porsche's grandson, [[Ferdinand Piëch]], was chairman and CEO of the [[Volkswagen Group]] from 1993 to 2002.  Today he is chairman of the supervisory board.  With 12.8 per cent of the Porsche voting shares, he also remains the second largest individual shareholder of Porsche AG after his cousin, F. A. Porsche, (13.6 per cent).

Porsche's 2002 introduction of the Cayenne also marked the unveiling of a new production facility in [[Leipzig]], [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]], which once accounted for nearly half of Porsche's annual output.  The Cayenne Turbo S has the second most powerful production engine in Porsche's history, with the most powerful belonging to the Carrera GT.

In 2004, production of the {{convert|456|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} Carrera GT commenced in Leipzig, and at EUR 450,000 ($440,000 in the United States) it was the most expensive production model Porsche ever built.

As of 2005, the extended Porsche and Piëch families controlled all of Porsche AG's voting shares.  In early October 2005 the company announced acquisition of an 18.53% stake in [[Volkswagen Group]] (VWAG), and disclosed intentions to acquire additional VWAG shares in the future.  As of June 2006, the Porsche AG stake in VWAG had risen to 25.1%, giving Porsche a blocking minority, whereby Porsche can veto large corporate decisions undertaken by VWAG.

In mid-2006, after years of the Boxster (and later the Cayenne) as the dominant Porsche in North America, the 911 regained its position as Porsche's backbone in the region.  The Cayenne and 911 have cycled as the top-selling model since.  In Germany the 911 clearly outsells the Boxster/Cayman and Cayenne.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/aboutporsche/pressreleases/pag/archive2006/quarter3/|title=Porsche USA press release|date=2006-09-11}}</ref>

===Relationship with Volkswagen===
The company has always had a close relationship with initially the [[Volkswagen]] (VW) [[marque]], and later, the [[Volkswagen Group]] (VWAG) (which also owns [[Audi|Audi AG]]), because the first [[Volkswagen Beetle]] was designed by [[Ferdinand Porsche]].  (Initial production of the first Beetle was made with cooperation and by Daimler-Benz AG)  The two companies collaborated in 1969 to make the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914 and 914-6]], whereby the 914-6 had a Porsche engine, and the 914 had a Volkswagen engine, in 1976 with the [[Porsche 912|Porsche 912E]] (USA only) and the [[Porsche 924]], which used many Audi components, and was built at Audi's [[Neckarsulm]] factory.  Most [[Porsche 944]]s also were built there although they used far fewer Volkswagen components.  The Cayenne, introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with [[Volkswagen Touareg]] and [[Audi Q7]], which is built at the [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|VWAG factory]] in [[Bratislava]].  In late 2005, Porsche took an 18.65% stake in the Volkswagen Group, further cementing their relationship, and preventing a takeover of Volkswagen Group, which was rumored at the time.  Speculated suitors included [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler AG]], [[BMW]], and [[Renault]].

On 26 March 2007, Porsche took its holding of Volkswagen Group shares to 30.9%, triggering a takeover bid under [[Law of Germany|German Law]].  Porsche then formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen Group (it would set its offer price at the lowest possible legal value), but intended the move to avoid a competitor taking a large stake, or to stop [[hedge fund]]s dismantling VWAG, which is Porsche's most important partner.<ref>{{cite news|title=Porsche triggers VW takeover bid|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6494593.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-03-26|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref>  Porsche's move comes after the [[European Union]] moved against a German Law that protected VWAG from takeovers.  Under the so-called "Volkswagen Law", any shareholder with more than 20% of the voting rights has veto power over any corporate decision in the annual general meeting - in effect, any shareholder in VWAG cannot exercise more than 20% of the firm's voting rights, regardless of their level of stock holding.  (The local state government of [[Lower Saxony]] owns 20.1% of the shares.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7843262.stm |title=Fast bucks: how Porsche made billions |accessdate=2009-01-22 |publisher=BBC News|date=2009-01-22}}</ref>)  However, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled against the law, potentially paving the way for a takeover.<ref>{{cite web|title=VW Law is a write-off|url=http://www.ManagementToday.co.uk/channel/StrategyOperations/news/754256/vw-law-write-off|work=[[Management Today]]|date=2007-10-23|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>

On 16 September 2008, Porsche increased its shares by another 4.89%,<ref>{{cite press release|title = Porsche erhöht seine VW-Beteiligung auf 35,14 Prozent|language={{de icon}}|url=http://www.porsche.com/germany/aboutporsche/pressreleases/?pool=germany&id=2d745b91-8c92-4354-9805-f9aa45bb7c68|publisher=Porsche AG|date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> in effect taking control of the company, with more than 35% of the voting rights.  It again triggered a takeover bid, but this time over Audi.  Porsche dismissed the bid as a mere formality, since it is Porsche's intention to keep the corporate structure of the Volkswagen Group.

There has been some tension and anxiety amongst the Volkswagen Group workers, who fear that a Porsche takeover might signify a hardened production efficiency control, rejection of demands for payment rises or even personnel cuts.<ref name=IHT>{{cite web|author=Nelson D. Schwartz|title=Porsche maneuvers to take control of Volkswagen|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/16/business/vw.php|work=[[International Herald Tribune]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref>  [[Ferdinand Piëch]] and his cousin, [[Wolfgang Porsche]], also seemed to be on a collision course.<ref name=IHT/>

On 13 August, Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft’s Supervisory Board signed the agreement to create an integrated automotive group with Porsche led by Volkswagen AG.  Volkswagen will initially take a 49.9 percent stake in Porsche AG by the end of 2009, and it will also see the family shareholders selling the automobile trading business of Porsche Holding Salzburg to Volkswagen.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.taume.com/World-Business/Business-Finance/Volkswagen-to-take-a-42-0-percent-stake-in-Porsche-AG-11861|title=Volkswagen to take a 42.0 percent stake in Porsche AG  |accessdate=2009-01-22 |publisher=Taume News|date=2009-08-14}}</ref>

===Corporate restructuring===
Through the [[Volkswagen Group]] stake acquisition, Porsche intends to reform the company's format, with Dr Ing. h. c. F. Porsche AG becoming a [[subsidiary]] of a newly formed holding company called "Porsche Automobil Holding SE".  Thus the operating activities are separated from holding activities of the company.<ref name=SE>{{cite web|title=Porsche Automobile Holding SE|url=http://www.porsche.com/international/aboutporsche/porschese/|work=Porsche official website}}</ref>  There was an [[Extraordinary General Meeting]] (EGM) for Porsche AG shareholders which took place on 26 June 2007, at the Porsche Arena in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] to discuss the change to the company structure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porsche SE|url=http://www.porsche-se.com/pho/en/porschese/|work=Porsche SE official website}}</ref>

On 3 March 2008, Porsche set the stage for obtaining a majority stake in the Volkswagen Group.  One day later Porsche sought to allay fears it would attempt to force a [[merger]] with Volkswagen Group.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/03/04/porsche.vw.ap/index.html Porsche rules out Volkswagen merger]</ref>  By September, Porsche owned a 35.14% majority stake in Volkswagen Group, effectively giving it control over the company.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2008/09/16/porsche-raises-stake-in-vw-again-makes-offer-for-audi/ Porsche raises stake in VW again, makes offer for Audi]</ref>  Volkswagen Group expected the move, and continues to welcome Porsche's investment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porsche Gains Nearly 75% of VW, Tightening Grip|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122506315406770367.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|date=2008-10-27|accessdate=2008-11-26}}</ref>

On 26 October 2008, Porsche announced its intent to raise its stake in Volkswagen Group to 75% during 2009.

On 7 January 2009, Porsche's holding in VWAG was raised to 50.76%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/4car/news/news-story.jsp?news_id=18546 |title=Porsche holds over half of Volkswagen - Latest Car News from 4Car |publisher=Channel4.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref>  Porsche's move automatically triggered a bid for [[Scania (company)|Scania AB]], because VWAG already had a controlling position in the Swedish [[truck]]-maker.<ref>{{cite news|author=Miles Johnson|title=Porsche's VW move boosts carmakers|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/12f9f23a-dc5b-11dd-b07e-000077b07658.html|work=[[Financial Times]]date=2009-01-07|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>  As Porsche had no strategic interest in the company, on 19 January, they offered the minimum price in that mandatory takeover bid.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porsche Offers Minimum Price in Required Scania Bid |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&sid=aAf8xFogBtnY&refer=germany|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=2009-01-19|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>  Porsche SE owned 50.8 percent of Volkswagen Group as of 5 January 2009, and has said it plans to lift the stake to 75 percent before the end of 2009, at that level they could bring VWAG's cash onto Porsche's books.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&sid=aSxAgX78NB_s&refer=germany|title=VW Gains as Porsche Refinancing Boosts Expectations|last=Cremer|first=Andreas|date=2009-03-26|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref> 

In March 2009, Porsche SE is aiming for its first ever credit ratings from U.S. rating agencies [[Standard & Poor's]] and [[Moody's]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090326-705242.html|title=Porsche Seeking Credit Ratings From S&P, Moody's - Source|last=Arends|first=Hilde|date=2009-03-26|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|agency=[[Dow Jones Newswires]]|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>

In its efforts to acquire a majority holding in Volkswagen Group, Porsche built up a large debt burden, aggravated by taxes due on very large paper profits from Volkswagen Group options.  By July 2009, Porsche was faced with debts exceeding 10 billion euros.  The supervisory board of Porsche finally agreed to a number of arrangements whereby the Qatar Investment Authority would inject a large amount of capital, and Porsche would be [[merger|merged]] with Volkswagen Group.  On 23 July 2009, [[Michael Macht]] was appointed CEO, to replace [[Wendelin Wiedeking]], who is expected to receive a compensation package of 50 million euros.<ref>{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Schäfer|title=€50m payoff for ousted Porsche chief|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ba9dce78-774f-11de-8c68-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=aa6fe7da-776c-11de-8c68-00144feabdc0.html|work=FT.com|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Schäfer|title=Porsche chief ousted in merger with VW|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/af6e14c6-77eb-11de-9713-00144feabdc0.html|work=FT.com|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|date=2009-07-24|accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Schäfer|title=Just another week at the office for Piëch|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f94c8e7e-787c-11de-bb06-00144feabdc0.html|work=FT.com|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|date=2009-07-24|accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Schäfer|title='Wiedeking Is to Blame for the Porsche Disaster'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,638084,00.html|work=Spiegel Online|publisher=Spiegel Online GmbH|date=2009-07-24|accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref>

According to CNBC, "Volkswagen has Sealed the Deal for Porsche" as of 14 August 2009.

On 31 August, reports began circulating that under Volkswagen Group's umbrella, the [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]] and [[Porsche Panamera|Panamera]] will be axed from Porsche's line-up once they complete their model cycles in seven years, so as to reduce competition with Volkswagen's current SUV and saloon offerings.  Volkswagen Group believes that it is oversaturated with SUVs and saloons, and will thus restructure Porsche to be a strictly sports car-producing marque.  This would mean that the [[Porsche Boxster|Boxster]], [[Porsche Cayman|Cayman]] and [[Porsche 911|911]] would survive, along with rumored introductions of a successor to the [[Porsche Carrera GT|Carrera GT]] supercar, and an entry-level roadster to be positioned below the current Boxster.  The reports, however, are yet to be confirmed from either Porsche or Volkswagen AG.[http://www.autoobserver.com/2009/08/porsches-off-message-models-axed-in-vw-takeover.html]

On 2 September, an article was published revealing that Porsche executives dismissed the rumours surrounding the Cayenne and Panamera demises as absurd, for numerous reasons:
*Volkswagen Group CEO Martin Winterkorn's recent pledge to have Porsche producing 150,000 vehicles annually within the next few years would be near-impossible without the Cayenne, as it is the company's best-selling vehicle, and allowed it to penetrate foreign markets such as Russia and China.
*A one billion Euro investment programme was dedicated to the development of the Panamera, a feat which involved the expansion of Porsche's Leipzig production facility (where the Cayenne is currently built) to accommodate production of the Panamera.

Therefore, it would seem illogical to terminate two of Porsche's most ambitious projects.  Confirmation on whether or not the vehicles will be terminated is yet to be received from Volkswagen Group or Porsche officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/porsche-to-kill-cayenne-and-panamera-at-the-behest-of-vw-probably-not/ | title=Porsche to Kill Cayenne and Panamera at the Behest of VW?

Porsche has been successful in many branches of [[auto racing|motorsport]], scoring a total of more than 28,000 victories.  Porsche is currently the world's largest race car manufacturer.  In 2006, Porsche built 195 race cars for various international motor sports events.  In 2007, Porsche is expected to construct no fewer than 275 dedicated race cars (7 RS Spyder LMP2 prototypes, 37 GT2 spec 911 GT3-RSRs, and 231 911 GT3 Cup vehicles).<ref>{{cite web|author=Gary Watkins|title=Warehouse Shopping — Inside Porsche's Motorsport Center|url=http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070307/FREE/70305013/1001|work=[[AutoWeek]]|date=2007-03-07|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>

==Pronunciation of "Porsche"==
In [[English language|English]] use, Porsche is often pronounced as a single syllable ({{IPA-en|ˈpɔrʃ|}}), without a final /[[schwa|ə]]/.  However, the company's pronunciation is {{IPA-en|ˈpɔrʃə|}} {{respell|POR|shə}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa020401b.htm |title=Porsche and Neanderthal: Pronouncing German Words in English |publisher=German.about.com |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref> as German language words do not have [[Silent e|silent 'e']].
