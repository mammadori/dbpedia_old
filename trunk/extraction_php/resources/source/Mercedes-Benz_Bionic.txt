The '''Mercedes-Benz Bionic''' was a [[concept car]] created by [[DaimlerChrysler AG]] under the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] Group. It was first introduced in 2005 at the DaimlerChrysler Innovation Symposium in [[Washington]]. The bionic was modelled after a type of [[fish]], the ''[[Ostracion cubicus]]'' (a [[boxfish]]), and also has 80% lower [[nitrogen]] [[nitrogen oxide|oxide]] emissions with its SCR technology.

==Engine and Performance==
The Bionic is powered by a ''103&nbsp;kW direct-injection [[diesel engine]]'' that gives out around 70 [[Miles per gallon|MPG (US)]] (~3.36 L/100&nbsp;km). This engine also gives out around a total of {{convert|140|hp}} and a little over {{convert|221|ftÂ·lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at around 1600 [[rpm]]. The Bionic can go from 0-60 in about 8 seconds and has a top speed of a little over {{convert|190|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} .

==Design==
The exterior design was modelled after the yellow boxfish (''[[Ostracion cubicus]]''), a tropical fish that lives in coral reefs. Mercedes-Benz decided to model the Bionic after this fish due to the low [[coefficient of drag]] of its body shape and the rigidity of its [[exoskeleton]]; this influenced the car's unusual looks. Other parts of the design include the fact that the rear wheels are partially fitted with plastic and that it's considered as a lightweight vehicle. Mercedes-Benz reported a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.19;<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/03/08/cars.fish.popsci/index.html Mercedes' fish-inspired car] (retrieved 2008-08-12)</ref> for comparison, the production vehicle with the lowest ever C<sub>d</sub> value was the [[GM EV1]], at 0.195. While the Bionic had a much larger internal volume than the EV1, the Bionic's larger frontal area made the EV1 more aerodynamic overall.
