'''Büssing''' was a [[Germany|German]] bus and truck manufacturer established by Heinrich Büssing (1843-1929) at Braunschweig in 1903. Büssing's  first truck was a 2 ton payload machine powered by a 2-cylinder gasoline engine and featuring [[worm drive]]. That successful design was later built under licence by other companies in Germany, Austria, Hungary and by [[Straker-Squire]] in England.
Before World War I Büssing started to build heavy-duty trucks for its time.
These trucks featured with 4 and 6 cylinder engines. (5 tonnes and 11 tonnes respectively).
In 1923 Büssing introduced the first rigid three axle chasis which used in upcoming models and allowed Büssing to lead the market share in Germany in commercial vehicles.

== History ==
Büssing NAG used inmates of several [[Nazi]] concentration camps in Brunswiek from 1944 to March 1945 for slave labor. These camps were subcamps to the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]]. <ref>The main camp Büssing and Schilldenkmal is listed as No. 165 Braunschweig in the [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/begdv_6/anlage_6.html official German list] {{de icon}}</ref>

== Acquisitions ==
* First acquisition for Büssing was Mannesmann-Mulag Motoren und Lastwagen AG of Aachen.
* Elbing plant of Automobil Fabrik Kornnick AG.
* In 1934 [[Neue Automobil Gesellschaft]] ('''NAG'''). After the takeover Büssing used the brand '''Büssing-NAG''' until 1950.
* Büssing took over the Borgward plant at Osterholz-Scharmbeck in 1962. This plant used for building military 4 tonne 4x4. (1968 Factory was sold to Faun-Werke GmbH)

== Innovations ==
* 1930's Büssing began building heavy duty trucks with [[diesel engine]]s
* 1936 Büssing pioneered the horizontal "underfloor" diesel engines 
* During World War II Büssing once again supplied military vehicles including 6x4 armoured cars and an 8x8 with '''all-wheel steering'''.

After [[World War II]] civilian production resumed with a 5-tonne and later a 7-tonne trucks.
In 1950 the company name became '''Büssing Nutzkraftwagen GmbH''' and production was concentrated on underfloor-engined trucks which were to become the firm's speciality. Most tractor units and all normal-control trucks had vertical engines, but in the mid 1960s there was a version of their Commodore maximum-weight tractor unit, the 16-210. which had a horizontal diesel mounted under the cab ahead of the front axle, the gearbox being mounted halfway along the truck's chassis.
In 1969 Büssing started strong ties with [[MAN SE|MAN AG]]. MAN AG was a customer to some Büssing's innovative trucks and parts while they were promoting their own line-up.
In 1971 [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] takeover of Büssing was announced. 
MAN AG started to use the lion logo on their newly named trucks MAN-Büssings.

Büssing's unique underfloor-engined truck range continued in production under the MAN AG through to the late 1980s.
