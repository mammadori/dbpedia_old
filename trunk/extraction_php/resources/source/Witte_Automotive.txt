'''Witte Automotive''' develops and produces locking-, handle- and hinge systems for car doors, hatches and seats. 

Headquartered in Germany, Witte Automotive – also known as Witte-Velbert GmbH & Co. KG - is the European part of the Vast Alliance, the global automotive supplier alliance for vehicle access products. The privately held company was founded in 1899 by Ewald Witte. After WWII, Witte Automotive began manufacturing door brackets for the motorcar industry.

==Corporate Structure==

In addition to the headquarters Witte Automotive with Sales, R & D and Assembly in [[Velbert]], Germany, Witte Automotive in Nejdek, Czech Republic, is also a main part of Witte Automotive. Founded in 1992, this facility developed into a strong partner for assembling as well as for development know-how. The picture of Witte Automotive is completed by three companies, which contribute their expertise to the Witte-products: Krosta Metalltechnik (metal technology), Velbert, is the partner for stamped products and zinc die-casting, Riku Kunststoff (plastic injection molding), Bitburg, is the competence center for plastic components and Prinz Witte, Stromberg, develops and produces hinges.

==International Activities==

A license agreement with Great More, Taiwan, in 1993 was the beginning of the international activities. The VAST (Vehicle Access Systems Technology) Alliance, founded in 1999 with Strattec Security Corporation, Milwaukee, and extended in 2006 with Adac Automotive, Grand Rapids, is the foundation for the further global presence of Witte Automotive, which has developed with common joint ventures in Brazil, China, Japan and Korea.
