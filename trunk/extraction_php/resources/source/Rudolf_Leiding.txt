'''Dr. Ing. h.c. Rudolf Leiding''' ([[4 September]] [[1914]] – [[3 September]] [[2003]]) was the third [[post-war]] chairman of the [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen AG)]] automobile company, succeeding [[Kurt Lotz]] in 1971.

Leiding began his career with Volkswagen at Wolfsburg in 1945 where he was responsible for the repair of army vehicles.   [[Heinrich Nordhoff|Professor Nordhoff]] then charged him with setting up the first post[[Second World War|war]] Wolsburg assembly line, using such parts as he could find<ref name=Autocar197111/>.   Leiding's ingenuity at this task led to promotion, and Leiding found himself sent to the [[USA]] to oprganize the first VW service network there<ref name=Autocar197111/>.   Between 1958 and 1965 he was the first director of the VW works in [[Kassel]].  Subsequently he transferred to Auto Union GmbH in Ingolstadt where he became chairman of the board, presiding during the company's development of the successful [[Audi 100]].   

Leiding arrived at the top Volkswagen job with a reputation as a successful trouble-shooter.  When Volkswagen under Nordoff acquired [[Auto Union]]/[[Audi]], Leiding was sent to "sort out" morale and discipline, as general manager at the Ingolstadt plant<ref name=Autocar197111>{{cite journal| authorlink = Edouard Seidler | title = Upheaval of an empire: How Lotz went out and Leiding came in| journal = [[Autocar]]| volume = vol 135 (nbr 3947)| pages = pages 44 - 47|date = date 25 November 1971}}</ref>.  During his first week he took to standing at the plant entrance each day at 7 am in order to check on late arrivals for the morning shift, a technique he subsequently employed at other plants<ref name=Autocar197111/>.   Finding a compound filled with 28,000 unsold, unused and increasingly obsolete  cars, he sent office staff onto the street to "get rid of them at any cost"<ref name=Autocar197111/>.    Many friends and relations of Ingolstadt based Audi employees acquired bargain unused cars as a result of the exercise<ref name=Autocar197111/>.    Demand for the Ingolstadt plant's output did not justify a night shift at this time, and Leiding took to walking through the plant at night in the company of a photographer<ref name=Autocar197111/>.    The next day departmental heads responsible for areas where examples of inefficiency or waste had been identified would receive photographs of the deficient work stations, with no comment beyond the signature of the general manager<ref name=Autocar197111/>.   It was reported that during his first year at Ingolstadt Leiding reduced production costs by 34%<ref name=Autocar197111/>.

In July 1968, Leiding left [[Auto Union|Ingolstadt]] to take on the chairmanship of Volkswagen of Brazil.   His time in [[Sao Paulo]] saw the development of the [[Volkswagen SP2]] to be launched in 1972, one year after he went back to Germany to assume his position as VW CEO.  Over the space of three years from 1968 to 1971 he also achieved, a 50% increase in Volkswagen's Brazilian production.

[[File:Volkswagen EA266 prototype Beetle replacement.JPG|thumb|300px|right|One of Leiding’s first actions on assuming the top job at Wolfsburg was the cancellation of Development Project 266, a near launch-ready mid-engined air-cooled model intended to replace the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Beetle]], and pictured here.   Despite the luke-warm reception of Volkswagen retailers and service outlets to the recently introduced front engined water cooled [[Volkswagen K70]], Leiding instead bet the company’s future on the [[Fiat 128|Fiat-inspired]] fwd configuration, using the [[Audi 80]] project as a template for the successful Pole/Golf/Passat ranges.]]Less than three weeks after taking over from Lotz at Wolfsburg, Leiding halted work on EA266 (Development Project 266).   This was the development of a sophisticated - from a production engineer's standpoint over-sophisticated - mid-engined successor to the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Beetle]] being developed by Porsche on Volkswagen's behalf.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197710>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ferdinand Simoneit | title = Editorial: Schmücker sollte Leiding danken| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 10 1977| pages = Seite 3 |date = date 11 May 1977}}</ref>   The move was hugely contentious at the time partly because the Beetle replacement project was well advanced: 16 Million Marks had already been invested in EA266.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197710/>  It was culturally contentious because it hinted at a rejection of the company's historical roots.   Given the market's luke warm reception to newer rear engined air-cooled models such as the [[Volkswagen Type 4|Volkswagen 411]], Leiding's decision to use [[Audi 80#B1 (1972–78)|Audi]] products then in the pipe-line as a short-cut for Volkswagen to follow Europe's pace-setter manufacturers such as, above all, [[Fiat 128|Fiat]] down the water-cooled front-engined front-wheel drive route makes perfect sense in the light of subsequent events. But contemporaries lacked the hindsight necessary for that judgement.  Leiding's reward was the privilege of presiding over Volkswagen's record 1974 loss of DM 800 Million as the market-place appetite for Beetles finally stalled: his [[Toni Schmücker|successor]] reaped the reward of a DM 1,000 Million profit two years later in 1976.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197710/>

Under Leiding's leadership, the [[Volkswagen Golf]] was completed, and went on sale in [[Europe]] in June 1974, introduced in [[North America]] as the Rabbit seven months later.  The Golf was credited with saving VW from possible bankruptcy after the company had relied on the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] too long.

Rudolf Leiding left the company early in 1975 and was replaced by [[Toni Schmucker|Toni Schmücker]].<ref name=Motor197501>{{cite journal | authorlink = David Hardcastle|title = Motor Week: VW chief to make cuts| journal =[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]| volume = nbr 3772| pages = page 21 | date = 25 January 1975}}</ref>  

He died on 3 September 2003, one day before his 89th birthday.
