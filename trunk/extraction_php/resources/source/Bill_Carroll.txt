'''Bill Carroll''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] broadcast personality and currently the host of ''The Bill Carroll show'' from 09:00 to 13:00 on [[CFRB (AM)|CFRB 1010]] in [[Toronto]]. He also hosts Sundays from time to time at [[KFI]] radio in [[Los Angeles]].

==Background==
Carroll was born in [[Scotland]] and grew up in [[Coatbridge]] near [[Glasgow]].  He came with his family to [[Canada]] in the late 1960s. The family first lived in [[Don Mills, Ontario]] in an apartment (later in a townhouse in [[Scarborough, Ontario]]), where he attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute, a few years before [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]].

==Career==
Out of high school in 1980, Carroll moved to [[New Liskeard, Ontario]]. "My first job was as ''news director'' for the station [[CJTT-FM|CJTT]]. This meant I was also the morning news anchor and the news reporter â€” I was a one-man department. But it was a great place to learn about [[broadcast journalism]]. "I hadn't formally studied journalism, so once I got the job I bought every book on broadcast journalism I could find. At night I would study to be a broadcast journalist, and practice during the day." Bill was the co-host of [[MuchMusic]]'s game show spoof ''[[Test Pattern (TV series)|Test Pattern]]'', along with [[Dan Gallagher]].  After a stint in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], he joined [[CILQ-FM|Q107]] in Toronto, on a news program named "Barometer". He subsequently worked at its sister station [[CFMJ|TALK 640]] as morning host, before joining [[CFRB]] in 1998; first as a weekend newscaster and entertainment reporter, then as news director, before assuming his talk show.

In October 2004, Carroll was named to host [[CIII-TV|Global Television]]'s ''Focus Ontario'', a weekly public affairs show. His tenure there lasted until fall 2005, when he was replaced by Sean Mallen.

Carroll also teaches a radio course at [[Seneca College]].

==Decrease in listeners==

The latest ratings -- under the new and still being refined PPM metering system -- has them down in 10th place.

Starting Oct. 5, Bill Carroll is out as morning man, the top position for a radio host. He moves to 9 a.m. The new guy on the morning hot seat is John Moore.

AM 640, which had a 4.3 share of the market and CFRB, which had a 3.2. I see CHUM FM leads with a 17.5, closely followed by Q107 with a 12.2 and CHFI with 11.7

==News==
===FLICK-OFF Campaign===

On April 26, 2007 the Ontario Provincial government launched a new environment campaign with a slogan "FLICK-OFF". The phrase resembled the derogatory phrase ''fuck off'' (because the 'L' and the 'I' together could be perceived as a 'U'). Carroll claimed children will see the derogatory word, sending the wrong message.  He sarcastically told the government and some callers to Flick-off on live radio. 

===Switch over===
On December 15, 2006, it was announced on ''The Six O'clock News Hour'' that Bill Carroll would be replacing [[Ted Woloshyn]] as host of ''The Morning Show'' starting January 2007. Woloshyn had announced that very morning that he was resigning, after celebrating his tenth anniversary as CFRB Morning host (following [[Wally Crouter]]'s 50 year tenure).<ref>[http://www.cfrb.com/node/453232 A New Morning for a New Year, CFRB, 15 December 2006]</ref>

However, Carroll unlike Woloshyn, show starts at 6:00 am instead of 5:30 am. His show ends at 10:00 am instead of 8:30 am. This was announced on January 3, 2007.

===Impersonation===
On February 2, 2007, fellow talk show host [[Jim Richards (Canadian broadcaster)|Jim Richards]] found out that an unknown man was impersonating himself and Carroll in chatrooms. Richards later talked to the man during his show. The impersonator, had pictures of Carroll's children, wife, himself and parents. He sent these to people in his chatrooms as verification that it was really Carroll and Jim. There were harsh words exchanged as Jim Richards did not discuss the impersonator with Carroll. Carroll found out from a listener, and had later discussion on and off the air with Richards. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

===Lawsuit===
In March 2007, [[Tim Hortons]] filed a defamation lawsuit against Carroll, [[Standard Radio]], which owned CFRB, and [[CanWest]] for his allegations on CFRB and Global TV that the Canadian taxpayers were footing the bill for its well-publicised franchise in Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2007/03/02/3685041-sun.html Tims serves up lawsuit, Edmonton Sun, 2 March 2007]</ref>

Carroll said on his Global TV commentary: "Tim Hortons has been sliding by on the great publicity about the Kandahar franchise all these months and then Global uncovers the dirty little secret. You and I, the taxpayers, are picking up $4 or 5 million dollars a year so that they can look good to the public ... Shame on Tim Hortons."

Tim Hortons Inc. is seeking $35 million from all three for the false statement.<ref>[http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/News/2007/03/02/3684951-sun.html Double-double lawsuit launched, 24 Hours Vancouver, 1 March 2007]</ref>
Carroll further discredited himself in November 2009 by spending his whole show panic mongering in regards to the swine flu vaccine. After reading of the death of a local youth to the flu, he spent his entire show accusing any parent that wouldn't be taking their children in for a shot of not caring if their kids lived or died. Maybe 1010 can schedule him for a remote broadcast at a crowded theatre, so he can spend his entire four hours on air screaming FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!!!!
