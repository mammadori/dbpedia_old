'''Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmaɪbax}}) (founded 1909) is a German luxury car manufacturer. It was founded in 1909 by [[Wilhelm Maybach]] with his son [[Karl Maybach]] as director. The company was originally a [[subsidiary]] of [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin]] [[GmbH]] and was itself known as "Luftfahrzeug-Motoreinbau GmbH" (literally "Aircraft Engine Installation Company") until 1918.  Today, the brand is owned by [[Daimler AG]] and based in [[Stuttgart]].

==1909–1940: Early history==

Maybach has historic roots through the involvement of Wilhelm Maybach, who was the technical director of the [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft]].  The company originally developed and manufactured diesel and gas engines for [[Zeppelin]]s, and then rail cars. The [[Maybach Mb.IVa]] was used in aircraft and airships of [[World War I]].

The company first built an experimental car in 1919, with the first production model introduced two years later at the Berlin Motor Show.  Between 1921 and 1940, the company produced various classic opulent vehicles.  The company also continued to build heavy duty diesel engines for marine and rail purposes.

Maybach contributed to the German [[Nazi]] war effort in [[World War II]] by producing the engines for many self-propelled guns and tanks. This included such as the [[Jagdpanther]], [[Panther tank|Panther]] and [[Tiger tank]]s with the [[Maybach HL230]]. After the war the factory performed some repair work, but automotive production was never restarted, and some 20 years later, the company was renamed into [[MTU Friedrichshafen]].

==1997–present: revival==
In 1997, Mercedes-Benz presented at the Tokyo Motorshow a luxury concept car under the name '''Mercedes-Benz Maybach''' (V12, 5987 cc, 550 hp). Mercedes-Benz decided to develop it; however, Mercedes made the decision to market the car under the sole brand name of Maybach.

[[Image:Maybach 62 BMK.jpg|right|thumb|Maybach 62]]

Maybach was therefore revived as a brand in the early 2000s, with the production of the new model in two sizes — the [[Maybach 57 and 62|Maybach 57 and the Maybach 62]]. The numbers are equal to the lengths of the automobiles in decimetres. In 2005, the new 57S was added, sporting a 6.0L V12 [[bi-turbo]] engine,  producing {{convert|604|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Auto ft.lbf|737|0}} of torque, and featuring various cosmetic touches.

The company offers various options for customers to personalise their vehicles, and provides various equipment combinations.

To promote the new Maybach line, [[Mercedes-Benz]] has tapped public figures to act as [[brand ambassador]]s, including Maybach heir [[Ulrich Schmid-Maybach]] and golfer [[Nick Faldo]].<ref name="ulrich">Ryono, Debra.

===Future models===
Three new models are expected, a 4-seat sedan derived from the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class, a full-size luxury SUV derived from the [[Mercedes-Benz GL-Class|GL-Class]], and a smaller sedan, which would be sold for $250,000. Recently, they launched a [[Landaulet]]  convertible like the Maybachs of old and this was first shown in [[Dubai]][http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Apr07/26_A_Look_Ahead_Maybach_Discusses_Future_Plans_With_Automobile_Magazine.html]

With less than stellar sales expectations and heavy impact of 2008 financial crises, Daimler AG is considering cancelling the whole Maybach division. However, Daimler AG has been in talks with Aston-Martin to engineer and style the next generation of Maybach models along with the next generation of Lagonda models. Both are to be based on a new Maybach chassis. No release date is given.
