The '''Audi A1''' is a [[supermini car|supermini]]-class car expected to be launched by [[Audi]] at the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. Sales of the initial 3-door A1 model are anticipated to start in continental Europe in the summer of 2010, followed by the United Kingdom in September 2010. A 5-door A1 Sportback model is also expected to be launched later.<ref name="car"/>

The A1 was previewed at the 2007 [[Tokyo Motor Show]] in the form of the '''Audi metroproject quattro ''' [[concept car]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=123092|title=2007 Tokyo Auto Show Preview: Audi metroproject Quattro|work=[[Edmunds.com]] Inside Line|date=2007-10-19}}</ref>  The concept seats four and features a new hybrid powertrain.  With this powertrain, a {{Auto L|1.4|1}} {{convert|148|bhp|kW|1|abbr=on}} Turbos FSI engine drives the front wheels via a 6-speed [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-Tronic]] [[manual transmission]], while a {{convert|40|bhp|kW|1|abbr=on}} electric motor provides power to the rear wheels.  The electric motor is also capable of producing {{Auto ft·lbf|148|1}} of torque.

The metroproject quattro is able to travel {{convert|62|mi|km}} at up to {{convert|62|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on one charge of its [[lithium-ion]] batteries, which reduces fuel consumption by up to 15%. Both power sources are available to use simultaneously, with the driver then benefiting from [[McPherson strut]] front and four-link rear suspension configuration, electromechanical speed-sensitive power steering with a low energy draw, Audi magnetic ride adaptive damping technology, and 0-62&nbsp;mph in just 7.8 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/10/23/tokyo-motor-show-audi-a1-metroproject-quattro-concept/|title=Tokyo Motor Show: Audi metroproject quattro concept|date=2007-10-23|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>

At the 2008 [[Leipzig]] Auto Mobil International show, Audi again presented the metroproject quattro, renamed the '''A1 project quattro'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourtitude.com/news/publish/Audi_News/printer_3878.shtml|title=Audi at the AMI in Leipzig: A Spectacular Array of Premiers|work=Fourtitude|date=2008-04-02|accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> The vehicle was designed by Audi AG Project Designer in Exterior Design [[Dany Garand]], who also presented the design during the car's Hong Kong debut.<ref>[http://www.audi.com.hk/audi/hk/en2/about_audi_ag/news/local_news/audi_design_media.html Audi Design Media Workshop Reveals Brand’s Design Creativity]</ref>

==A1 Sportback concept==
[[Image:Audi A1 Sportback 001.JPG|thumb|right|Rear shot of the Audi A1 Sportback Concept at the 2008 Paris Motor Show]]
Audi unveiled a second A1 concept car at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in October 2008. The '''A1 Sportback concept''' is a restyled 5-door development of the metroproject quattro. Like the earlier concept, the A1 Sportback has a hybrid powertrain, with the same 1.4 L petrol engine and S-Tronic dual-clutch transmission, plus a 20&nbsp;kW (27&nbsp;bhp), 150 N·m electric motor. However the electric motor drives the front wheels, rather than the rear. Quoted 0-100 km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph) acceleration is 7.9 seconds and average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are given as 92 g/km. The A1 Sportback retains the dimensions of the Metroproject quattro, except for a slightly greater length, at 3.99 m.
