'''Opel Blitz''' was the name given to various German light and middle-weight [[truck]]s built By [[Opel]] between 1930 and 1975.

During the years preceding the [[Second World War]] Opel was Germany's largest truck producer.   The Blitz name was first applied to an Opel truck in 1930 and by 1934 there were four base versions offered of the 1 tonne model along with fourteen versions of the larger 2/2Â½ tonne trucks.

From 1939 onwards the 3-ton version was used frequently throughout [[World War II]], among other things as service vehicle for the [[Messerschmitt Me 323]].

A half-tracked version, using tracks and suspension based on that used on the [[Universal Carrier]], was also produced as the ''Opel Maultier'' (mule). In Europe this car was considered as [[General Motors|GM]]'s contribution to German successes.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

From 1973 to 1987 a successor vehicle produced by [[Bedford Vehicles]] of [[Luton]], and based on the [[Bedford CF]], was sold in some markets as the "Bedford Blitz".
