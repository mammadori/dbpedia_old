The '''Opel Flextreme''' is a diesel [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle|plug-in hybrid]] [[concept car]] created by [[Opel]]. It can travel {{convert|55|km|mi}} on its [[lithium-ion battery]] before a small [[diesel engine]] starts charging the battery (it is a [[series hybrid]]). The Flextreme uses the same platform and technology as the [[Chevrolet Volt]]. In January 2008, a rebadged version of the concept was introduced at the [[North American International Auto Show]] as the '''[[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] Flextreme'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autotrends.org/concepts/saturn/|title="The Saturn Flextreme: Now Thatâ€™s Unusual!" in ''Auto Trends''|accessdate=May 15 2008|dateformat=mdy}}</ref> In order to expand on different ways of recharging the battery on the [[GM E-Flex platform]], GM created the [[Cadillac Provoq]] to recharge itself using a [[hydrogen fuel cell]], in addition to the onboard gasoline, E85, and diesel engines found in the other concepts.
The [[Opel]] Flextreme is expected to emit 40 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per km or less (according to European test procedure ECE R101 for range extender vehicles).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/news/pk/pk_07.12.17_flextreme/EN_2_Flextreme_Technology.doc|title="Opel Media Information"|accessdate=October 3 2008|dateformat=mdy}}</ref> It is expected to reach approximately {{convert|153|mpgUS|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}
