The history of the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] in [[Mexico]] begins in March [[1954]]<ref>[http://mx.volkswagen.com/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/es_mx/empresa/enviroment/Historia.html Volkswagen de México Website "Nuestra Historia" ("Our History" ''in Spanish")]</ref><ref>[http://www.oocities.com/volkswagen_mx/historia.htm Geocities.com History of Volkswagen in Mexico ''(in spanish)'']</ref><ref>[http://www.projektomotor.com/articulos.php?id_sec=9&id_art=72&id_ejemplar=7 "Sedán dice adiós" ("Beetle says good bye") Projekto Motor Mexican magazine online article 01.08.2003 ''(in spanish)'']</ref><ref>[http://www.terra.com.mx/articulo.aspx?articuloId=65427 "La historia de VW en México" ("The history of Volkswagen in Mexico") Online article from [[Automóvil Panamericano]] mexican car magazine Consulted on 08.04.2009]</ref>, inside the exhibition "Alemania y su Industria" (Germany and its Industry). For this purpose, four different Volkswagen vehicles are brought to Mexico through [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz City]] for the first time. Those vehicles were: two Sedans ''113'' in "Export" trim, a convertible, and a Bus in luxury trim.

[[File:VW Kever "Ovaaltje" (foto-Mo).jpg|thumb|250px|This car is similar to the first [[Volkswagen Beetle]]s imported to [[Mexico]] back in 1954.]]

At this time, the Mexican car market was mostly compounded by American makes and models with large sizes and large engines which made a huge contrast with this german proposal. This exhibition was realized in the [[Ciudad Universitaria]] in Mexico City, during this event, the vehicles were widely admired by the public. The Volkswagen Beetles displayed there were the model with the "oval window". Former mexican president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] made a trip from [[Michoacán]] just to meet this peculiar vehicle. The local press immediately published the news into eight columns under the title ''"The People's Man" with the "People's Car"''.

== First steps in Mexico ==
[[File:VW 1965 ftl.JPG|thumb|220px|left|1965 1200 Volkswagen Beetle. Front view.]]
Still in that year, doubts arose about its long-term durability, so three weeks before the [[Carrera Panamericana]], Prince Alfonso de Hohenlohe (descendant of a friend of [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and car enthusiast resident of [[Mexico City]]), decided to participate with 7 sedans in the tough competition of 3211&nbsp;km looking forward to show their quality and liability. At the end of the race the seven Beetles finished the race, although not in the first places, those cars had 4 cylinder engines 1.2 L, contrasting with the eight-cylinder engines the rest of competitors had. Some newspapers reported  rumors that the engines were [[Porsche]] instead of [[Volkswagen]]. An expert mechanic from [[Houston]], [[Texas]] was requested to revise the cars, certifying that the cars had original and unmodified Volkswagen engines.
This led to the creation of the company '''Volkswagen Mexicana, S.A.''', in the same year also Hohenlohe founded the ''Distribuidora Volkswagen Central, S.A. de C.V.'', which opened its doors the following year, being the first Volkswagen dealer stablished in Mexico.

[[File:VW 1965 tras.JPG|thumb|220px|1965 1200 Volkswagen Beetle. Rear view.]]

In this year were ensambled the first 250 cars through [[Chrysler de México|Automex]] (later [[Chrysler]] de México). In the month of june is signed a contract with [[Studebaker-Packard Corporation|Studebaker-Packard]] de México to ensamble the '''[[Volkswagen Beetle]]''', which would be imported from Germany in the form of CKD-Kits. This agreement is valid until october 1961. Those cars already had the rectangular rear window.

The next year, in [[1962]] a first Volkswagen assembly plant is stablished in Xalostoc, [[Mexico State]], which receives the name '''PROMEXA''' (Promotora Mexicana de Automóviles - Mexican Automobile Promotor), starting activities in june this year, at a rate of 10 ensambled units per day.

In January [[1964]] '''[[Volkswagen de México|Volkswagen de México, S.A. de C.V.]]''' is stablished.

In June [[1965]] began the construction of the new Volkswagen plant located in the suburbs of [[Puebla, Puebla]], in a field of 2 million square meters. At that time the production made in Xalostoc was insufficient for the growing demand.

== Start of production in Puebla ==
[[File:Volkswagen Sedán 1968.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A 1968 Volkswagen Beetle, produced in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla City]]. Note the "VW 1500" badge.]]

On [[October 23]], [[1967]] the first [[Volkswagen Beetle]] rolls out from the assembly line at the Puebla plant. In mid 1968, the car has the 1.5 L engine replacing the previous 1.2 L the Volkswagen Beetles sold in México had, a "VW 1500" badge in the is also new . Next year, on [[June 12]], [[1968]] the Beetle number 100,000 in Mexico is produced.

For the [[1970]] model year, the Volkswagen Beetle has new bumpers, a new engine cover featuring two lateral groups of five ventis each, as well as new rounded headlights with their characteristic chromed molding, resulting in a very similar model to the 1967 German Beetle. The only exceptions are that the Mexican Beetle keeps the old body with the small windows as seen in german models before 1965, as well as the stamped steel wheels, as well as steel wheels with five pinch, giving this similarity to most Brazilian models at that time.

[[File:DSCN076.JPG|thumb|220px|Dashboard of the first Beetles produced in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].]]

In [[1971]] the 200,000th Mexican Volkswagen Beetle is produced. In the same year, the Volkswagen Sedán is selected by the "Departamento del Distrito Federal" to serve as a public transportation vehicle, introducing this way the ''Minitaxi'' in [[Mexico City]]. Also, exportations to [[Costa Rica]] and Europe begin.

In [[1972]] the Volkswagen Beetle received the new body with larger windows, which was available in German models since 1965. The tail lights are also new. They are larger than the ones used in previous models, being the same found in the german models ''1300'' and ''1302''.

The [[1973]] is one of the most popular in the Mexican Volkswagen Beetle, due the large amount of important improvements received. New 15" wheels with four pinch were placed into the car. They are covered by newly designed flat hubcaps instead the previous "bowl type" ones. The feeding gasoline mouth changed its placement being moved from the front trunk interior to the right outside the body, just above the right front fender. Inside, a new matt black dashboard is available, resulting in a greater comfort and less eye fatigue. The wiper/washer control is also moved from a button placed in the dashboard into a new position located in a lever on the right of the steering column.

Later this year, there is a second phase, in which additional improvements appear in the Beetle: A new 4 arm black steering wheel makes its debut among other modifications.

In [[1974]] further modifications were fitted into the Mexican Beetle: a new 1.6 L engine producing 44 HP SAE (50 PS DIN) replaced the previous 1.5 L, over the front fenders there are larger blinkers (identical to the ones which equipped the american spec Beetles), while there are new round and larger taillights (as seen in the ''1303'' -Super Beetle-), the engine cover remains unchanged, but it has no longer any badge. Inside, the front seats have a new design, and the whole interior is now black, replacing the previous grey tones. There is also a new lever which opens the front trunk from inside the glovebox.

In [[1975]] the engine cover is again replaced: The vents go now in four groups with five vents in the center, and seven groups of vents in the sides. This is the same engine cover already seen in the German models ''1302'' and ''1303'' (Super Beetle in the US). In June, the 500,000th Beetle is produced. There are two limited editions: The Volkswagen Beetle ''Jeans'' and the Volkswagen Beetle ''Sport Jeans'' featuring special wheels and specific paint colors. From this year, the chrome wheel caps are reserved only to the ''Volkswagen Sedan equipped'', unlike the base model which has no such caps.

In [[1977]] the most important modification is that the front blinkers are now located in the front bumper. With the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1#Caribe (Mexico) (1977–1987)|Caribe]], the Beetle receives some of the colours from this new car. The vinyl upholstery is discontinued, leaving as the only option a cloth–vinyl upholstery.

== Export to Europe ==
{{Copyedit|section|date=August 2009}}
From [[1978]] the Volkswagen Beetle has new vents located in the front trunk cover to take fresh air to the car's interior; this air leaves the car through a couple of rear vents located behind the rear side windows. Besides, hub caps disappear from the equipment list in all versions. From this year and due to the cancellation of its production in [[Germany]], the Mexican Volkswagen Beetle began to be exported to some European markets including: [[West Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Holland]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], among others. This new exportation model has some differences against the Mexican market Beetle: Its engine is a 1.2 L 34 CV DIN, on its exterior, the engine cover is lack of vents, being similar to German-produced VW 1200, and mexican market Beetles sold before 1970; in addition, its rear window is sightly larger one or two inches higher than mexican market Beetles. From this year, metallic paint colors are optional; some of the optional colors available were ''Silver Metallic'', ''Copper Red Metallic'', ''Cadmium Blue Metallic'' and ''Viper Green Metallic'', colors also available on the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1#Caribe (Mexico) (1977-1987)|Caribe]], and this last one actually is available again on the new European market [[Volkswagen Scirocco#Third generation (2008-present)|Volkswagen Scirocco]], as a reminder from the late 1970s decade.

[[File:Volskwagen Beetle 2.jpg|thumb|280px|left|1980 Volkswagen 1200L. Produced in Mexico for Europe. Front view.]]
In September [[1980]] rolled out from the production lines the one millionth Mexican-made Volkswagen Beetle.

In [[1981]] the ''Volkswagen'' (from now on it will be known this way by the manufacturer), receives, as a law requirement, new front seats with integreated headrests as well as new cloth upholsteries. Those new seats have the same design to some Volkswagen vehicles previously seen in Europe and the States in the late 60s in cars like the US-spec Beetles, type 3, and Bus. From now on, the ''Volkswagen'' has only two different keys: A master key (which now has the same ribbon finish already seen in the Rabbit/Golf) which opens the passenger doors, the engine cover and the car's ignition; and a second key, which is smaller, opens the fuel tank; outside the car, the hubcaps (which are once again series equipment) have now a matt grey finish, giving this the ''Volkswagen'' a modernity and discresion air. This year also, is new the emergency lights button on the dashboard (not available previously in Mexico). In addition, from this year, the ''Volkswagen'' has halogen H4 headlamps as series equipment. On [[May 15]], [[1981]] the 20 millionth worldwide produced Volkswagen Beetle is produced by Volkswagen de México. For this reason, a commemorative limited edition goes on sale; it is painted in Silver metallic and has the same lower side stripes already seen on the [[Volkswagen Jetta#First generation|Jetta]]. At this time is when its popular nickname appears in Mexico: The '''Vocho'''.

For the [[1983]] model year, the ''Volkswagen'' received new front seats with adjustable headrests, already seen in cars such the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1#Caribe (Mexico) (1977-1987)|Caribe]] and the [[Volkswagen Jetta#First generation|Atlantic]]. A new device is the hand brake light on the dashboard. In this year appeared a limited edition painted in ''Aubergine Metallic'' color. This new one is very attractive due its wheels painted in body color as well as its seats upholstered in tweed Grey and Aubergine.

In [[1984]] was the marque's 30th anniversary in [[Mexico]], for this reason, two commemorative limited editions are launched: The first one is a ''Volkswagen'' painted in Alpine White with the side lower stripes already seen in the 20 millionth edition , its upholstery is red velour with sides and door panels in black vinyl. The second one is even more peculiar, it is a Yellow painted ''Volkswagen'', with yellow velour upholstery, with sides and door panels in white color, however, elements such as the dashboard, the armrests, the rear ashtray and the interior rubber mat keep its typical black color.

In [[1985]] exportations to Europe end. An Special Edition called the ''Jubilée Käfer'' is launched. Its color is Grey Metalllic. It has special design steel wheels (as seen in some convertible models in the late 70's), and its engine is the  1.6 L 50 CV, this edition was only available in the european markets where the mexican Beetle was sold. At this time, the mexican market ''Volkswagen'' receives the exportation model rear window.

[[File:Volkswagen Sedán.jpg|thumb|280px|The ''Volkswagen'' ca. 1987.]]

In mid [[1986]] a new Limited Edition is launched in Mexico: The ''Volkswagen Europa Edition 1''. This is the first ''Volkswagen'' available in Mexico in many years painted in Black color, besides this special painting, this new Limited Edition has chrome hub caps (the norm in the 80's were matt finished hub caps), inside it had seats upholstered in a honeycomb black and white design with [[Recaro]] headrests, plus an AM/FM stereo cassette player radio (usually the only audio equipment available on mexican Beetles were the eternal ''Sapphire XI'' AM monoaural radio) with two speakers and a basket below the dashboard, as well as side and rear special badges. This year, the ''Volkswagen'' receives a "double diagonal" braking system, already seen in the Caribe, Atlantic and the [[Volkswagen Passat#Passat Mk2 (B2, 1981–1988)|Corsar]], this system is characterized by connecting the right front brake, with the rear left brake, and vice versa. In addition, the ''Volkswagen'' receives an intermitent modality in its wiper/washer system. However, the metallic colors are no longer available.

During [[1987]] appears a new Limited Edition: The ''Volkswagen Europa Edition 2''. The differences against the 1986 Edition 1 are: Its color is Grey Metallic, its front seats have normal headrests, though, they are now upholstered in grey tweed cloth with red and blue thin stripes, the basket below the dashboard is no longer available, but the Edition 2 gains tinted windows, being the first mexican Beetle available with such equipment, keeping also other details such as the chrome hub caps and its  AM/FM stereo cassette player radio.

== Price reduction and anti-pollution measures ==
For the [[1989]] model year, and due a government decree that required the company to cut the retail price, among other things, as well as a tax reduction, the mexican Beetle was relaunched as the ''Volkswagen Sedan''. This new model lost its wheel caps, as well as the body vents it had since 1978, also the fittings were of lower quality.

[[File:Volkswagen Sedán 1992 RBras.JPG|thumb|280px|left|1992 Volkswagen Sedán. In this car the Brazilian stamped steel wheels are observed. Those wheels were fitted in some units between 1992 and 1994.]]

In the [[1991]] model year, by guvernamental disposition, the Volkswagen Beetle features from now on a [[catalytic converter]], however, it keeps its [[carburator]], its electrical system with a generator and the old ignition system, witohout affecting its power and performance. In the passenger room, the dashboard receives new ligh and emergency lights switches, as well as a new two-arm steering wheel. Those elements come from the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|Golf]]. In addition, the Volkswagen Beetle has now anew alarm system as series equipment. Externally, this model differs due the rear bottom of its central body, which is now more rounded, the function of this feature is to make more space to accommodate the catalytic converter within the engine compartment. The exhaust system has only a single output, in contrast to the two outputs showed in the previous models.

For the [[1992]] model year the "Digifant" [[Fuel injection|electronic fuel injection]] replaces the carburator, therefore, outside (and first since 1973) is a n emblem on the cover of the engine (this time as an adhesive) with the legend ''1600i'' (see image in the gallery below). At this time, some of sedans have the velour upholstery from the Jetta GL in gray flannel, and a some of them were fitted with brazilian steel wheels, with a slightly different design than the one previously seen. These wheels are often found (but not as a rule) in some cars produced between 1992 and 1994.

In [[1993]] an electronic ignition system is introduced, and a new alternator replaces the eternal generator, giving greater air of modernity. On [[June 23]] this year is when the Volkswagen Beetle reached 21 million units produced throughout the world, at the [[Puebla de Zaragoza|Puebla]] plant, Volkswagen launched a new commemorative edition. This new limited edition is characterized by its side and rear anagrams "21 Million", its chrome wheel caps, and tinted windows. Inside, this new model has a light grey velour upholstery with stripes in discrete colors, and an AM/FM stereo cassette player audio system. This version was available in the following colors: ''Alpine White'', ''Tornado Red'', ''Steel Blue Metallic'', ''Turquoise Green Metallic'' and ''Satin Gray Metallic''.

in the same year, and to replace the "21 Million" edition a new ''Volkswagen Sedán GL'' is also introduced as a limited edition, it is also called the ''Volkswagen Sedán Wolfsburg Edition''. This edition is available only in three exterior colors: ''Steel Blue Metallic'', ''Satin Grey Metallic'' and ''Indian Red Pearl''. This version features a black velour upholstery and two outside mirrors.

[[1994]] is the year in which [[Volkswagen de México|Volkswagen]] celebrates its 40th anniversary in México, To commemorate, this year three new Limited Editions from the '' Vocho'' were launched:
* ''Volkswagen Firebeetle''. It is painted only in black. it has side and rear anagrams "Firebeetle" surrounded with flames and it had 15" allow wheels. Inside the car there is a black cloth upholstery with red stripes, and a AM/FM stereo cassette player radio.
* ''Volkswagen Beetle Edition One'' It is painted in Pink Metallic, with an anagram "Edition One" on the engine cover. It has two outside mirrors and chromed hub caps. Its upholstery is a beige cloth with pink embroidery.
* ''Volkswagen Beetle 40th Anniversary'' It is painted in a specific beige tone for this model, as well as the "Edition One" it has two outside mirrors and chromed hub caps. It has a commemorative anagram on the engine cover. Its upholstery is a beige cloth with multicolor embroidery.

== December mistake and sales decline ==
[[File:Sedan Jeans.jpg|thumb|280px|1995 Volkswagen Beetle Jeans. rear view.]]
[[File:HarlekinKaefer.jpg|thumb|280px|left|1996 Volkswagen Beetle Harlekin. Side view. This unit was photographed in Europe. Its original hub caps are matt finished.]]

[[1995]] is a very important year for the Mexican ''Vocho'', because many improvements were fitted into the car, like: New front disc brakes, new automatic front seat belts, new fixed rear seat belts, and a new anchor for the rear seat back, among a total of 87 improvements have been made Volkswagen announced. There are three new colors available: ''Bright White'', ''Verona Red'', and ''Black'' (this latter color has been previously available in some limited editions, but this is the first time in which this color is adopted by regular models). This year, and looking forward to increase the sales in so adverse economical conditions in Mexico due the [[december mistake]] in 1995, a new Limited Edition is launched: El ''Volkswagen Beetle Jeans''. This new version, painted in ''Jean Blue'', has chromed hub caps, tinted windows, side and rear "Jeans" anagrams, and a blue jean upholstery on its seats.

[[1996]], the same way than 1973, is divided into two different phases on the Mexican Volkswagen Beetle history. On the first one all the characteristic chrome moldings are dropped. However, the door handles, side moldings, stirrups moldings and side mirrors, now have a black matte finish, the window moldings disappear completely. Bumpers and headlight moldings from now are painted the color of the car. The colors and clothes inside are unchanged from the 1995 model year.

The second phase of the 1996 model year is characterized by the complete dropping of all moldings of the ''Vocho''. Now we have two different versions available:
* ''Volkswagen Sedán City''.- This is a burget version with all the equipment reduced to a its minimum expression, disappearing from the equipment list elements such as: the door armrests, the automatic front seat belts, the rear seat belts, the front disc brakes, and the central bumper black stripe. This version is only available in ''Verona Red'' (from 1997 in ''Tornado Red'') and ''Bright White''. Its upholstery is new cloth with vinyl in ''Grey Frannel''. One way to distinguish the ''Volkswagen Sedán City'' is that the City has no Sedan black sticker on its bumpers, which is the norm in the rest of the Volkswagen Beetles. 
* ''Volkswagen Sedán Clásico''.- This version keeps all of the improvements implemented in 1995 to compensate for the loss of moldings, this model is equipped with grey hub caps in matt finish, black velour and black vinyl upholstery, four arm steering wheel (from the third generation [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3|Golf]] and [[Volkswagen Jetta#Third generation|Jetta]]) and the availability of more colors: ''Bright White'', ''Tornado Red'', ''Black'', and optionally, the ''Tornasol Silver Metallic'', ''Windsor Blue Metallic'', ''Classic Green Metallic'', ''Indian Red Pearl'' and ''Dusty Mauve Pearl'' (the latter only in 1996).

Derived from the ''Sedán Clásico'' goes on sale in mid 1996 the Liimited Edition ''Volkswagen Beetle Harlekin'', inspired in the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3#Mk3 Special Edtions|Golf Harlekin]] (sold in North American markets) and [[Volkswagen Polo Mk3#Polo Harlekin|Polo Harlekin]] (sold in European markets). This Beetle is characterized by having different colors in the different body parts, being used four different ones: Marine Blue, Green, Yellow and Red.

In [[1999]], the same way then 1996, there are two different phases: In the first one the Beetle keeps bring sold the same way as in previous years (Volkswagen Sedán City and Volkswagen Sedán Clásico), while in the second one, both versions are replaced by a new "unique" version, mostly referred as the ''Volkswagen Sedán Unificado'', which takes the City's upholstery, and the improvements and the metallic colors from the ''Sedán Clásico''. This new Volkswagen Beetle is the last regular version which remained unchanged until year [[2003]]. This year appears, in addition to the anti-theft alarm and with the intention of lowering the high index of thefts and therefore, the extraordinarily expensive premiums of insurance policies, the ''Transponder'', a device with an entry located in dashboard, which allows the ignition and operation of the car. When it is offline, the car may not even be started when using the ignition key.

[[File:Sedan Summer.jpg|thumb|280px|2002 Volkswagen Summer Beetle. Front view.]]

In year [[2000]], to commemorate the new millenium, two new Limited Editions are launched:
* ''Volkswagen Sedán Clásico''.- This new Limited Edition takes the moldings, mirrors and hubcaps with chrome finishings. Inside it has an anthracite coloured velour upholstery. The only color available is ''Indian Red Pearl''. It has side "Clásico" anagrams.
* ''Volkswagen Sedán Jeans''.- It is equipped with 15" allow wheels, and it has a new indigo blue jean upholstery. It has side and rear "Jeans" anagrams. Its color is ''Batik Blue Pearl''.

With the model [[2001]] there are new "tattoos" on windows, exterior mirrors and rear lights, in order to prevent the theft of these parts when the car is parked. These "tattoos" contains the last 8 alphanumeric characters that comprise the [[serial number]] of the car.

In the model [[2002]] one of the last limited editions is introduced, the ''Volkswagen Beetle Summer''. This is characterized by two special colors: A new shade of yellow, and a new shade of blue original from the european [[Volkswagen Lupo]]. Its chrome wheel caps contrasted with his monochrome scheme. Like other editions, the Beetle ''Summer'' has rear and side ''Summer'' anagrams.

== Volkswagen Sedán Última Edición ==

[[File:Volkswagen emblem.jpg|thumb|220px|Emblem with the coat of arms of [[Wolfsburg]] located in the trunk's lid. This badge was present in older models, and it's back in the ''Volkswagen Sedán Última Edición''.]]
[[File:Sedan Ultima Edicion.jpg|thumb|340px|left|2004 ''Volkswagen Sedán Última Edición''. Front view. Aquarius Blue with Grey interior.]]
In March [[2003]] the end of the ''Vocho'' production is announced, due to the gradual and continuous decline in demand for this model, which began with the introduction of the [[Opel Corsa#Opel Corsa B|Chevy Pop]] (Opel Corsa B) in Mexico produced by [[General Motors]] in 1997. The Chevy Pop replaced the Volkswagen Beetle in its first place on sales in Mexico by offering much more modernity at a price just a little higher than the Vocho, however, the Volkswagen Beetle kept being the mexican taxi driver favorite, until, in 2002, a decree merged in 2002 under the mandate of [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]], then [[Mexico City]]'s governor. This decree prohibited the granting of permits for public transportation in the form of [[taxi]]s in [[Mexico City]] to two door cars, restricting even more the marketing of the ''Vocho'' in favor of the [[Nissan_Tsuru#B13_.281991-1994.29|Nissan Tsuru]] (third generation Nissan Sentra), which now became the new favorite of taxi drivers in Mexico, so that sales of the ''Vocho'' fell even further. These sales figures reached over 40,000 units sold annually in the mid-90's, dropping to just over 10,000 in its last year. It was in the month of June 2003, when the '''Volkswagen Sedán Última Edición''' is introduced<ref>[http://www.terra.com.mx/articulo.aspx?articuloid=119110 "El último Vocho. A prueba" ''(The last Vocho. At test)'' Online article from the mexican car magazine [[Automóvil Panamericano]] ''(in Spanish)'' 04.08.2003]</ref>. A totally nostalgic car, which resembles the past glories of the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. This Final Edition consisted of 2,999 units for sale to the general public in Volkswagen dealers across Mexico, while one (the last one to be produced), would be immediately shipped to the Volkswagen Museum in [[Wolfsburg]], [[Germany]], testifying a historic age which ended on [[June 30]], [[2003]], when the last '''Volkswagen Beetle''' (the unit number 21'529,464) leaves the production line in what is now called "the hall of sorrow", accompanied by a [[Mariachi]] singing the song "Las Golondrinas" (A mexican folk song that speaks of a farewell). This latter Beetle was headed to the port of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] where a ship would take it to his final destination. The rest of the units, despiting costs [[Mexican peso|MXP]] $ 84,000.00 (an "Unified" Volkswagen Beetle costed MXP $ 74,000.00), moved very quickly from dealerships, leaving many people with the desire to own one of these copies. At this time, Volkswagen presented some advertisings with a nostalgic tone<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2849155582620142505&q=VW+Beetle Volkswagen Sedán Última Edición commercial ''(in Spanish)'']</ref>. In some of them showed a small space to park, and many cars that tried unsuccessfully to occupy it, after what appeared to get a sedan, then showed a sentence saying: ''"Es increíble que un auto tan pequeño deje un vacío tan grande. Adiós Sedán."'' (It is incredible that such a small a car leaves such a large emptiness. Goodbye Beetle). One of the curious events that occurred was the fact that a group of owners of dealerships in Mexico, came together to buy one of these cars, which was sent to the [[Vatican city]] as a present for Pope [[John Paul II]].<ref>[http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/90448.regala-mexico-al-papa-el-ultimo-vocho.html "Regala México al Papa el último 'Vocho'."

As the ''Volkswagen Sedán Última Edición'' rolled out from the production lines as a ''2004'' model, a limited number of "Unified" Beetles were also produced as 2004 model. When the last edition Beetle ran out, the  normal Volkswagen Beetle continued being available in most Volkswagen dealers in [[Mexico]] during the most part of year [[2004]], because if however, many fans were unable to get a Last Edition Beetle, did not want to have a normal ''Vocho'' in their garages. Others, however, chose to "convert" their vochos in Last Edition replicas. Even the [[Grupo Autofin México]] (who appointed itself as the largest group of car dealers in [[Latin America]]), took from its inventory a certain number of "unified Vochos" of various colors, which were fitted with 15" alloy wheels (not the originals of the Volkswagen brand) and leather upholstery, among other equipments.

At the time of sales, and subsequently, several units of the last Beetle have been exported from [[Mexico]] to many countries, mainly to North America and Europe, where it has become a cult car. Today, a ''Volkswagen Sedan Última Edición'', being the last representative of a lineage of more than 21 million units produced has increased its value as a collector car at the international level, reaching figures of up to USD. 15,000.00 in resale.
