Insignia is also the first [[production car]] to feature a dual-function frontal camera with [[traffic sign recognition]].

From launch, the Insignia offered a 1.6&nbsp;litre ''[[GM Family 1 engine|Family 1]]'' [[straight-four engine]] producing {{convert|85|kW|PS hp|lk=on}}, a 1.8&nbsp;litre version producing {{convert|103|kW|hp}}, a 2.0&nbsp;litre ''[[GM Family II engine#DI|Family II]]'' straight-four [[direct injection]] turbocharged petrol producing {{convert|162|kW|hp}}, a [[Holden]]-built 2.8&nbsp;litre ''[[GM High Feature engine#LP9 Turbo|High Feature]]'' turbo petrol [[V6 engine]] producing {{convert|191|kW|hp}}, and three turbocharged 2.0&nbsp;litre "CDTi" straight-four [[diesel engine]]s, producing {{convert|81|kW|hp}}, {{convert|96|kW|hp}} and {{convert|118|kW|hp}}. These CDTi diesels are derived from the Fiat/Opel [[JTD engine]]. 

The engine lineup was expanded in early-mid 2009 with a 1.6&nbsp;litre turbo petrol producing {{convert|132|kW|hp}} as well as a fourth variation to the 2.0&nbsp;litre "CDTi" diesel, producing {{convert|140|kW|hp}} in twin-turbo form.<ref name = "Innovative Opel Insignia Enlivens Traditional Mid-size Segment">{{cite web | date = 2008-07-22 | url = http://media.gm.com/featured_vehicles/Opel_Insignia2008.htm | title = Innovative Opel Insignia Enlivens Traditional Mid-size Segment | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2009-08-21}}</ref> The latter, engine code ''A20DTR'', has been delayed until at least 2011, as [[Saab]], who produces the unit in it's TTiD models is now no longer part of GM.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} All nine engines meet [[European emission standards|Euro 5 emissions standards]],<ref name = "Innovative Opel Insignia Enlivens Traditional Mid-size Segment"/> and all are offered with in [[front-wheel drive]] configuration; exceptions are the 2.8 petrol turbo and 2.0&nbsp;litre twin-turbo diesel which are offered with [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] by default. With the 2.0&nbsp;litre turbo, both propulsion forms are available. Six-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] transmissions are fitted throughout the range, although five-speed automatics are used on the 1.6 and 1.8&nbsp;litre petrol engines as well as the base diesel.

Also starting in 2009, a low-emissions 2.0&nbsp;litre ecoFLEX diesel variant is scheduled to commence sales. Using altered [[aerodynamics]] and motor control, the model's [[carbon dioxide]] emission will be below 140&nbsp;g/km, which corresponds to about 5.0&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km. Power outputs is rated at {{convert|118|kW|hp}}, however this engine and transmission deletes the opportunity to specify "FlexRide" as an option. Later on in 2009, a high-performance version of the 2.8&nbsp;litre V6 in twin-turbo form will be fitted to the [[Opel Performance Center]] (OPC) and [[VXR]] variants delivering {{convert|239|kW|hp}}.

The Opel Insignia was made available in European dealerships in October 2008. The following month, the Insignia was voted 2009 [[European Car of the Year]], beating the [[Ford Fiesta]] by one vote.<ref>{{cite news | last = Tan | first = Paul | url = http://paultan.org/archives/2008/11/17/vauxhall-insignia-wins-2009-car-of-the-year-award/ | title = Vauxhall Insignia wins 2009 Car of the Year award | date = 2008-11-17 | publisher = Paul Tan | accessdate = 2008-11-17}}</ref>

=== Buick Regal ===
The Insignia began production as the [[Buick Regal]] by [[Shanghai GM]] in November 2008. A North American version of the Regal is expected to begin production in [[Oshawa, Ontario]], [[Canada]] in late 2010, six years after the original had ended production.

=== Chevrolet Vectra === 
The European Insignia is sold in parts of Latin America as the [[Chevrolet Vectra]].

=== Vauxhall Insignia === 
'''Vauxhall Insignia''' is the United Kingdom-market version of the car; it is the first Vauxhall car to receive their new logo design, dispensing with the characteristic "V" grille that has adorned Vauxhall models since 1994. Vauxhall versions are produced in Exclusiv, S, SE, SRi and Elite specification levels.
