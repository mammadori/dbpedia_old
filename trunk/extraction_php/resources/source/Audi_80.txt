The '''Audi 80''' is a [[compact executive car]] produced by the [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry|car manufacturer]] [[Audi]], from 1966 to 1996.  It initially shared its platform with the [[Volkswagen Passat]], and was available as a [[sedan (automobile)|saloon car/sedan]], and an Avant (Audi's name for an [[station wagon|estate car/station wagon]]).  The [[coupé]] and [[convertible]] models were not badged as members of the range but shared the same platform and many parts.

In [[North America]] and [[Australia]], the 80 was sold as the '''Audi Fox''' for model years 1973–79, and as the '''Audi 4000''' for model years 1980–87.

The '''Audi 90''' was an upmarket version of the Audi 80.

There were several different [[internal combustion engine]] types, of which the [[petrol engine]]s included the fuel-injected "E" (Einspritzung), and carburetor "S", and the [[diesel engine]]s included "D" (Diesel), "TD" ([[turbodiesel|TurboDiesel]]), or "TDI" ([[Turbocharged Direct Injection]]).

==F103 (1966–69)==
Prior to Audi adopting the '''"80"''' nomenclature, the '''[[Audi F103]]''' series, based on the [[DKW F102]] and sold between 1965 and 1972, were named for their [[horsepower]] ratings.  From 1966 to 1969, the series included an Audi 80 model.

This model debuted in [[Europe]] in 1972 (with factory production starting in May 1972<ref>[[ETKA]] official factory figures</ref>) as the Audi 80, and in 1973 in [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] as the Audi Fox, and was available as either a two-door or a four-door saloon (sedan).  It effectively took the place of several models that Audi had discontinued (the F103 series, which included the first model designated as an "Audi 80"), and provided the company with a viable rival to the [[Opel Ascona]] and the [[Ford Taunus]].

The Audi 80 was first equipped with 1.3 and 1.5&nbsp;[[litre]] [[overhead camshaft#single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] [[straight-4]] [[petrol engine]]s.  The [[internal combustion engine]]s were available in various rated power outputs.  For the 1.3&nbsp;L engines, (identification code: ZA) was rated at {{convert|55|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}, code: ZF was rated at {{convert|60|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}.  The 1.5&nbsp;L (codes: ZB, ZC) at {{convert|75|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} for the ZB and {{convert|85|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} for the ZC.

On the home market, two- and four- door saloons were available in base trim (55 or 60&nbsp;PS, called simply Audi 80 and 80&nbsp;S, respectively), as L models (LS with 75&nbsp;PS engine) or as a more luxurious GL (85&nbsp;PS only).  In September 1973, Audi added the sporty 80&nbsp;GT (two-door only) featuring a carburetted 1.6 litre engine (code: XX) rated at {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}.

The Audi 80 had a [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension, and a C-section [[beam axle|beam rear axle]] located by [[trailing arm]]s and a [[Panhard rod]], and using coil springs and telescopic dampers.<sup>[[#endnotes|1]]</sup>

A [[facelift (automobile)|facelift]] in autumn 1976 brought about a revised front end in the style of the newly introduced [[Audi 100]] C2 with square instead of round [[headlamp|headlights]], 1.6 instead of 1.5&nbsp;litre engines (still of 75/85&nbsp;PS) and a new 80&nbsp;GTE model with a [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the 1.6&nbsp;litre ({{convert|110|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}}) replacing the former 80&nbsp;GT.

The Fox had a 1.5&nbsp;L engine rated at {{convert|55|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} attached to a four-speed [[manual transmission]].  Subsequent versions came with 1.6&nbsp;L engines rated at {{convert|83|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<sup>[[#endnotes|2]]</sup>

In certain markets a five-door "Avant" (Audi's name for an estate/wagon) variant was offered — effectively a rebadged [[Volkswagen Passat]] with Audi front panels.  The B1 platform was dropped from the European market in 1978, although it was sold into the 1979 model year in [[North America]].

Audi redesigned the 80 on the [[Volkswagen Group B platform#B2|B2 platform]] (''Typ'' 81) in 1978 in [[Europe]], and in 1979 (as a 1980 model) in [[North America]].  Audi continued to use the 80 nameplate in Europe, but began badging it as the '''4000/4000S''' in North America.  The body of the B2 Audi 80 was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]].  Although it was usually ordered as a four-door, a smaller number of two-door 80s were produced.  No Avant variant was available, as the [[Volkswagen Passat]] filled that role.

In Europe, the 80 was the standard model, while after a 1984 facelift the '''Audi&nbsp;90''' was launched as a larger-engined version of the 80; with more options, and, aside from the {{convert|70|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}, [[straight-4|four-cylinder]] 1.6l [[turbodiesel]] (TD) engine which was also available for the 80, two five-cylinder in-line [[petrol engine]]s — a 2.0 with {{convert|115|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} and a 2.2 with {{convert|136|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} which was later modified into a 2.3. The 2.2 was available with a catalytic converter and power ratings of  {{convert|115|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} for front-drive and {{convert|120|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} for quattro models.  European models had two [[automotive lighting|headlamp]] casings, while North American models generally had quad headlamps.

The B2 platform proved to be both quite versatile and quite profitable; many components were shared to or borrowed from the Audi Coupé, [[Audi Quattro]] and Audi Sport Quattro, which in the process helped to cement the company into the public eye after their [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system proved useful in various forms of racing.<ref name="Quattro25">Audi of America Press Site [http://media.audiusa.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=9540 25 Years of Audi Quattro] 22 February 2005</ref>

The saloons were offered until late 1986 in Europe and 1987 abroad, and the B2-based Audi Coupé lasted through to 1988 (as an early 1989 model) before being changed.  The Coupé shared many components, and its basic body shape, with the original Audi Quattro.

Mid-1984, for the 1985 [[model year]], Audi gave the B2 a subtle [[facelift (automobile)|facelift]] with tail lights resembling the ones of the ''Typ'' 44 Audi 100, and different front and rear bumpers and headlights and an updated interior. In Europe, engines with catalytic converter emissions controls were made available for the first time.

In 1983, the 80&nbsp;Sport was introduced in the UK, based on the GTE.  It came with quattro-style Ronal alloys, rubber rear spoiler, deep chin spoiler, striped charcoal [[Recaro]] interior, and optional body graphics including full-length "Audi Sport" stripes.  A special commemorative-edition version, the [[Audi 4000CS quattro]], was made for the 1985, 1986, and 1987 model years.

The '''Audi 5+5''' was launched on to the Australian market in October 1981.<ref>The Macquarie Dictionary of Motoring, 1986, page 23</ref>  Described as a “uniquely Australian Special” it was essentially an 80 B2 four door saloon with the 2144cc five cylinder engine.<ref>Motor Manual, February 1982, pages 54-57</ref>

[[Image:Audi 90q20v.jpg|thumb|left|Audi 90 quattro 20V]]
In September 1986, Audi released a new 80 for the 1987 [[model year]] on the [[Europe]]an market and was introduced elsewhere within a year.  It was based on the new [[Volkswagen Group B platform#B3|B3 platform]] (which broke the relationship with the Volkswagen B-series platforms, not being the same as the Passat's B3 platform).  Although often called the B3 even among knowledgeable Audi enthusiasts, the official and correct nomenclature was its production code ''Typ 89'' from 1987 to 1989, and ''Typ 8A'' from 1990 onwards.  It introduced a new [[aerodynamic]] look and a fully [[galvanizing|galvanised]] bodyshell.  This was the first [[mid-size car|mid-sized car]] to feature a fully zinc-coated body, giving it longevity and durability against corrosion perforation.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  This protective shield proved to be so effective that Audi extended its corrosion perforation warranty, which during early pre-production was expected to be good for only eight years, from the originally offered ten years to twelve years; Audi still uses zinc galvanisation for all current steel-bodied models.

Unlike its predecessor, the B3 was marketed worldwide only as Audi 80 or Audi 90.  For the most part, Audi transferred existing [[powertrain]] concepts to the new model, although [[fuel injection]] was now available for some engines.  A range of new [[petrol engine|petrol]] and [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[straight-4|inline four cylinder]] engines became available to European customers and the [[straight-5|inline five cylinder]] '''Audi 90''' was reintroduced as an upmarket, more luxurious variant of the standard model, much like earlier during the B2 (''Typ'' 81) series.  For all versions, the ''[[procon-ten]]'' safety system was now available and standard fitment from 1991.  The 90 differs visually by the full width tail-light panel / licence plate surround, its [[headlamp|headlights]] which featured additional high-beam lights and the front [[grille]] was also slightly different to the 80.  The indicators are in the bumpers next to a wider fog light than that of an 80.  The 90 also featured the first [[multi-valve|20 valve]] engine from Audi after the [[turbocharger|turbo]] engine used in the [[Audi Quattro#Sport|Audi Sport Quattro]].  This engine produced {{convert|170|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on|lk=on}}.

The [[United Kingdom]] and Europe had similar versions: the [[Volkswagen Group]] wanted to ensure consistency across all markets, so the trim levels were similar.  However, in North America, the range was more limited: a choice of 2.3&nbsp;E and 2.3&nbsp;quattro were available from 1988 to 1992.

Altogether, the Audi&nbsp;80 came with the following engine range, although not all of these were available outside Germany:

The Audi&nbsp;90 came with four different engines:
* 2.0&nbsp;E - {{convert|115|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, [[four-cylinder]] [[petrol engine]]
* 2.2&nbsp;E / 2.3&nbsp;E - {{convert|136|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, five-cylinder petrol engine
* 2.3&nbsp;E&nbsp;20v - {{convert|170|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, 20-valve five-cylinder petrol engine (with catalytic converter)

With the 1988 [[model year]], a new two-door [[Coupé]] was introduced in Europe, known internally as the ''Typ'' 8B; basically a B3 saloon with a shortened [[wheelbase]] and a modified rear end.  It came with the {{convert|115|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} 2.0&nbsp;E as well as the two 2.3&nbsp;E engines.  It later served as a basis for the B4 Coupé and Cabriolet (''Typ'' 8G).  These models dropped the "80" appendage and were simply known as '''Audi Coupé''' and '''Audi Cabriolet'''.  Because of the heavy re-engineering involved in the cabriolet version, this model was essentially carried on until the year 2000, long after the other B3 models had been replaced by B4 and even B5 vehicles.

In 1989, for the 1990 model year, North America received the Coupé&nbsp;quattro and 90&nbsp;quattro models that all were powered by a detuned {{convert|164|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} of the 20v 2.3&nbsp;L 5-cylinder engine.  These cars were considered to be in the "Grand Tourismo" (GT) style of a comfortable luxury car with sporting tendencies, as opposed to a dedicated lightweight sports car.  Weighing between {{convert|3042|lb|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} (1990 saloon/sedan model) to {{convert|3308|lb|0|abbr=on}} (1991 Coupé model), these cars were not lightweight, especially in consideration of the 164&nbsp;hp powerplant (slightly de-tuned from the European version).  These models can be recognised by their distinctive [[wheel|roadwheels]] (Coupé quattros had 15" 5-star "Speedline" wheels, sedan quattros had 14" BBS Mesh wheel or the 15" Speedlines).  They differed from regular 80/90 models in several ways.  Notable differences include their standard leather interiors with Zebrano wood trim, additional [[Siemens VDO|VDO]] gauges mounted in the bottom of the [[center console (automobile)|centre console]], a [[carbon fibre]] centre drive shaft,{{Fact|date=June 2009}} and push-button locking rear differential.  The Coupé&nbsp;Quattro is visually similar to the European-only S2 model, but does not have that S2's turbocharged engine.

The final B3 80s and 90s were sold as 1992 models in North America; in Europe, all B3s were discontinued at the end of the 1991 model year to give way to the B4 series; a few Audi&nbsp;90&nbsp;Sport&nbsp;Quattro with the 2.3&nbsp;L 20v engine are, however, known to have come off the assembly lines as late as early 1992.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

===Audi S2{{anchor|S2}}===
[[Image:Audi S2 green.jpg|thumb|left|Audi S2 Coupé]]
Audi developed a sports version of its' 80 / 90 in 1991, based on the B4 platform called the '''Audi S2'''.  This featured a 2.2&nbsp;[[litre]] in-line five cylinder [[multi-valve|20-valve]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] [[petrol engine]] derived from that used in the [[Audi Quattro#Sport|Sport Quattro]].  A similar version of the engine was used in the [[Audi 200]] 20v and the Audi 100 based S4 (the 'Ur-S4').  It came as standard with [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent four wheel drive, and featured a heavy-duty [[manual transmission]], initially five-speed, and then upgraded to a six-speed for 1993.

The Audi S2 was initially available only as a two-door [[sports car|sports]] [[coupé]], but later, in 1993, a five-door S2 Avant model was introduced, along with a limited run of four-door S2 [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] models, of which 306 were produced.  The S2 saloon and Avant are actually based on the next generation B4 platform, and feature a lot similarities in the rear axle support system to the later B5 A4 quattro.  The B4 platform S2 Avant was also used between 1993 and 1995 as the basis for Audi's [[Audi RS2 Avant|RS2 Avant]] super-sports estate, which was modified for Audi with assistance from [[Porsche]].

The S2 was initially available with a 2.2&nbsp;L turbocharged engine which produced {{convert|220|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} (code: 3B), with later models producing {{convert|230|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} (code: ABY).  It will accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in 5.8&nbsp;[[second]]s, continuing to a top speed of {{convert|246|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.  The S2 Avant reaches {{convert|100|km/h|1|abbr=on}} sprint in 6.1&nbsp;seconds, and has a top speed of {{convert|242|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.

The B3 obtained a major facelift for the 1992 [[model year]] in 1991.  It was from then on known internally as the B4 (or ''Typ'' 8C).  Changes from the B3 included a longer [[wheelbase]], a fully redesigned [[fuel tank]] and rear axle to enable the use of folding seats, 15" [[wheel|roadwheels]] with more prominent wheel arches, redesigned and painted rear and front bumpers, as well as higher-quality materials for the interior.  The front [[grille]] was merged with the bonnet and given a bolder look.

The B4 also marked the beginning of Audi's move into the German luxury mid-sized vehicle segment, which until then was clearly dominated by [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]].  On the [[Europe]]an market, and in [[Germany]] in particular, the B4 and its variants were highly successful and popular.

In Europe, the 90 name was discontinued, and all saloons were badged as 80, regardless of which engine they had.  Audi of America went the opposite direction, and began selling the saloon as the 90.  B4s for the American market typically offered more luxury even in the standard version, such as [[automatic transmission]], [[cruise control]], [[air conditioning]] and leather seats, all of which were merely optional at additional cost on European models.

Due to [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) specifications regarding [[headlamp]] and crash safety designs, the front of the B4 had to be specially redesigned for vehicles sold in North America.  Most importantly, the front bumper had to be designed to accommodate crash absorbers which were not required in Europe; as a result of these layout constraints, the North American variant of the B4, unlike European V6 models, had no dual H1/H4 headlamps, the indicator lamps (which unlike in Europe had to be orange) were placed next to the headlamps and not in the bumper, and the foglamps were made smaller and moved down to the corners of the bumper air duct.

European market cars were now available with a selection of [[straight-4|inline four cylinder]] engines, as well as the familiar [[straight-4|in-line five]], and two different new [[V6 engine]]s (2.6 and 2.8); the latter 2.8&nbsp;V6 was the only engine available for vehicles sold in North America.  As another first, Audi introduced a new high-[[torque]], [[Gasoline direct injection|direct-injection]], [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[diesel engine]], the {{convert|66|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} 1.9&nbsp;TDI ([[Turbocharged Direct Injection]]).  The standard 1.8&nbsp;[[litre]] [[petrol engine]] of the B3 was discontinued; a two-litre, {{convert|66|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, 4-cylinder petrol engine, a variation of the previously known {{convert|85|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} 2.0&nbsp;E engine, was now available for the base model.

Altogether, although some layouts were not available everywhere outside Germany, Audi offered the following engine range for the 80/90 B4:
:'''''[[Petrol engine]]s:'''''
* 1.6 - {{convert|74|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}, [[straight-4|in-line four-cylinder]]
* 1.8 E 20v - {{convert|92|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, in-line four-cylinder
* 2.0 - {{convert|66|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, in-line four-cylinder (base model in Germany)
* 2.0 E - {{convert|85|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, in-line four-cylinder
* 2.0 E 16v - {{convert|103|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, 16-valve, in-line four-cylinder
* 2.3 E 10v - {{convert|98|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, 10-valve, [[straight-5|in-line five-cylinder]]
* 2.6 E - {{convert|110|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, [[V6 engine|V6]]
* 2.8 E - {{convert|128|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, V6
* S2 - {{convert|169|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, 2.2L, 20-valve [[turbocharged]] in-line five-cylinder
* RS2 Avant - {{convert|232|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, 2.2L, 20-valve turbocharged in-line five-cylinder
:'''''[[Diesel engine]]s:'''''
* 1.9 TD - {{convert|55|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, [[straight-4|in-line four-cylinder]] [[turbodiesel]]
* 1.9 TDI - {{convert|66|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, in-line four-cylinder [[fuel injection#direct injection|direct-injection]] turbodiesel (with [[intercooler]])

All petrol versions could be ordered with [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]]; at the time, however, it could only be combined with a five-speed [[manual transmission]].  Additionally, Audi built about 2500 units of the ''Quattro Competition'' for the German and European market.  It was a street [[homologation]] of the B4-based [[Super Tourenwagen Cup]] (STW) race car saloon with four-wheel drive and a modified 140&nbsp;PS, 16-valve, two-litre petrol engine.  The [[powertrain]] had its roots in the two-litre, four-cylinder [[straight engine|inline engines]] that most European Audi&nbsp;80s were equipped with at the time.  On the outside, the ''Quattro Competition'' featured the same bumpers as the S2, V6 headlights, and a [[spoiler (automotive)|rear wing]] mounted on the bootlid.  Together with the S2 and the RS2 Avant, the ''Quattro Competition'' has become an increasingly rare and highly sought-after collector's item.

Together with the saloon, Audi produced a B4-based estate, the ''Audi 80 Avant'', and a convertible, the '''Audi Cabriolet''', which was largely based on the Coupé, meaning that Audi now had saloon, coupé, cabriolet, and estate variants of the 80 available to European customers.  For the North American market, however, Audi only sold coupés during the 1990 and 1991 [[model year]]s, and the station wagon was never officially available.  The Cabriolet was Audi's first soft-top.  Initially available with the 2.3&nbsp;litre five-cylinder engine, a 2.0&nbsp;litre four-cylinder, and then 2.6&nbsp;litre V6 were offered later.  Heavily engineered to retain the structural strength of the Coupé (with which it shared sports suspension), its screen was reinforced to preclude the need for a [[rollover#roll bars and cages|roll bar]].

As of the 1994 model year, a [[limited edition]] model, known as ''Europa'', was introduced on the European market.  It could be ordered both as a saloon and an Avant.  It was factory-equipped with power mirrors, [[alloy wheel]]s, rear seat headrests, an [[airbag]] steering wheel, and offered a choice between power [[sunroof]] or [[air conditioning]].  It came in five different special colours.  For "regular" 1994 B4 saloons and Avants, standard features as well as options available were stepped up too, including an airbag steering wheel and redesigned door liners (standard), and passenger airbags and a built-in [[immobilizer|engine immobiliser]] (optional).

The B4 saloon was discontinued at the end of the 1994 model year (although a number of European vehicles are known to have been first registered as late as early 1995; in North America, sales continued into 1995 as well).  Avant and Coupé followed suit in 1995/96.  The Cabriolet, however, was carried on until 2000.  As of the 1998 model year, it underwent a few minor yet visible touch-ups in its European version, such as gently redesigned bumpers and instrument clusters, ''projection lens'' [[headlamp|headlights]] and more options available.  In addition to this facelift, a special edition was introduced for the European market under the name ''Sunline''.  Among other specs, it was equipped with all leather interior, air conditioning, 16-inch alloy wheels, a power soft-top and a leather steering wheel.

Both the Coupé and the Cabriolet were effectively replaced by the first-generation [[Audi TT]] coupé and roadster, sold between 1998 and 2006.  The B4 platform saloon was replaced by the [[Audi A4]] for the 1995 [[model year]] (1996 in North America), followed by a new ''A4 Avant'' later in 1996.  A mid-sized convertible was not available again until 2002, when the A4&nbsp;Cabriolet was introduced.  Audi has released a new mid-sized coupé for the 2008 model year, which is now known as the [[Audi A5]].

===Audi RS2 Avant{{anchor|RS2}}===
[[Image:Rs2logo.png|thumb|right|RS2 Logo]]
{{Main|Audi RS2 Avant}}
The '''Audi RS2 Avant''' is fitted with a similar 2.2&nbsp;[[litre]] turbocharged engine to the S2, but producing {{convert|232|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}.  Reaching {{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in just 4.8&nbsp;[[second]]s, it has a top speed of {{convert|262|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.

The Audi RS2 was generally only available as an Avant, although four 4-door saloon models were officially produced by the factory, including one for the chief of the RS2 development programme.  The RS2 was at least partially assembled at Porsche's Rossle-Bau plant in [[Zuffenhausen]].  Prior to manufacturing the RS2, the Porsche Zuffenhausen assembly line was busy producing the high-performance [[W124]] bodystyle [[Mercedes-Benz 500E]].  The RS2/Porsche link is further exemplified by the RS2's dual circuit Porsche braking system (wearing [[Brembo]] calipers with a Porsche name), 7.0Jx17" [[alloy wheel]]s which were identical in design to the [[Porsche 911 Turbo]] wheels of that era, and side view mirrors are also borrowed from the Porsche 911 Turbo.  Additionally, the word "PORSCHE" is inscribed in the RS2 factory emblems affixed to the tailgate and front [[grille]], and on the engine's inlet manifold.  Porsche modified the Avant S2 body optics, added more [[motive power|power]], better [[brake]]s, bigger [[sway bar|anti-roll bars]] to front and rear, fine tuned the interior - and a super-sports estate was born.  Porsche's involvement in the project was on the strict understanding that a coupé model would not be produced, as this was felt to be too close to Porsche's own products.

==''Typ'' codes==
Audi assigned its individual models ''"Typ"'' codes, in addition to the primary [[Volkswagen Group B platform]] codes:
* '''F103''' - Audi 80 (1966–1969)

* '''Typ 85''' - B2; Audi Coupé (1981–1987); Audi 4000 (Canada) (1981-1987) ; [[Audi Quattro]] (1981–1991); Audi 4000 quattro (1984-1987); Audi Sport Quattro (1984–1987)
* '''Typ 89/8A''' - B3; Audi 80/90 (1987–1992)
* '''Typ 89Q''' - B3; Audi 80/90 quattro (1987–1992)
* '''Typ 8B''' - B3; Audi Coupé (1989–1996); Audi S2 (1991–1996)
* '''Typ 8C''' - B4; Audi 80 (1992–1995); Audi RS2 Avant (1994-1996)
* '''Typ 8G''' - B4; Audi Cabriolet (1991–2000)
