==Tiguan HY Motion – Hydrogen Power==
At the 2007 Michelin Challenge Bibendum in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], Volkswagen showed the Tiguan HY MOTION study powered by a [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]].

The [[fuel cell]] produces an output power of 80&nbsp;kW and the [[electric]] motor has 100&nbsp;kW. These figures give the Tiguan HY.MOTION a top speed of 150&nbsp;km/h and an acceleration from 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h in 14 seconds.

The [[lithium-ion battery]] has a charge capacity of 6.8 ampere-hours and is an auxiliary energy storage system.
Power output from the lithium-ion battery is 22&nbsp;kW.

Battery charge is recovered from braking energy or the hydrogen fuel cell.
