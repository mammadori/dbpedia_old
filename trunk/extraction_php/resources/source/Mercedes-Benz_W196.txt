The '''Mercedes-Benz W196''' was the [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Formula One]] entry in the {{f1|1954}} and {{f1|1955}} [[Formula One]] seasons, winning 9 of 12 races entered in the hands of [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] and [[Stirling Moss]].

Remarkable firsts included the use of [[Desmodromic valve]]s and [[fuel injection]] developed by Mercedes engineers through experience gained on the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter engine during World War II.

The legendary [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR]] was derived from the W196 for the [[1955 World Sportscar Championship season]].

==Type Monza==

The W196's delayed debut on the [[1954 French Grand Prix]] circuit saw the introduction of the aerodynamic aluminum "Type Monza" body for the high speed track at [[Reims-Gueux]], Fangio and [[Karl Kling]] claiming a 1-2 finish and youngster [[Hans Herrmann]] posting fastest lap. The same body was later used at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], where it picked up its nickname.

==Open wheel==
Attractive as it was, the streamlined Monza body was not situable for twistier tracks, leading to defeat at its second race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. A conventional open-wheel-version was introduced at the [[Nürburgring]]. Fangio, who had already won the first two GPs of 1954 with a [[Maserati]], won this and the two following GPs, securing his 2nd World Championship.

At the [[1954 Spanish Grand Prix]] in late October the low-mounted Mercedes air-intake clogged with leaves, costing the race and leading to its relocation atop the hood.

In the shortened [[1955 Formula One season]], abbreviated after the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]], the W196 won all but the [[1955 Monaco Grand Prix]], [[Hans Herrmann]] crashing in practice, and the other three team Mercedes cars failing to finish. A highlight for driver Stirling Moss was his finish 0.2 seconds ahead of stable mate Fangio at his home event, the [[1955 British Grand Prix]], his first GP win.

After capturing all three world championships it competed in, Mercedes withdrew from motorsport at the end of the 1955 season. Despite its good track performance, drivers Fangio and Moss described the car in Motor Sport magazine as being "a bit difficult to drive, with a tendency for snap oversteer".

The new 1954 Formula One rules allowed engines of 2.5 litres naturally aspirated or, alternatively, 0.75 litres supercharged. The expected target range for competitive engines was {{convert|250|to|300|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}. 

Mercedes' 1939 2-stage supercharged 1.5 litre 64.0×58.0&nbsp;mm V8 ({{convert|1493|cc|cuin|abbr=on|disp=/}}) gave {{convert|278|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at 8,250&nbsp;rpm with about {{convert|2.7|atm|kPa|abbr=on}} pressure. Halving this would have only produced {{convert|139|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}. 

Studies by Mercedes showed that {{convert|290|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at 10,000&nbsp;rpm could be achieved from 0.75 litres with a supercharger pressure of {{convert|4.4|atm|kPa|abbr=on}}. {{convert|390|shp|kW|abbr=on}} would have been developed with {{convert|100|hp|kW|abbr=on}} being required to drive the supercharger. Fuel consumption would have been 2.3 times higher than a naturally aspirated engine developing the same power. Since 115&nbsp;bhp/l (86&nbsp;kW/l) at 9,000&nbsp;rpm was being developed by naturally aspirated motorcycle racing engines, it was decided that a 2.5 litre engine was the correct choice. This was a significant change of philosophy, since all previous Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix engines since the 1920s had been supercharged.

The {{convert|2496.87|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} straight 8 (76.0×68.8&nbsp;mm) gave {{convert|257|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at the 1954 French GP which was its first race. During 1955, this had increased to {{convert|290|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at 8,500&nbsp;rpm. The {{convert|2981.70|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} sports car (78.0×78.0&nbsp;mm) gave {{convert|310|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at 7,500&nbsp;rpm and was a bored and stroked version of the F1 engine complete with desmodromic valves and fuel injection. Variable length inlet tracts were experimented with and four wheel drive considered. An eventual {{convert|340|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at 10,000&nbsp;rpm was targeted for the 2.5 litre F1 motor.
