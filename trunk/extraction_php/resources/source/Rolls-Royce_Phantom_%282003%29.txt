The '''Rolls-Royce Phantom''' British [[sedan (car)|saloon]] [[automobile]] made by [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars]], in England. It was launched in 2003. The [[Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé]], and the [[Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupé]], both based on the 2003 Phantom, are the most recent additions to the [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] brand.

==Construction==

The Phantom uses a unique chassis platform, body, interior, and retains traditional Rolls-Royce design cues. The body is mostly aluminium.

Final assembly, including all body, paint, wood, and leather work, is completed to each customer's individual specification at the Rolls-Royce plant in [[Goodwood]], [[West Sussex]]. The plant is down the street from the historic [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood Motor Racing Circuit]].

The plant contains the paint shop, body shop, leather shop, woodworking shop, assembly line, and executive offices under one roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rolls-roycemotorcars.com/lo-band/rollsroyce_goodwood.htm |title=Design without compromise &#124; Rolls-Royce Goodwood |publisher=Rolls-Royce Motor Cars |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>  There are only two robots in the factory. The two [[paint robot|robots paint]] the body; the paint is polished by hand after the robots spray each coat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rolls-roycemotorcars.com/lo-band/creation_paint.htm |title=Design without compromise &#124; Creation Paint |publisher=Rolls-Royce Motor Cars |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>  All other work is done by hand, in keeping with the Rolls-Royce tradition.
[[Image:2008-0622-RRPhantomV12.jpg|thumb|left|V12 engine of a 2008 Phantom]]
It has a 6.75&nbsp;litre, 48-valve, [[V12 engine|V12]] engine that produces {{convert|453|bhp|kW PS|abbr=on}} and {{convert|720|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of [[torque]]. The engine is derived from BMW's N73 V12 powerplant. The engine is assembled by BMW. The engine uses direct fuel injection, and is a drive by wire design, using valvetronic technology. The power output is regulated by infinitely varying valve lift by moving the rockers and rocker fulcrums via electric servos, rather than using the throttle body.The throttle body is maintained for fail-safe operation.

The aluminium extrusions that are used to construct the aluminium spaceframe are produced in Norway using hydroelectric power, shaped and machined in Denmark and finally hand-welded in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rolls-roycemotorcars.com/lo-band/rollsroyce_100facts2.htm |title=Design without compromise &#124; Rolls-Royce Facts |publisher=Rolls-Royce Motor Cars |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>

It is 1.63&nbsp;m (63&nbsp;in) tall, 1.99&nbsp;m (74.8&nbsp;in) wide, 5.83&nbsp;m (228&nbsp;in) long, and weighs 2485&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] (5478&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]). The body of the car is built on an [[aluminium]] [[space frame]] and the Phantom can accelerate to 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) in 5.7&nbsp;s. It has a six-speed [[automatic transmission]] and [[double wishbone suspension]]. The transmission is sourced from [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] of Germany. The vehicle electronics are sourced from BMW.

An extended wheelbase Phantom was presented in March 2005 at the [[Salon International de l'Auto|Geneva Motor Show]], which is 250 mm (9.8 in) longer than the standard Phantom. It is currently referred to as the Phantom Extended Wheelbase<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/2005_new_york/0503_rolls_royce_phantom_extended_wheelbase/|title=AutoMobile Mag}}</ref> (or EWB).

==Novel features==
*Customers can choose from 44,000 paint colours, and specify any leather colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rolls-roycemotorcars.com/lo-band/rollsroyce_100facts.htm |title=Design without compromise &#124; Rolls-Royce Facts |publisher=Rolls-Royce Motor Cars |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>

*Instead of a [[tachometer]], the car has a ''power reserve'' dial indicating how much of the engine's power is left available to the driver. This is to provide a sense of tremendous power in reserve, and to hide "crude" underlying mechanicals from its owners. The cluster is not shared with any other vehicle. Doors are remote operated.

*The rear doors are rear-hinged, a style commonly referred to as ''[[suicide door]]s'', but called 'coach doors' by Rolls-Royce. Because of the rear-seating position in relation to the rear inner-door handles, buttons are mounted on both C-pillars which operate hydraulic motors in order to close the rear doors. An electronic lock prevents the doors from being accidentally opened when moving. The car will automatically brake to a walking speed if a coach door remains open when driving off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rolls-roycemotorcars.com/lo-band/rollsroyce_100facts4.htm |title=Design without compromise &#124; Rolls-Royce Facts |publisher=Rolls-Royce Motor Cars |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref> The rear doors also house [[umbrella]]s that are stored within the doors, and can only be accessed when the front or rear doors are open. The fabric of the umbrella is coated with [[Teflon]] to assist in shedding water when the wet umbrella is stored within the door.

*The traditional [[Spirit of Ecstasy]] ornament has an automatic electronic retraction mechanism to prevent theft and protect pedestrians in the event of an accident. It may also be retracted by the driver at the touch of a button, and retracted when the alarm is armed. The base contains a sensor which detects movement, and will retract if tampered with.

*The 'RR' logos on each of the wheel hubs are independent [[bezel]]s in order to always remain upright while the wheel is rotating.

==Luxury Amenities==
Features include a navigation system with voice recognition, power sunroof, upgraded leather upholstery, rear-view camera, rear-seat DVD entertainment system, 26-speaker premium sound system, 8-disc CD changer, 18-way power front seats, 16-way power rear seats, heated and cooled cup holders, rear-seat tables, outside-temperature indicator, universal garage door opener, power tilt/telescopic heated wood and leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio, climate, and navigation controls, power open/close trunk lid, power closing doors, wireless headphones, iPod adapter, refrigerator, and air conditioning with 5-zone climate controls.

{{main|Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé}}
[[Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé]] is the latest convertible made by Rolls-Royce which debuted at the 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] on 7 January 2007. The platform is based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom and has styling heavily derived from the 100EX concept car unveiled to celebrate the company's centennial in 2005.
