The '''Opel Olympia''' is a [[small family car]] produced by the German automaker [[Opel]] from 1935 to 1940, from 1947 to 1953 and again from 1967 to 1970.

The car was first presented in February at the 1935 Berlin Motor Show: production got under way later during that year.   The Olympia was named in anticipation of the 1936 [[Berlin Olympic Games]].    Before [[World War II]] it was made in two versions. From 1935 to 1937 the Olympia had a 1.3&nbsp;litre engine. For the OL38 version made from 1937 to 1940 this was replaced by a 1.5&nbsp;litre overhead valve unit.

The 1935 Olympia was Germany's first mass-produced car with an all-steel unitized body ([[monocoque]])<ref>GM Media Online, http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/company/c_history/1930/index.html</ref>. This revolutionary technology reduced the weight of the car by 180 kilograms (400 lb.) compared to its predecessor<ref>Bartels, E.; Manthey, R. (2004). ''Opel Jahrbuch 2005'', Brilon: Podszun (ISBN 3-86133-366-X), 37</ref>. Production of the unibody design required new production methods and materials. Spot welding, advanced types of steel, and a new production line layout were among the many advances introduced by the Olympia<ref>Bartels, E.; Manthey, R. (2004). ''Opel Jahrbuch 2005'', Brilon: Podszun (ISBN 3-86133-366-X), 35 ff.</ref>.

Between 1935 and the 1940 over 168.000 units were built.

The name Olympia was revived in 1967 for a luxury version of the Opel Kadett B.

At 2500 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] it offered a true four-seater with 1.3&nbsp;litre, 4 cylinder, [[side valve]], 24&nbsp;hp (18&nbsp;kW) engine capable of 95&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph). Drive was to the rear wheels through a three speed gearbox but a four speed unit became available in 1937. The car had independent front suspension with a live axle at the rear and semi-elliptic leaf springs.

The car was made available in two versions, as a two door saloon and as a two-door soft-top convertible:
* LZ 2-door 4-light saloon, costing 2500 Reichsmark
* CL 2-door 4-light cabriolet

A new engine was introduced in 1937 with a capacity of 1488&nbsp;cc and overhead valves. It produced 37&nbsp;hp (27&nbsp;kW) and the top speed of the car was 112&nbsp;km/h (70&nbsp;mph). The car's body received a facelift.

It was available in the same versions as its predecessor with the addition of the 6-light LV:
* LZ 2-door 4-light saloon, 2675 Reichsmark 
* LV 4-door 6-light saloon, 2950 Reichsmark
* CL 2-door 4-light cabriolet, 2750 Reichsmark

Due to World War II, production came to a halt in late 1940. During the war, the Opel plant in [[Rüsselsheim]] was severely damaged by allied bomb attacks. After reconstruction, production of the Olympia restarted in late 1947. The OL 38 was unchanged to the pre-war car but only the two door sedan was produced. Until the end of 1949, 25.952 of them were made.

In January 1950, the Olympia got a modernized body. But the car was still based on the pre-war Olympia. The following bodies were offered:
* 2-door saloon, 6400 Deutsche Mark
* 2-door convertible, 6600 Deutsche Mark
* 2-door estate, 7350 Deutsche Mark

In three years of production, about 160.000 cars were made.

==First successors: Opel Olympia Rekord (1953–57), later Opel Rekord (1957–86)==
In March 1953, the 18 year old design of the Olympia was finally replaced by a completely new car. It was called '''Opel Olympia Rekord''' and it had a modern pontoon body. For this car and its successors, see [[Opel Rekord]].

==Name revival: Opel Olympia A (1967–70)==
[[Image:Opel Olympia A 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Opel Olympia A]]
The Olympia name was revived in 1967. This time it was only a luxury version of the contemporary [[Opel Kadett|Opel Kadett B]]. Engines were a 1100&nbsp;cc unit with 60&nbsp;hp (44&nbsp;kW) taken from the Kadett and two larger units, a 1700&nbsp;cc with 75&nbsp;hp (55&nbsp;KW) and a 1900&nbsp;cc with 90&nbsp;hp (66&nbsp;kW) which were normally used in the [[Opel Rekord]].

Body styles were:
* 2-door saloon
* 4-door saloon
* 2-door coupé 

The Olympia A was not highly successful, and was replaced in 1970 by the all new [[Opel Ascona]].
