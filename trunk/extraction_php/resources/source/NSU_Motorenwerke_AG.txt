'''NSU Motorenwerke [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]''', (normally just '''NSU'''), was a [[Germany|German]] manufacturer of [[automobile|cars]] and [[motorcycle]]s, which was founded in 1873.  It was acquired by [[Volkswagen Group]] in 1969.  VW merged the company with [[Auto Union]], to eventually evolve into [[Audi]] as it is known today.

NSU began as a [[knitting machine]] manufacturer in the town of [[Riedlingen]] on the [[Danube]] in 1873, and moved to  [[Neckarsulm]], where the river [[Sulm (German river)|Sulm]] flows into the river [[Neckar]], in 1884.  The company soon began to produce [[bicycle]]s as well, and by 1892, bicycle manufacturing had completely replaced the knitting machine production.  At about this time, the name NSU (from Neckar and Sulm) appeared as brand name.

The first NSU motorcycle appeared in 1901,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/1956-nsu-supermax.aspx|title=1956 NSU Supermax|publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=2009-08-24|date=Premier Issue|author=Ric Anderson}}</ref> followed by the first NSU car in 1905.  In 1932 the car production in Heilbronn was sold to [[Fiat]].

During [[World War II]] NSU designed and produced the famous [[Kettenkrad]], the NSU HK101, a [[half-track]]ed motorcycle with the engine of the [[Opel]] Olympia.

After the war, NSU restarted in a completely destroyed plant with pre-war constructions like the Quick, OSL and Konsul motorbikes; furthermore, the HK101 continued to be sold by NSU as an all-terrain vehicle in a civil version.  The first post-war construction was the NSU Fox in 1949, available in a 2-stroke and a 4-stroke version.  In 1953 the famous NSU Max followed, a 250 cc motorbike with a unique overhead camdrive with connecting rods.  All these new models had a very innovative monocoque frame of pressed steel and a central rear suspension unit.  [[Albert Roder]], the genius chief engineer behind the success story, made it possible that in 1955 NSU became the biggest [[motorcycle]] producer in the world.  NSU also holds 4 world records for speed: 1951, 1953, 1954 and 1955.  In 1956 Wilhelm Herz started at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], Utah. Herz was the first man to ride a motorcycle faster than 200 miles per hour, in August 1956.

In 1957 NSU re-entered the car market with the new [[NSU Prinz]], a small car with a doubled NSU Max engine, an [[aircooling|air cooled]] two-cylinder engine of 600 cc and 20 hp.  Motorbike production continued until 1968.  NSU's last production motorcycle was the [[NSU Quick 50|Quick 50]].<ref name=SparesGallery>[http://www.nsuquicklyspares.co.uk/gallery.html NSU Quickly Spares Gallery]</ref><ref name=FredyQ50>[http://www.nsu-cars.ch/Quick50.htm Fredy's NSU Page:Quick 50]</ref>

In 1964 NSU offered the first [[Wankel]] engine car of the world: the NSU Wankelspider.  In the same year Prinz 1000 and derivates like the TT and TT/S followed.  As a family car the Typ 110 (later 1200SC called) was launched in 1965 with a more spacious body design.  The last NSU cars with a conventional four-stroke engine had the air cooled [[OHC]] four cylinder engine in common.

In 1967 the sensational 2 rotor, 115 hp [[NSU Ro 80]] was presented to public and soon gained several design awards like "car of the year 1967".  Despite its public acclaim, sales of the Ro 80 were disappointing.

===Volkswagen Group takeover===
The development of the [[Wankel engine|rotary engine]] was very cost-intensive for the small company.  Problems with the tip seals of the engine rotor significantly damaged the brand's reputation amongst consumers.  In 1969, the company was taken over by [[Volkswagen Group]], who merged NSU with [[Auto Union]].  The new, merged, company was called ''[[Audi]] NSU [[Auto-Union]] A.G'' and represented the effective end of both the NSU and DKW marques with all future production to bear the Audi badge (although retaining the four interlocking circles of Auto Union). The management of the Neckarsulm plant moved to Audi's headquarters in [[Ingolstadt]].  Since the small rear engined NSU models (Prinz 4, 1000, 1200) phased out in 1973, the Ro 80 was the last car still in production carrying the NSU badge. [[Audi]] never made use of the brand name NSU again after April 1977, when the last [[NSU Ro 80]] was sold.

Even as production of the Ro 80 continued in the Neckarsulm plant, production of larger Audi models like [[Audi 100]] and [[Audi 200]] was started.  The [[Porsche 924]] and later [[Porsche 944]] were also assembled in the Neckarsulm plant.  Those models were joint venture projects of [[Porsche]] and [[VW]], but Porsche did not have the internal capacity to build the 924 and 944.  In the present day, Neckarsulm is the production plant for Audi's topline vehicles like [[Audi A6]], [[Audi A8]] and [[Audi R8]].  Furthermore, it is the home of the "Aluminium- und Leichtbauzentrum" where Audi's aluminium-made space frame bodies are designed and engineered.

NSU is primarily remembered today as the first licensee and one of only three automobile companies to produce cars for sale with rotary [[Wankel engine]]s.  NSU invented the principle of the modern Wankel engine with an inner rotor.  The [[NSU Ro 80]] was the second mass-produced two-rotor Wankel-powered vehicle after the [[Mazda Cosmo]].  In 1967, NSU and [[Citroën]] set up a common company, [[Comotor]], to build engines for [[Citroën]] and other car makers. Only [[Mazda]] continued developing the Wankel engine.  Mazda currently has a reliable sportscar, the RX-8, in its portfolio looking back on a successful [[Mazda Wankel engine|Wankel engine family]].

A museum in Neckarsulm, the [[:de:Deutsches Zweirad- und NSU-Museum|Deutsches Zweirad- und NSU-Museum]], has many of NSU's products on display.
