'''Volkswagen Type 18A''' was a special version made for the German police that started production in 1949.  In German it was called "Polizei Cabriolet".  In total 482 cars were made.  The lack of doors made it easy to get in or out of the car, but made it uncomfortable during the winter.  Due to the design the floorpan was strengthened.  The engine was a stock VW Beetle engine producing {{Convert|25|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and giving a top speed of {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

The car was initially made by [[Hebmüller]], but in 1950 the production was moved to [[Karmann]].  Later a version with doors ([[Volkswagen 15A|15A]] M47) was also produced.  During the late 1940s, four different types of "Polizei Cabriolets" were made by Karmann, Hebmüller, [[Papler]] and the Austrian [[Austro-Tatra]].
