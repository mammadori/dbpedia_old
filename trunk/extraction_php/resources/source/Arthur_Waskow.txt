'''Arthur Ocean Waskow''', born Arthur I. Waskow, (born 1933 in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]) is an [[United States|American]] author, political activist, and [[rabbi]] associated with the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement.

==Education and early career==
Waskow received a bachelor's degree from [[The Johns Hopkins University]] in 1954 and a Ph.D. in [[History of the United States|American history]] from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. He worked from 1959 to 1961 as legislative assistant to [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Robert Kastenmeier]] of [[Wisconsin]]. He was a Senior Fellow at the [[Peace Research Institute]] from 1961 through 1963. He joined [[Richard Barnet]] and [[Marcus Raskin]] and helped to found the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] in 1963, and he served as Resident Fellow until 1977.<ref name="Bio">[http://www.theshalomcenter.org/node/1008 Arthur Waskow: Full Biography and Selected Bibliography]</ref>

In 1968 Waskow was elected an alternate delegate from the [[District of Columbia]] to the [[1968 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]]. His delegation was pledged to support [[Robert Kennedy]], and after Kennedy's assassination Waskow proposed and the delegation agreed to nominate Reverend [[Channing Phillips]], chair of the delegation, for President — the first [[African American|Black person]] so nominated at a major party convention.

Waskow was a contributing editor to the [[New Left|leftist]] ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine, which published his "Freedom [[Passover Seder|Seder]]" in 1969. The "Freedom Seder" was the first widely published [[Passover]] [[Haggadah of Pesach|Haggadah]] that intertwined the archetypal [[The Exodus|liberation]] of the [[Israelite]]s from [[slavery]] in [[Ancient Egypt]] with more modern liberation struggles such as the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] and the [[women's movement]].<ref name="Bio"/>

Through the 1960s, Waskow was active in writing, speaking, [[Election|electoral politics]], and [[Nonviolence|nonviolent action]] against the [[Vietnam War]]. Since 1963, he participated in [[sit-in]]s and [[teach-in]]s, and was arrested many times for [[protest]]s against [[racial segregation]], [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|the Vietnam War]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|oppression of Jews]], [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]], and [[Opposition to the Iraq War|the Iraq war]].<ref name="Bio"/>

==Religious initiatives==
Since 1969, Waskow has taken a leadership role in the Jewish Renewal movement. He founded [[Shalom Center|The Shalom Center]] in 1983 and serves as its director. In its inception the Shalom Center primarily confronted the threat of nuclear war from a Jewish perspective, emphasizing the story of Noah and the imperative to save the world from "a flood of fire". As the Cold War abated, the Shalom Center turned its focus toward ecology and human rights issues. The chief concerns of The Shalom Center are:

* The [[Iraq War]] and related issues, including the growing use of [[torture]] by the United States and [[Unitary executive theory|unchecked presidential power]];
* [[U.S. Oil politics|American addiction to over-use of oil]] and the danger it poses to the planet through [[global warming]];
* The creation of deeper connections among [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Muslim]]s; 
* An [[interfaith]] effort to identify and encourage the use and marketing of "[[Kashrut#Ethical Eating|Sacred Foods]]";
* Peace in the [[Middle East]];
* [[LGBT social movements|Lesbian and gay rights]], especially in [[Same-sex marriage|marriage]] and other sacred contexts;
* The rights of [[United States immigration debate|immigrants]].<ref name="Shalom">[http://www.theshalomcenter.org/node/1196 The Shalom Center: A Brief History, 1983 to 2008]</ref>

From 1982 to 1989, Waskow was a member of the faculty of the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]], where he taught courses on contemporary theology and practical rabbinics. He has also taught in the religion departments of [[Swarthmore College]], [[Temple University]], [[Drew University]], and [[Vassar College]].<ref name="Bio"/>

In 1993, Waskow co-founded [[ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal]]. Between 1993 and 2005, he performed research, wrote, and spoke on behalf of ALEPH.<ref name="Bio"/>

Waskow was [[Semicha|ordained a rabbi]] in 1995 by a [[beth din]] (rabbinical court) made up of a rabbi with [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] lineage, a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] rabbi, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbi, and a [[Religious feminism|feminist theologian]].<ref name="Bio"/>

Waskow's best-known books include ''Godwrestling'' (1978), ''Seasons of Our Joy'' (1982), ''Down-to-Earth Judaism: Food, Money, Sex, and the Rest of Life'' (1995), and ''Godwrestling — Round 2: Ancient Wisdom, Future Paths'' (1996).

== Views and public honors==

Some of Waskow's positions on religious and political issues, and his interpretations of Jewish traditions, have drawn criticism from more conservative quarters of the Jewish community and from some parts of the American Left.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Pointing to the implications of the [[Jubilee year]] for the peaceful and meditative redistribution of land, Waskow has argued that prophetic Judaism contains elements of social vision that have reappeared in some aspects of [[Marxism]] and some aspects of [[Buddhism]]<ref>[http://www.mljewish.org/cgi-bin/retrieve.cgi?VOLUME=8&NUMBER=39&FORMAT=html Mail.Liberal-Judaism Volume 8 Number 39<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

Waskow has been a strong critic of [[Israel]]i policies in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. He is opposed to the [[Second Iraq War]], citing what he describes as  Jewish religious grounds. He has supported the positions of [[Cindy Sheehan]]. Waskow has said he has found no evidence of Sheehan making anti-Israel statements attributed to her <ref>http://www.knoxstudio.com/shns/story.cfm?pk=SHEEHAN-08-24-05&cat=AN</ref>.

Waskow has supported full rights and full presence of gay and lesbian persons in the Jewish community and in American life, including supporting the right to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex]] Jewish and civil marriage.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Since his first visit to Israel (and at the same time to the West Bank, Gaza, and [[East Jerusalem]]) in 1969, he has supported a [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], and has strongly condemned such actions by some [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] as [[Palestinian political violence|terrorist attacks on Israel]] and such acts of the Israeli government as the invasions of [[Lebanon]] in [[1982 Lebanon War|1982]] and [[2006 Lebanon War|2006]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}}  He became one of the founding members of [[Rabbis for Human Rights]]/North America and served on its board and steering committee. When some parts of the US antiwar movement demonized Israel, he publicly criticized their behavior and The Shalom Center sponsored alternative actions that strongly criticized the Iraq war while affirming the legitimacy of Israel and the importance of its achieving peace with a [[Palestinian state]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Though a critic of the environmental policies of [[Venezuela]]n president [[Hugo Chávez]], Waskow has disagreed with claims that Chávez is anti-Semitic, pointing out that his critical comments on ". . .some minorities, descendants of those who crucified Christ, descendants of those who threw Bolívar out of here . . .took the world's riches for themselves. . ." were referring not to the Jews but to the heirs of the Roman Empire that crucified Jesus and of the Spanish empire that attacked Bolivar  -- that is, to the US empire of today <ref>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/w-sa/2006/jan/05/010508277.html]</ref>.

In 1996, Waskow was named by the United Nations  a “Wisdom Keeper” among forty religious and intellectual leaders who met in connection with the Habitat II conference in Istanbul. He was presented the [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] Award by the Jewish Peace Fellowship and in 2005 was named by the Forward newspaper one of the "Forward Fifty" leaders of American Jewry. In 2007, ''[[Newsweek]]'' named him one of the fifty most influential American rabbis.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17721005/site/newsweek/ The Top 50 Rabbis in America], ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[April 2]], [[2007]].</ref> In that year also, the [http://www.nim-phila.org/ Neighborhood Interfaith Movement of Philadelphia] presented him its Rev. Richard Fernandez Religious Leadership Award, and the [http://www.masnet.org/freedomfoundation.asp Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation] presented him its Peace and Justice Award.

Waskow has taught as a Visiting Professor in the religion departments of Swarthmore College (1982-83, on the thought of [[Martin Buber]] and on the [[Book of Genesis]] and its rabbinic and modern interpretations); Temple University (1975-76 on contemporary Jewish theology and 1985-86, on liberation theologies in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam); Drew University (1997-1998, on the ecological outlooks of ancient, rabbinic, and contemporary Judaism and on the synthesis of mysticism, feminism, and social action in the theology and practice of Jewish renewal); Vassar College (1999 on Jewish Renewal and Feminist Judaism); and from 1982 to 1989 on the faculty of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (contemporary theology and practical rabbinics).
