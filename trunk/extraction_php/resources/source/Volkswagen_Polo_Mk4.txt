The '''Volkswagen Polo Mk4''' is the fourth generation of the [[Volkswagen Polo]] [[supermini car|supermini]], produced by the German automaker [[Volkswagen]] since late 2001.

==History==
Launched in September 2001, the fourth generation Polo (internal designation ''Typ'' 9N) was made available in early 2002.  In keeping with VW's aim of floor pan sharing it shares its platform with the [[SEAT Ibiza]] Mk3, [[SEAT Córdoba]] Mk2 and [[Škoda Fabia]] Mk1 & Mk2 .  The car is all new, and bears more structural resemblance to the 6K than the 6N, outwardly the most recognizable change is the quad round headlights similar to the [[Volkswagen Lupo]].  At a length of {{convert|3900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, it is larger than the first generation of its larger sibling, the {{convert|3820|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1]].

The car was available with several petrol and diesel engines: a 1.2&nbsp;L [[Straight-3|three-cylinder]] [[petrol engine]] with {{convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|64|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}  (depending on the number of valves per cylinder, two or four) and a 16-valve 1.4&nbsp;L [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] with {{convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} petrol engine, the last one on the 16V-badged model.  Both turbocharged and unturbocharged diesel engines were available such as the 4 cylinder 1.9L SDI ([[Suction Diesel Injection]]) which also offered {{convert|64|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} but  with {{convert|125|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of torque, slightly more than some petrol powered units. As well as the unturbocharged SDI engine, newer [[TDI]] PD [[turbodiesel]] units were also available, these being a 1.9&nbsp;L with {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and a three-cylinder 1.4&nbsp;L model (the 1.9 with one cylinder less) with {{convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.  A sporty 1.9 TDI PD model, named Polo GT, was launched in 2004, with {{convert|130|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.

Sales in the UK were disappointing, and in 2005 it finished in the bottom 10 of the Top Gear survey - in the supermini sector, only the [[Fiat Punto]] was more disappointing to own.

Volkswagen Racing part of VW Motorsport rallied a Polo S1600 in the 2003 [[Junior World Rally  Championship|JWRC]] winning the [[Rally of Turkey|Turkish]] round, the Super 1600 developed {{convert|165|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}}  to its front wheels.

===Release in North America===
[[File:Volkswagen Polo Diesel 3-Door (MIAS).JPG|thumb|right|Volkswagen Polo clean diesel]]
In January 2009, [[Volkswagen Group of America]] CEO Stefan Jacoby announced that the Polo will finally reach North America to join the vehicle lineup as a true entry-level car below the Rabbit. Volkswagen fans in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] have been clamoring for the Polo to be added to the North American VW lineup for years. It is uncertain whether North America will receive the previous generation Polo or the current generation version, which is set to debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2009. It is anticipated that the Polo will be built at Volkswagen's plant in [[Puebla, Mexico]] to help keep the price of the vehicle low.<ref>http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/16/confirmed-vw-polo-coming-to-the-u-s/ CONFIRMED: VW Polo coming to the U.S., Retrieved 1-Feb-09</ref>

==Models and specifications==
The model range includes the norm for current VW's from the Comfortline to the Trendline and Highline, whilst featuring an extense list of extras that had now become norm in mid-sized small cars.  Items such as ABS, power steering, front and side air bags and front and rear head restraints were standard on all models and ESP, brake assistance, air conditioning, satellite navigation etc. were optional on higher spec models.

There was also a [[mini SUV]] version of the Polo with off-road styling named Polo Fun (Polo Dune in the UK), but despite its appearance the car was never available with [[four-wheel drive]]. Volkswagen has revealed that the Mk5 Polo Fun/Polo Dune/CrossPolo will have 4MOTION.<ref>[http://paultan.org/archives/2008/06/29/next-generation-crosspolo-to-get-4motion/ Next generation CrossPolo to get 4MOTION]</ref> A [[sedan (car)|sedan]] version, called Polo Classic, is produced in [[Brazil]], [[South Africa]] and [[China]] and exported to the rest of [[Latin America]].  The Chinese version has the distinction of being the first Chinese-built car to be produced in [[right hand drive]].

===2005 facelift (''Typ'' 9N3){{anchors|Mk4F|9N3}}===
In 2005, the ''Typ'' 9N was facelifted to create the '''Mk4F''', with new headlights, taillights and a different hatch, which resemble other recent models in Volkswagen's lineup.  The ''Typ'' 9N3 was designed by [[Walter de'Silva]] and comes in six different trims, ranging from the basic 'E' model to the 'GTI'.  Like its predecessor, the standard models uses the same engine range from the 1.2&nbsp;L 55&nbsp;PS (40&nbsp;kW) 3-cylinder engine to the {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} TDI engine.

Volkswagen also announced the successor of the Polo Fun [[mini MPV]], now called "CrossPolo", still missing four-wheel drive.

===Polo GTI===
{{main article|Volkswagen Polo GTI}}
With the introduction of the Polo Mk4, the Polo GTI Mk3 was discontinued and was given no direct replacement.  It was not until late 2005 that the Polo GTI was reintroduced.  It was unveiled on [[October 21]], [[2005]] at the [[Australian International Motor Show]].  It featured a 20-valve turbocharged 1.8-litre {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}  petrol engine which had been used in models such as the Golf GTI Mk4 and the [[VW Passat]] Mk5.

Its styling bears some resemblance to the Mk5 Golf GTI, with a blacked out central "scoop" in the bumper surrounding the honeycomb grille.  In this new model the xenon headlights and fully digital climate control are options, unlike the Polo GTI Mk3 which feaured them as standard.  Although faster than the previous model, the Polo GTI Mk4 is less powerful than the top versions of the [[Renault Clio]], [[BMW MINI]] and its stablemate [[SEAT Ibiza]], most of which come with engines with a maximum output above  {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. This led Volkswagen to quickly beef up the Polo further to create the Polo GTI Cup Edition, which was tuned to around {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and featured more aggressive styling.

===Other versions===
In 2006, VW released the Polo [[BlueMotion]] which has a fuel consumption of {{convert|3.9|L/100 km|abbr=on}} and the Polo GTI Cup Edition with {{convert|132|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} , which sprinted to 0-100&nbsp;km (0-62&nbsp;mph) in 7.5 seconds.

VW Racing in South Africa rallied a [[Super 2000]] Polo, which shared some components with its sister [[World Rally Car]] [[Škoda Fabia]].  Its 2.0-litre engine delivered a maximum output of {{convert|191|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} .
