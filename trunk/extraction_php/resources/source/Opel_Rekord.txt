The '''Opel Rekord''' was a [[family car]] which was built in several generations by the [[Germany|German]] [[automaker|car manufacturer]] [[Opel]], from 1929 to 2009 a subsidiary of [[General Motors]].

===Naming===
The Rekord name evolved into the main name of the model; at first the name was used in close relationship with the [[Opel Olympia]] name, which pre-dated the Rekord but was also re-instated in a separate model in 1967.

The various generations are described here with the manufacturer's, or other commonly used designations such as "Rekord P I" or "Rekord B". The car was not marketed with these additional appellations.

==Opel Olympia Rekord (1953&ndash;57)==
[[Image:Opelrekord.jpg|thumb||1955 Opel Rekord Cabriocoach]]
[[Image:Opel Olympia Rekord.jpg|thumb|Opel Olympia Rekord (1957 model)]]
The '''Opel Olympia Rekord''' was introduced in March 1953 as successor to the Opel Olympia, a pre-[[World War II]] design dating back to 1935. The Opel Olympia Rekord was built until 1957 in four different versions. Around 580,000 units were produced. 

*1953/54: 1488 cc, 40 hp ([[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]]). Available as two-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]], [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] and [[station wagon|estate]] ''(Caravan)''. Price in Germany: DM 6,410 to 6,710. 136,028 units made.

[[Image:1958opelrekord.jpg|thumb|1958 Opel Rekord]]
[[Image:Opel Olympia Caravan.jpg|thumb|Opel Olympia Caravan]]
The Opel Rekord P I had a slightly larger, more modern body with wraparound windscreen and rear screen, introducing to Germany the latest [[USA|American]] fashion of two-tone paintwork.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197724>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ferdinand Simoneit (Ed_| title = Modellchronik des Opel Rekord von 1953 bis 1960| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 24 1977| pages = Seite 58 |date = date 23 November 1977}}</ref>   

The standard model was sold as the Opel Olympia Rekord, while a reduced specification version was marketed simply as the Opel Olympia and widely known, less formally, as the "Bauern-Buick" ''(Peasant's Buick)''.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197724/>   

A new base version with an 1196 cc engine appeared in 1959 badged more simply as the Opel 1200, and replacing the Opel Olympia.

A semi-automatic gearbox ("Olymat") became available for model year 1959.  Initially the car retained the 1488 cc, 45 hp (DIN) of its predecessor: this was complemented by a 1680 cc, 55 hp (DIN);L engine<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197724/> for model year 1960. 

The PI remained in production until 1960. 

* 1958&ndash;59: 1488&nbsp;cc, 45&nbsp;hp (DIN). Available as two-door "Olympia" base model or more luxurious two-door "Olympia Rekord" and as three-door estate ("Caravan") and "delivery" van based on the saloon. Price in Germany: DM 5,785 to 6,845. 509,110 units were made. 

* 1959: 1488&nbsp;cc, 45&nbsp;hp (DIN); on request 1680&nbsp;cc, 55&nbsp;hp (DIN). Also available as four-door saloon. Several refinements including padded dashboard, ignition lock, electrically driven windscreen wipers.  The new base model "Opel 1200" replaced the former [[Opel Olympia|Olympia]] (1196&nbsp;cc, 40&nbsp;hp (DIN), DM 5,835); the 1200 remained in production until December 1962, while the P I was superseded in August 1960 by the Rekord P II. 

Price in Germany: DM 6,545 to 7,110. 307,000 units (P I) + 67.952 units (1200).  In 1959&ndash;60, [[Autenrieth]] of [[Darmstadt]], Germany converted P I two-door sedans to [[coupé]]s and cabriolets, in very limited numbers. Prices were DM 9,380 for the coupé and DM 11,180 for the convertible.

==Opel Rekord P II (1960–63)==
[[Image:Opel rekord p2 v sst.JPG|thumb|Opel Rekord P2 two-door saloon]]
[[Image:Opel Rekord P2.JPG|thumb|Opel Rekord P2 four-door saloon]]
The Rekord P II grew in size, if not in wheelbase, and received a totally new body that did away with wraparound windows.  It was available in several body versions: 2-door and 4-door saloon, a 3-door estate ("Caravan") plus delivery van, a [[pickup truck|pick-up]], and a convertible.  From August 1961 on, a works coupé became available, and in June 1962 a more luxurious "L" version was added with a new top engine of 1700&nbsp;cc "S" and a higher compression ratio. The latest versions had an optional four-speed gearbox. 

Prices in Germany: DM 6,545 to 7,770. 787,684 units made. Autenrieth continued to sell a handful of convertibles at DM 11,635.

==Opel Rekord A (1963&ndash;65)==
[[Image:Opel rekord a v sst.jpg|thumb||Opel Rekord A]]
[[Image:Opel Rekord Caravan 2.JPG|thumb|Opel Rekord A Caravan]]
The Rekord A line-up was a repeat of the Rekord P II (two- and four-door saloon, two-door estate and delivery van, two-door coupé with 1500 or 1700 or 1700 S engines), but the bodies were completely new and the wheelbase stretched to {{convert|103.3|in|mm}}.  March 1964 saw the introduction of the Rekord L-6 with the Opel Kapitän's 2.6&nbsp;litre inline-six. 

Prices in Germany: DM 6.830 to 9.370; front disc brakes: + DM 200, four-speed with floor shift: + DM 180. 885,292 units.  In very limited numbers, [[Karl Deutsch]] of [[Cologne]] sold a convertible version with either 1700 S or 2600 engine at DM 11,765 and 13,060 respectively.

==Opel Rekord B (1966&ndash;67)==
[[Image:Opel rekord b v sst.jpg|thumb||Opel Rekord B]]
While the Rekord B consisted of only a mild facelift compared to the A, it received Opel's new, more oversquare four cylinder CIH (cam in head) engines (1500, 1700 S, 1900 S). The CIH engines were used in all subsequent Rekord generations until 1986, when Rekord was replaced by the [[Opel Omega]]. The 2600 cc six-cylinder engine remained unchanged. The line-up was identical to the Rekord A. 

Prices in Germany: DM 6,980 to 9,570; power brakes: + DM 95, automatic gearbox: + 950, four speed gearbox: + 95. 296,771 units.

[[Image:Opel Rekord 3.jpg|thumb||Opel Rekord C 1.7 S 4-door saloon (1968), two colour version]]
[[Image:Opel Rekord C Cabrio.jpg|thumb|Opel Rekord C Cabriolet]]
With 1,276,681 units built, the Rekord C was the most successful Rekord so far.  The car proved to be a solid hit with the public: it was reliable, roomy and pleasant to look at with its [[Coke bottle styling|coke-bottle line]].

The range consisted of the two- and four-door saloon, two- and (new) four-door estate, delivery van, and two-door hardtop coupé with 1500, 1700, 1700 S, 1900 S fours or (until 1968) a 2200 six.  Very short-lived (1967 only) was a special taxi version on a longer wheelbase (113 inch) with division, that sold for DM 9,950; with it, Opel tried to get a foothold in the German taxi market, then (as now) dominated by [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Again, Karl Deutsch of Cologne offered a convertible version in limited numbers.

There existed several variations of the Rekord C, as well as version made under different names in different countries.

A variation on the Rekord C was the [[Rekord Sprint]] coupé (1967&ndash;71) with driving lights, sport steel wheels, sport stripes and a sporty interior; the Sprint received exclusively the so-called 1900 H engine with two double-barrel carburettors, good for 106&nbsp;hp (DIN) and {{convert|108|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

The former Rekord L-6 was replaced by the new [[Opel Commodore|Commodore]] A, a slightly disguised and better-equipped Rekord C available as two- and four-door sedan and hardtop coupé with six cylinder engines only. 

It was during the life of this model (in fact 1967&ndash;70) that the [[Opel Olympia]] name was revived, but in a separate, smaller car which was based on the period [[Opel Kadett]].

===Ranger===
The Ranger was a Rekord-based range built at the GM Continental plant in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], for the overall [[Europe]]an market, and at [[Port Elizabeth]], [[South Africa]]. 

Styling was similar to the Rekord, although the Ranger had a 4-headlamp grille setup, similar to the [[Vauxhall Victor]] FD range of the time. Initially, there were two models: '''Ranger 130''' and '''Ranger 153'''. In 1970 additional models were announced, being the '''Ranger 1900''' and '''Ranger 2500''', and a "SS" variant, based on the '''Ranger 153'''.

===Other markets===
The Rekord C was also built as the [[Chevrolet]] [[ Chevrolet Opala|Opala]] and Comodoro in [[Brazil]] from 1968 on, available in saloon, coupé and estate forms and featuring either Chevrolet's 2.5&nbsp;L four or 4.1&nbsp;L inline-six. These models received several facelifts and remained in production until about 1992.

A Rekord C coupé was locally-built in [[South Africa]] as a Chevrolet SS during the 1970s<ref name = "SS">Chevrolet SS - a History</ref>.

Prices in Germany (1966): DM 7,630 to 9,560; Sprint (1967): DM 9,775.

[[Image:Opel rekord d v sst.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Rekord D]]
[[Image:Opel Rekord D Break in Cambridge.jpg|thumb|Opel Rekord D Caravan]]
About 1.1 million '''Rekord D'''s were made. Because the name ''Rekord D'' was easily mistaken to connote a diesel-powered car, the name '''Rekord II''' was often used in sales literature. The first prototype was ready in 1971.  The engine types available were 1897 cc, 1698 cc and 2068 cc CIH (cam-in-head) four-cylinder gasoline engines. There was also a diesel version with an engine whose displacement was initially 2.1 litres and afterwards reduced to 2.0 litres. The diesel engine was higher than gasoline variants, so diesel model hoods have a raised mid-section. The six-cylinder variant of this car is called the Commodore B. Transmissions available were standard four-speed manual with either floor or steering-column shifter and TH-180 automatic transmission. The body is of unitary construction. Body types available were four-door saloon, four-door estate and two-door coupé. There was also a variant called "Berlina" with more luxurious interior and wheels.

The '''Rangers''' were also transferred to this new generation, with the dropping of the 130 and 153 and the adding of a 1.7&nbsp;L engine.  In 1972, the line-up consisted of the base '''Ranger 1700''', the mid-level '''Ranger 1900''', and the top-of-the-line '''Ranger 2500'''.  In 1974, a 2.8L engine was introduced to the Ranger family.  However, by that time the Rangers were unpopular, and were discontinued after the 1976 model year.  Most of these were sold exclusively in Continental Europe, especially the [[Benelux]] region.

South Africa used this body type for their Chevrolet 2500, 3800 and 4100 series.  They looked visually almost identical but had the Chevrolet 2500 (4 cylinder) or 3800 and 4100 (6 cylinder) engines installed.  They were available as four door saloon or estate.  The six cylinder versions could be differentiated from the "fours" as they had four round headlights as opposed to the two rectangular units.

These cars were also assembled in Iran (before revolution) from 1973 till 1977 under the "Chevrolet Royal" marque by Iran General Motors. The two models were 2500 and 2800 with 2.5L and 2.8L, respectively.

[[Image:Opel rekord e1 v sst.JPG|thumb|Opel Rekord E1 (Berlina version)]]
[[Image:Vaxhall Carlton firstincarnation Cambridge.JPG|thumb|A rebadged Rekord E2 &mdash; the Vauxhall Carlton]]

The E model can be subdivided into Rekord EI (1977&ndash;82) and Rekord EII (1982&ndash;86). Over 1.4 million units were made.

A version of the EI was sold by [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] in the [[United Kingdom]] from 1979 as the [[Vauxhall Carlton|Carlton]], which featured the distinct slanted front end shared with the [[Vauxhall Chevette|Chevette]] and [[Vauxhall Cavalier| Cavalier]]. The Carlton quietly succeeded the (by then long since discontinued) [[Vauxhall Victor|Vauxhall Victor FE]]. In the UK both models were outsold by the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]].

After the release of the EII in 1982, Vauxhall Carltons were distinguishable from Opel Rekords only by their badging, with no sheet metal changes.  Models sold in the UK had 2.0&nbsp;L petrol and 2.3&nbsp;L diesel engines in base, Berlina and Berlina S trim levels.

The Rekord EI was the basis of the original 1978 [[Holden VB Commodore]]. However, to cope with [[Australia]]n conditions it was strengthened substantially and used the Senator's nose (like the [[Opel Commodore]]) to accommodate the Holden straight-6 and V8 engines.

In [[South Africa]] the model was sold as a [[Chevrolet]] until 1982, when it was rebadged as an Opel. [[Delta Motor Corporation]], which bought out GM's South African subsidiary after it divested from the country in 1986, produced EII model until the early 1990s. Later South African Rekords featured the Opel badge above the grille, similar to the smaller Kadett. 

In [[Venezuela]], the Opel Rekord was sold as the successor of the [[Chevrolet Chevette]], but keeping the name. It sold through 1982 to 1986, in sedan and wagon models. This car is still commonly seen and restored, since its spare parts are still made and sold. It keeps a high level of popularity mainly because of the low prices of cars and parts. 

A version of the Rekord, known as the Royale, was produced by [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]], featuring the front end of the larger [[Opel Senator|Senator]]. This should not be confused with the [[Vauxhall Royale]], which was effectively a rebadged [[Opel Monza]]/Opel Senator.
