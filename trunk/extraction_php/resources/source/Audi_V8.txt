[[Image:V8Quattro.JPG|thumb|right|250px|1993 Audi V8 quattro (US)]]
The '''Audi V8''' is a [[full-size car|large]] [[luxury vehicle|luxury]] four-[[vehicle door|door]], five-[[car seat|seat]] [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] (sedan), built by [[Audi|Audi AG]] at its [[Neckarsulm]] plant in [[Germany]] from October 1988 to November 1993,<ref name="ETKA">[[ETKA]] official factory data</ref> as the company's range-topping flagship model.  It was the first car from the Audi [[marque]] to use its namesake engine configuration - a [[V8 engine]].

It was replaced by the [[Audi A8]] in 1994, though the A8 would not be sold in [[North America]] until the 1997 [[model year]].

==Overview==
The Audi V8 car featured as standard Audi's 'trademark' [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system,<ref name="Quattro25">Audi of America Press Site [http://media.audiusa.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=9540 25 Years of Audi Quattro] 22 February 2005</ref> and a [[multi-valve|32 valve]], [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshaft]] (DOHC) [[V8 engine]],<ref name="ETKA"/> with options of a five-speed [[manual transmission|manual]], six-speed manual, or four-speed electronically controlled [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[ZF 4HP24 transmission#4HP24A|4HP24A]] [[automatic transmission]]s,<ref name="ETKA"/> giving it the power and performance abilities to match the then comparable V8-powered offerings from [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]].

The Audi V8 was never a huge sales success despite the obvious qualities of the car.  From October 1988 to November 1993, approximately 21,000 Audi V8's were produced.{{Fact|date=May 2009|post-text=(please give a reliable source for this)}}  The range-topping Audi V8 was released at about the same time as the original [[Lexus LS400#first generation (UCF10)|Lexus LS400]], and in many respects, the Audi was a superior product both to the Lexus, and its German competitors such as the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|Mercedes S-Class]] ([[Mercedes-Benz W126]]), the [[BMW 7 Series]] ([[BMW E32]]), and the British [[Jaguar XJ]]-series ([[Jaguar XJ#Mark 2 - XJ40, XJ81, X300, X305 and X308 (1986–2003)|Jaguar XJ Mark 2, XJ40]]).{{Fact|date=June 2009}}  The Audi V8 was the only car in its class to offer four-wheel drive,<ref name="ETKA"/> and a fully [[galvanization|galvanised]] body as standard.

The Audi V8 was specifically designed to be a top of the range 'flagship' car, having what was then optional features like leather seating, and Audi's famous quattro 4wd<ref name="ETKA"/> - as standard.  However, this was reversed with the current [[Audi A8]], where the base model is equipped with [[front-wheel drive]], [[diesel engine]] - and the leather is an option!

The Audi V8 created a new 'elevated' image for its company, Audi AG, because customers and the motoring industry as a whole were now viewing Audi as a true manufacturer of prestigious [[luxury car]]s, providing a credible alternative to the then established competitors.  In that matter, this car was a real cornerstone in developing the history of the Audi [[marque]] as we know today.

Today, the V8 has a [[cult]] following in many countries, and many examples are in the hands of [[enthusiasm|enthusiasts]] who appreciate the quality and performance offered by what has turned out to be a durable and well-built car.

==Body style==
The [[car body style]] of the Audi V8 resembled the ''Type'' 44 [[Audi 100|Audi 100 and 200]] models,<ref name="ETKA"/> and was based on a stretched version of the [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C3|Volkswagen Group C3]] [[automobile platform]], known either as the D1 or D11<ref name="motor-klassik">{{cite web|url=http://www.motor-klassik.de/audi-audi-v8-d11_4c--1214573.html|title=Audi V8 (D11/4C) - Technische Daten|work=Motor Klassik|language=German|accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref> platform. The V8 differed from the Audi 100/200 in having a unique [[grille]] design, unique [[bumper (automobile)|bumpers]], extended [[wheelbase]], pronounced [[fender (vehicle)|wheel arches]], all-red [[automotive lighting|rear lights]], and 15" or 16" [[wheel|roadwheels]].  Much attention was lavished on the vehicle's new [[internal combustion engine]], namely a [[V8 engine]], although the Audi V8 was also significant in that it was the first production Audi road car to combine the quattro 4WD system with an [[automatic transmission]].

There was also long [[wheelbase]] (LWB) version which was {{convert|30|cm|0|lk=on}} longer than the standard V8 model, it was assembled at [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] factory in [[Graz]].  Approximately 300 long-wheelbase vehicles were produced.{{Clarify me|date=May 2009|post-text=(where was this info sourced?)}}

==Powertrain==
[[Powertrain]]<ref name="ETKA"/> detail of the Audi V8 eventually featured one of two all-new, all-[[aluminium alloy]] [[internal combustion engine]]s - both [[petrol engine]]s, and both V8s with [[multi-valve|thirty two valves]] (four [[poppet valve#internal combustion engine|valves]] per [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]) with dual valve [[spring (device)|springs]], and four [[overhead camshaft]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audiv8.com/german/technology/motor.html|title=Der Motor|publisher=AudiV8.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>  These new designs would set the pattern for future [[Volkswagen Group]] [[V8 engine]]s.  As well as using an all-aluminium alloy for the [[cylinder block]] (when the established material was [[gray iron|grey cast iron]]), the [[camshaft]]s were driven using hybrid methods.  A [[synthetic rubber|rubber]]/[[kevlar]] toothed [[timing belt]], driven from the front of the [[crankshaft]] drives just one of the [[overhead camshaft]]s - the exhaust camshafts in each [[cylinder head]].  The inlet camshafts are then driven via a [[simplex]] [[roller chain|roller]] [[chain]] from the exhaust camshaft - the right bank, comprising cylinders 1-4 at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cyls 5-8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timng belt.  This method effectively reduced the complexity of the [[valvetrain|valve gear drive]] timing belt layout (known to be very complex on [[V engine]]s), and as a result, required less components (idler rollers and guides) - leading to slightly easier (and therefore cheaper) maintenance of the timing belt and associated components.  The actual intervals for changing the timing belts do vary - the 3.6&nbsp;V8 ([[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#3.6 V8 184kW|PT]]) requires changing every {{convert|90000|km|-4|lk=on}}, whereas the 4.2&nbsp;V8 ([[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#4.2 V8 208kW|ABH]]) goes longer between intervals at {{convert|120000|km|-3|abbr=on}}.  A [[thermostat]]ically controlled electric [[fan (mechanical)|cooling fan]] also became standard, replacing the engine-driven [[viscous]] [[fan clutch|fans]] on earlier cars.  This not only provided forced airflow for the engine [[coolant]] [[radiator]], but also for the smaller [[motor oil|engine oil]] cooler too.

Both engines use a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] [[engine control unit]] (ECU), with cylinder-bank selective knock control, dual barrel throttle valve, [[lambda]] mixture control via intake air volume metering and exhaust gas temperature sensor, and require [[gasoline|unleaded petrol]].  Fuel is delivered to the [[combustion chamber]]s via eight manifold-sited electronic [[fuel injection|fuel injectors]], fed from two [[common rail|common fuel rails]] (one per cylinder bank), and are sequentially 'fired' or activated in accordance with the engine [[firing order]].  It is important to note though - whilst the 3.6&nbsp;V8 is able to use 95&nbsp;[[octane rating#RON|RON]] fuel, for the 4.2&nbsp;V8, the more expensive 98&nbsp;RON 'SuperPlus' unleaded is required in order to make the quoted power outputs.  The use of 95&nbsp;RON in the 4.2&nbsp;V8 will result in a lower power output, as well as increased fuel consumption.

A choice of [[transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] were offered - either a five-speed [[manual transmission|manual gearbox]] (parts code prefix: 016, identification code: AWW) ([[gear ratio]]s- 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.231, 4th: 0.903, 5th: 0.730) with a {{convert|240|mm|1|lk=on}} single-plate [[clutch]], or a [[ZF Friedrichshafen]]-sourced four-speed [[ZF 4HP24 transmission#4HP24A|4HP24A]] [[automatic transmission]] with a [[torque converter]] (parts code prefix: 018, identification codes: AKD, AYU, AZG).

Audi's now proven 'trademark' [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent (or semi-permanent, dependent on gearbox type) [[four-wheel drive]] system was the only offering for the driveline.  The rear axle final drive unit (parts code prefix: 017, identification codes: AFV, AXZ) contains a [[Torsen]] Automatic Torque Biasing (ATB) [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]], instead of the more common planetary-geared open differential.  The final drive ratio is 4.111.

====3.6====
From initial launch of the Audi V8, the only offering was the 3.6&nbsp;[[litre]] ({{convert|3562|cc|1|lk=on}}) powerplant.<ref name="ETKA"/>  This [[V8 engine]] was rated with a [[motive power]] output of {{convert|184|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}, and a turning force of {{convert|340|Nm|0|lk=on}}.
====4.2====
In August 1991, and identified by red-coloured 'V8' badging, Audi introduced a 4.2&nbsp;litre ({{convert|4172|cc|1|abbr=on}}) powerplant,<ref name="ETKA"/> to compliment the choice of the existing 3.6&nbsp;litre V8.  This shared many components from the 3.6&nbsp;V8, and this 4.2 unit was identical to the V8 used in the [[Audi S4#C4|C4 S4]] (aka ''Ur-S4''), sharing the same rated outputs and [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#4.2 V8 206kW|ABH]] identification code.  Like the 3.6&nbsp;V8 model, the existing four-speed automatic gearbox remainded available.  However, a new six-speed manual gearbox (parts code prefix: 01E, identification codes: CBM, CBN) ([[gear ratio]]s- 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857-CBM, 0.806-CBN, 6th: 0.730-CBM, 0.684-CBN) replaced the five-speed manual.<ref name="ETKA"/>

==Steering, brakes, wheels==
The Audi V8 came equipped with [[power steering|power assisted]] (PAS) rack and pinion [[steering]] as standard.<ref name="ETKA"/>  An electronically controlled variable assisted 'servotronic' version was also available.<ref name="ETKA"/>

It was fitted with a high performance [[brake]] system,<ref name="ETKA"/> which included radially ventilated [[disc brake]]s front and rear.  The fronts were rather unusual - sized at {{convert|310|mm|2|lk=on}} in diameter by {{convert|25|mm|3|abbr=on}} thick, but mounted the caliper inside the disc - and often coined the phrase "UFO brakes".<ref>AudiV8.com [http://www.audiv8.com/german/technology/bremsen.html Die innenumgriffene Scheibenbremse (UFO)] {{de icon}}</ref>  The fronts also incorporated electronic brake pad wear sensors.  The rears were {{convert|269|mm|2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|20|mm|3|abbr=on}}, and incorporated a cable operated parking brake.  A [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS) was also standard.

Standard [[wheel|roadwheels]]<ref name="ETKA"/> were 7.5J&nbsp;x&nbsp;15&nbsp;H2&nbsp;ET35 'aero' style light [[alloy wheel]]s shod with 215/60&nbsp;R15 steel belted radial [[tire|tyres]].  An optional multi-spoke [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG|BBS]] sourced (with Audi badge) alloy wheels were also available, in either 8.0J&nbsp;x&nbsp;16, or 8.0J&nbsp;x&nbsp;17 sizes.

==Features==
[[File:Audi V8 innen.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Audi V8 interior (notice [[GSM]] phone mounted is not standard)]]
The Audi V8 came standard with a range of usually optional features as standard;<ref name="ETKA"/> including [[Bose Corporation|BOSE]] audio system with six speakers, 'nut tree' ([[walnut]]) wood trim, [[leather]] interior, front and rear heated seats, and a built-in [[GSM]] car phone.

==Motorsport==
[[File:Audiv8 dtm.JPG|thumb|left|Audi V8 DTM]]
Audi developed a [[Group A]] competition version of the Audi V8 for entry into the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM) (German Touring car Championship) [[auto racing]] series, and began racing with it in 1990 with Schmidt MotorSport (SMS) running the operation, and [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]], [[Walter Röhrl]] and [[Frank Jelinski]] driving.  Stuck won the title, and the following year, Audi added a second team to the mix, Audi Zentrum Reutlingen (AZR).  SMS continued with Stuck and Jelinski, while AZR raced with [[Frank Biela]] and [[Hubert Haupt]].  Biela gave Audi another crown in 1991, but was unable to defend the title in 1992.

For the 1992 season, Audi had changed their [[internal combustion engine|engines]] to use a flatplane [[crankshaft]], which they said had been re-[[forged]] and bent from the original [[crossplane]] part.  The DTM organisers found this highly modified crankshaft deviated from original [[homologation|homologated]] standard crankshaft, and therefore deemed it illegal.  Audi subsequently withdrew from the championship.{{clr}}
