The '''Smart Formore''' was a small [[all wheel drive]] [[SUV]], riding on the same [[automobile platform|platform]] as the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class]]. The architecture would be shared with the [[Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class]], a proposed SUV that would be smaller than the [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class|M-Class]]. Power would have ranged from a 1.8&nbsp;L [[straight-4]] to a 3.0&nbsp;L [[V6]], including Diesel versions. Production was to have been carried out at DaimlerChrysler's factory in [[Juiz de Fora]], [[Brazil]], rather than the French Smartville factory.

The Formore was to be Smart's first official entry in the United States market as a [[Mini SUV]] that seats 4-5. However, [[DaimlerChrysler]] is considering a limited entry into the market, with just the Fortwo, essentially in urban areas. Development of the Formore has been halted since [[April 2005]], due to DaimlerChrysler's monetary concerns (the Smart brand had yet to make a profit after eight years in operation, and the Formore was costing more money to develop than anticipated).

The vehicle was to be unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Auto Show, but the event was cancelled. In 2009, a prototype vehicle was found in a Mercedes-Benz storage facility in Germany.<ref>[http://jalopnik.com/5239756/stillborn-smart-formore-suv-concept-found-in-shed Stillborn Smart "ForMore" SUV Concept Found In Shed]</ref>
