The '''Opel GT''' is a two-seat [[sports car]] first presented as a styling exercise in 1965 at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris]] and [[Frankfurt Motor Show|Frankfurt]] motor shows, and introduced as a production model late in 1968<ref name=Autocar1968>{{cite journal| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Opel GT Corvette for Europe?| journal = [[Autocar]]| volume = vol 129 (nbr 3790)| page = page 55 |date = date 3 October 1968}}</ref>  by [[Opel]], a [[Germany|German]] subsidiary of [[General Motors]]. It relied partly on components from the contemporary [[Opel Kadett|Opel Kadett B]] and had a body made by [[France|French]] contractor [[Brissonneau & Lotz]].

Its styling has been likened to the 1968 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] which went on sale in September 1968.<ref>[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/opel-gt.htm Opel GT at Howstuffworks.com]</ref>

Although the life of the GT was limited to six model years, after a 34-year hiatus it returned as a 2007 model based on the [[Saturn Sky]], and is built alongside it in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]], [[United States|USA]]. The plant was scheduled to close in July 2009, ending production of the GT, and its siblings.

==General information==
The Opel GT was equipped with a base 1.1&nbsp;L [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[straight-4]] engine, which produced 67&nbsp;hp (SAE) at 6000&nbsp;rpm. However, most buyers chose an optional 1.9&nbsp;L Cam-In-Head (CIH) engine, which produced 102&nbsp;hp (SAE) at 5200 to 5400&nbsp;rpm. Some of the early 1968 models also came with a slightly higher compression "H" code cylinder head. In 1971, due to emissions regulations, Opel reduced the [[compression ratio]] of the U.S.1.9&nbsp;L engine and output fell to 83&nbsp;hp (SAE). There was also a GT/J model, which was a less expensive version of the 1900GT sold only in Europe. Standard transmission was a manual 4-speed. A three-speed automatic was available with the 1.9&nbsp;L engine. The model run of the Opel GT was from 1968 to 1973.

The Opel GT used a steel unibody and a conventional [[FR layout|front-engined, rear-wheel drive layout]]. The Cam-In-Head (CIH) engine was mounted far back in the chassis to improve weight distribution. Front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] consisted of upper [[Control arm|A-arms]] and a lower transverse leaf spring. A live axle and coil springs were used in the rear. The power-assisted braking system used discs in the front, drums in the rear. Steering was unassisted.

One unusual feature of the Opel GT was the operation of the [[Hidden headlamps|pop-up headlights]]. They were manually operated, by way of a large lever along the center console next to the shifter. Unlike most pop-up headlights, they both rotated in the same direction (counterclockwise from inside the car) about a longitudinal axis. One standard joke about GT owners was that you can easily spot them due to the heavy muscles on their right arm built up by using the lever to pop up the headlights.

The Opel GT was a [[fastback]], that had neither an externally accessible trunk nor a conventional [[hatchback]]. There was a parcel shelf behind the seats that could only be accessed through the main doors. Behind the parcel shelf was a fold-up panel that concealed a spare tire and jack.

The interior of the Opel GT was surprisingly large for a car its size, owing to its original design process (exterior metal was sculpted around an interior model). Headroom and legroom were sufficient for those over 6&nbsp;feet (1.83&nbsp;m) tall.

During 1968 to 1973, a total of 103,463 cars were sold. The most [[collectable]] GTs are probably the first few hundred cars hand-assembled in 1968 and the 1968–1969 models with the 1.1&nbsp;L engine, which totaled out at 3,573 cars. Of the later cars 10,760 were the cheaper model (GT/J), which lacked nearly all chrome parts and less standard features. In some markets, items like a [[limited slip differential]], front and rear anti-sway bars, heated rear window and engine bay light were standard, although most cars were shipped without them.

==Appearances in media==
The Opel GT was Agent [[Maxwell Smart]]'s car in the last season of the comedy TV series ''[[Get Smart]]''. Agent 86 (Maxwell Smart) drove a GT in several episodes, with the car featuring prominently in the opening credits. In the 2008 movie adaptation ''Get Smart'', [[Bernie Kopell]] (who played Siegfried in the original ''Get Smart'' series) makes a [[cameo appearance]] in which he drives a GT. This is a reference to the original cars of ''Get Smart'', as the [[Sunbeam Tiger]] and the [[VW Karmann Ghia]] (Maxwell Smart's cars in Season 1-2 and 3-4, respectively) are in the scene with the GT.

==Classic GTs today==
The Opel GT shared many parts with other Opel models, mostly the [[Opel Kadett|Kadett B]]. Opel also used variants of the CIH engine from 1966 to 1995, so most parts are somewhat available. Also, in the USA and Europe, there are companies which specialize in Opel GT parts and services; including some new body parts. Some of the rarest and most costly parts are the ignition switches, rear trim strips, and 1968–1970 rear axle bearings.

One can fairly easily adapt larger engines, transmissions and brakes from newer Opels. For example, a fuel-injected 2.0&nbsp;L engine (110&nbsp;hp DIN) and a 5-speed [[Getrag]] manual transmission from an [[Opel Rekord|Rekord E]] or [[Opel Manta|Manta B]] may be used to improve both fuel economy and performance.

On February 1, 2006, Opel issued a [[press release]] announcing the upcoming production of a new Opel GT, as a likely 2007 model. The car shares the [[GM Kappa platform]] with the [[Pontiac Solstice]] and the [[Saturn Sky]]. Unlike its platform mates, the 2.0&nbsp;L, {{convert|194|kW|PS hp|1|abbr=on}} [[direct injection]] [[turbocharged]] [[GM Family II engine#SIDI|Ecotec]] four-cylinder engine is the only engine being offered.  It also features 18-inch alloy wheels and a folding cloth top similar to those found on the Solstice and the Sky. Since [[Saturn Corporation|GM's Saturn division]] already shares models with Opel, the GT is in fact Opel's version of the [[Saturn Sky]]. The car replaced the [[Opel Speedster]] in the European lineup; however, it is not sold in right-hand drive in the UK, thus there is no replacement for the [[Vauxhall VX220]].  The situation is similar to [[Holden]] in Australia, as the Saturn Sky and Pontiac Solstice are produced at a North American plant, which does not have the necessary tooling for producing right-hand drive vehicles.

Production ended with the closure of the [[Wilmington Assembly]] plant in July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=GM Pulls Ahead U.S. Plant Closures; Reaffirms Intent to Build Future Small Car in U.S.|url=http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=827&docid=54632|publisher=GM Media Online|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref> On September 10th, 2009 a deal was made by the consortium led by [[Magna International]] acquired GM Europe, which includes [[Germany]]'s [[Opel]] and the [[UK]]'s[[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8247971.stm |title=Business &#124; Opel and Vauxhall to go to Magna |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref>
