{{Executive}}
'''President''' is a [[title]] held by many leaders of [[organization]]s, [[company|companies]], [[trade union]]s, [[university|universities]], and [[country|countries]]. [[Etymology|Etymologically]], a "president" is one who [[Wiktionary:Preside|presides]], who sits in leadership (from [[Latin]] ''pre-'' "before" + ''sedere'' "to sit"; giving the term ''[[praeses]]''). Originally, the term referred to the presiding officer of a ceremony or meeting (i.e., [[chairman]]), but today it most commonly refers to an official. Among other things, ''president'' today is a common title for the [[head of state|heads of state]] of most [[republic]]s, whether popularly [[election|elected]], chosen by the [[legislature]] or by a special [[electoral college]]. It is also often adopted by [[dictator]]s.

==History==
{{main|History of president}}
As an English word,  the term was originally used to refer to the presiding officer of a committee or governing body in Great Britain. Early examples are the President of the [[Exchequer]] ("presidentis" in the original [[Latin]], from the [[Dialogue concerning the Exchequer]], 1179), the presidents of the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (from 1464), and the founding [[President of the Royal Society]] ([[William Brouncker]], 1660).

Later this usage was applied to political leaders, including the leaders of some of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] (originally Virginia in 1608); in full, the "President of the Council".<ref>[[OED]], ''s. v.''</ref> The first president of a country was [[George Washington]], the [[President of the United States]]. In America the title was "upgraded" from its earlier use for the [[President of the Continental Congress]], the "officer in charge of the [[Continental Congress]]" since 1774. As other countries deposed their monarchies and became republics, ''president'' was commonly adopted as the title for the head of state. The first European president was the [[president of France]], a post created in the [[Second French Republic|Second Republic]] of 1848. The first president of an internationally recognized African state was the [[President of Liberia]] in 1848. Today, most [[republic]]s have a President as their head of state.

== Presidents as head of state ==
=== Presidents in democratic countries ===
==== Presidential systems ====
In states with a [[presidential system]] of [[government]], the president exercises the functions of [[Head of State]] and [[Head of Government]], i.e. he or she directs the executive branch of government. 

Presidents in this system are either ''directly'' elected by popular vote or ''indirectly'' elected by an electoral college. 

In the [[United States of America]], the [[President of the United States|president]] is ''indirectly'' elected by the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]] made up of electors chosen by voters in the presidential election. In most U.S. states, each elector is committed to voting for a specified candidate determined by the popular vote in each state, so that the people, in voting for each elector, are in effect voting for the candidate. However, in four close U.S. elections ([[U.S. presidential election, 1824|1824]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1876|1876]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1888|1888]], [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]]), the candidate with the most popular votes still lost the electoral count. 

In [[Mexico]], the [[President of Mexico|president]] is ''directly'' elected for a six-year term by popular vote. The candidate who wins the most votes is elected president even if he or she does not have an absolute majority. In Mexico, every presidential election will always be a non-incumbent election. The [[Mexican general election, 2006|2006 Mexican elections]] had a fierce competition, the electoral results showed a minimal difference between the two most voted candidates and such difference was just about the 0.58% of the total vote. The [[Federal Electoral Tribunal]] declared an elected President after a controversial post-electoral process.

In [[Brazil]], the [[President of Brazil|president]] is ''directly'' elected for a four-year term by popular vote. A candidate has to have more than 50% of the valid votes. If no candidates achieve a majority of the votes, there is a [[runoff election]] between the two candidates with most votes. Again, a candidate needs a majority of the vote to be elected. In Brazil, a president cannot be elected to more than two consecutive terms, but there is no limit on the number of terms a president can serve.

Many [[South America]]n, [[Central America]]n, and [[Africa]]n nations follow the presidential model.

==== Semi-presidential systems ====
A third system is the [[semi-presidential system]], also known as the [[France|French]] system, in which like the Parliamentary system there is both a president and a prime minister, but unlike the parliamentary system, the president may have significant day-to-day power. When his party controls the majority of seats in the National Assembly, the president can operate closely with the parliament and prime minister, and work towards a common agenda. When the National Assembly is controlled by opponents of the President however, the president can find himself marginalized with the opposition party prime minister exercising most of the power. Though the prime minister remains an appointee of the president, the president must obey the rules of parliament, and select a leader from the house's majority holding party. Thus, sometimes the president and prime minister can be allies, sometimes rivals; the latter situation is known as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]. Variants of the French semi-presidential system, developed at the beginning of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] by [[Charles de Gaulle]], are used in [[France]], [[Finland]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and several [[post-colonial]] countries which have emulated the French model.

==== Parliamentary systems ====
{{seealso|Parliamentary systems|Parliamentary republics}}
Another system is the [[Parliamentary republic]], where the Presidency is largely ceremonial. This system is mainly used in former one-party states and constitutional monarchies. Countries using this system include the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Malta]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Iceland]],[[Germany]] and [[Greece]].

==== Collective Presidency ====
Only a tiny minority of modern republics do not have a single head of state; examples include:
* [[Switzerland]], where the headship of state is collectively vested in the seven-member [[Swiss Federal Council]] despite the fact the system includes a [[President of the Swiss Confederation|president of the Confederation]]. The president is a member of the Federal Council elected by the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]] (the Swiss [[Parliament]]) for a year ([[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] mandates that the post rotates every [[New Year's Day]]).
* The [[List of Captains Regent of San Marino|Captains Regent of]] [[San Marino]] elected by the [[Grand and General Council]].
* In the [[Soviet Union]], while the real power was exercised by the [[General Secretary|general secretary]] of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]], the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] executed powers of collective [[head of state]], and its [[chairman]] was often called "president" in the [[Western World|West]].

===Presidents in dictatorships===
In [[dictatorship]]s, the title is frequently taken by self-appointed and/or military-backed leaders. Such is the case in many African states; [[Idi Amin]] in [[Uganda]], for example.

[[President for Life]] is a title assumed by some [[dictator]]s to ensure that their authority or legitimacy is never questioned.

[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] appointed himself in 82 BC to an entirely new office, dictator [[rei publicae]] constituendae causa, which was functionally identical to the dictatorate rei gerendae causa except that it lacked any set time limit, although Sulla held this office for over two years before he voluntarily abdicated and retired from public life.
The second well-known incident of a leader extending his term indefinitely was Roman dictator [[Julius Caesar]], who made himself "[[Roman dictator|Perpetual Dictator]]" (commonly mistranslated as 'Dictator-for-life') in 45 BC. His actions would later be mimicked by the French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who was appointed "First Consul for life" in 1802.

Ironically, most leaders who proclaim themselves President for Life do not in fact successfully serve a life term. Even so presidents like [[Alexandre Sabès dit Pétion]], [[Rafael Carrera]], [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[François Duvalier]] died in office.

The last living person to be officially proclaimed president for life was the late [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] of [[Turkmenistan]].

Several presidents have ruled until their death, but they have not officially proclaimed themselves as President for Life. For instance, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] of [[Romania]], who ruled until his [[execution]] (see [[Romanian revolution]]).

=== Presidential symbols ===
As the country's head of state, in most countries the president is entitled to certain perquisites, and may have a prestigious residence; often a lavish mansion or palace, sometimes more than one (e.g. summer and winter residence, country retreat) - for a list see [[Official residence]].

Furthermore in some nations the Presidency enjoys certain symbols of office, such as an official uniform, decorations, a presidential seal, coat of arms, flag and other visible accessories; military honours such as [[gun salute]]s, [[Ruffles and flourishes]], and a presidential guard. A common presidential symbol is the [[presidential sash]]es worn by [[Latin America]]n presidents as a symbol of the presidency's continuity, and presenting the sash to the new president.

== Presidential titles for non heads of state ==
=== As head of government ===
Some countries with parliamentary systems use a term meaning/translating as 'president' (in some languages indistinguishable from chairman) for the head of parliamentary government, often as [[President of the Government]], [[President of the Council of Ministers]] or [[President of the Executive Council]].

However, such an official is explicitly not the president of the ''country''. Rather, he is called a [[president (history of the term)|president in an older sense of the word]] to denote the fact that he heads the ''[[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]''. A separate [[head of state]] generally exists in their country that instead serves as the president or monarch of the country.

Thus, such officials are really [[premier]]s, and to avoid confusion are often described simply as 'prime minister' when being mentioned internationally.

There are several examples for this kind of presidency:
* The official title of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] is [[President of the Council of Ministers]] (''[[Italian language|Italian]] Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri'')
* Under the French [[French Third Republic|Third]] and the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republics]], the "[[President of the Council]]" (of ministers - or prime minister) was the head of government, with the [[President of the French Republic|President of the Republic]] a largely symbolic figurehead.
* The [[Prime minister]] of the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922 to 1937 was titled [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State]]. At the same time, the Irish Free State was a constitutional monarchy with a reigning monarch, the [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|King of Ireland]], as well as a resident [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] carrying out many head of state functions.
* The [[Prime Minister of Spain]] is officially referred to as the President of the Government of [[Spain]], and informally known as the "president". Spain is also a kingdom with a reigning [[King of Spain|king]].
* The official title of the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Polish prime minister]] is [[President of the Council of Ministers]] (''[[Polish language|Polish]] Prezes Rady Ministrów'')
*In British constitutional practice, the chairman of an [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]], acting in such a capacity, is known as a [[President of the Executive Council]]. Usually this person is the [[Governor]] and it always stays like that.

=== Other executive positions ===
==== Sub-national presidents====
President can also be the title of the chief executive at a lower administrative level, such as the [[Parish President|parish president]]s of the [[parish]]es of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]], the presiding member of city council for villages in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]], or the [[municipal president]]s of [[Mexico]]'s [[municipio (Mexico)|municipalities]]. Perhaps the best known sub-national presidents are the [[borough president]]s of the [[borough (New York City)|Five Boroughs]] of [[New York City]].
====Québec====
In [[Québec]], [[Canada]] the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the National Assembly of Quebec is termed [[President of the National Assembly of Quebec|President]] since 1968

====Presidential ranks====
Below a President, there can be a number of vice-presidents.  This rank does not hold the same power, but power can be transferred in special circumstances.  Normally Vice-Presidents hold some power and special responsibilities below that of the President.

===Judiciary===
====France====
In [[France|French]] legal terminology, the president of a court consisting of multiple [[judge]]s is the foremost judge; he chairs the meeting of the court and directs the debates (and this thus addressed as "Mr President", ''Monsieur le Président'', or appropriate feminine forms). In general, a court comprises several chambers, each with its own president; thus the most senior of these is called the "first president" (as in: "the First President of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] is the most senior judge in France").  Similarly in English legal practice the most senior judge in each division uses this title (e.g. President of the Family Division, President of the Court of Appeal).

====Scotland====
The [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] is head of the judiciary in [[Scotland]], and presiding judge (and Senator) of the [[College of Justice]] and [[Court of Session]], as well as being Lord Justice General of Scotland and head of the [[High Court of Justiciary]], the offices having been combined in 1784.

=== Non-governmental presidents ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Nintendo]] -->
''President'' is also used as a title in some non-governmental organizations.

The head of a university or non-profit corporation, particularly in the United States of America, is often known as president. In academic or education systems with multiple independent campuses, the relationship between the roles of [[university president]] and [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] can become quite complicated. President is also a title in many corporations. In some cases the president acts as [[chief operating officer]] under the direction of the [[chief executive officer]]. Alternatively, in the U.S., the chairperson of the [[board of directors]] may be called the president.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the head of the church is known as the [[President of the Church (Mormonism)|President]]. Together with his two counselors, they are known as the [[First Presidency]]. This pattern is repeated throughout the church in [[Quorum (Mormonism)|quorums]] and in other bodies, each of which is led by a president.  The [[Methodist Church]] in the UK (and also other provinces) is led by the President of the Methodist Council, and assumes the role of leading minister and spokesperson.

Many other organisations, clubs, and committees, both political and non-political are led by Presidents as well. Examples can vary from the President of a [[political party]], to the president of a [[chamber of commerce]], to the President of a [[students' union]] and even the president of a [[high school]] chess club.

{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}
*The powers, functions and functioning of presidents were reviewed by six international experts for Australia's [[Republic Advisory Committee]] in 1993. Reports by among others Professor [[Klaus Von Beyme]] (on Germany), [[A. G. Noorani]] (on India), [[Jim Duffy (author)|Jim Duffy]] (on Ireland) and Sir [[Ellis Clarke]] (on Trinidad and Tobago) outline the role of various presidencies. The full report is called ''An Australian Republic: The Options - The Appendices'' (ISBN 0-644-32589-5)
