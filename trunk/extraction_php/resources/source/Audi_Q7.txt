The '''Audi Q7''' is a [[full-size]] [[crossover SUV|luxury crossover SUV]] produced by [[Germany|German]] automaker [[Audi]] since its unveiling at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006.

In its name '''Q7''', the "'''Q'''" denotes a new family of vehicles for Audi, and the designation "'''7'''" marks its placement between the [[Audi A6|A6]] and [[Audi A8|A8]] in Audi's model range.

==Overview==
The Q7 (internally designated ''Typ 4L'') utilises a modified version of the [[Volkswagen Group PL71 platform]].  Based on the [[Audi Pikes Peak quattro]] [[concept car]], the Q7 is designed more for on-road use, and was not meant for serious off-road use where a [[transfer case]] is needed.  In an off road test through the Australian outback it fared well for a "soft roader",{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} but in a test published in The Sunday Times it was described as "an absolutely useless off-roader".<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/article687697.ece Times Online]</ref>  Although it lacks a low-range transfer case, it has [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent four wheel drive system with a central differential lock, and an adjustable-height air suspension which helps in off road situations.

==First generation (2005-)==
===Features===
*Q7 offers a feature marketed as AMI, or Audi Music Interface, to allow user manipulation of an iPod or similar MP3-style player, which can play through the main sound system.
*Q7 was the first Audi model to offer Side Assist, a type of blind-spot detection and warning system.

0-100 KM/h performance for Q7 3.6 V6 FSI is 8.5s, and for 4.2 V8 FSI is 7.4S.

===Safety===
Despite its multiple airbags and safety electronics, such as [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP), the Q7 scored only four stars out of five ({{rating|4|5}}) in the [[Euro NCAP]] crash test for adult occupant protection.<ref name="carautoportal">{{cite web|url=http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-q7.php|title=Audi A7 Reference|accessdate=2009-06-26|work=carautoportal.com}}</ref>  According to Audi, this was caused by a design error, and has since been fixed in cars manufactured after the test which should allegedly lead to five stars.  Official tests to prove this remain to be done as of March 2009.

However in the [[United States|USA]], the Q7 received five out of five stars ({{rating|5|5}}) from the [[NHTSA]] safety test for both front and side impacts.  The [[IIHS]] awarded the Q7 its Top Safety Pick, with ''Good'' ratings in all 14 measured categories of the front and side impact test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=1007 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Audi Q7 |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref>

===Lawsuit on the use of the letter Q===
In early 2005, [[Nissan]] North America Inc. filed a lawsuit against Audi over the use of the letter "Q" as a model name.<ref>[http://www.audiworld.com/news/05/q_name/content.shtml Audi Sued by Nissan Over Q]</ref>

Audi is using the "Q" for the designation of their [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] [[four-wheel drive]] system, used in production cars for over twenty-five years (Audi's '''quattro''' trademark is actually an umbrella term for several types of four wheel drive systems developed by [[Torsen]], [[Haldex Traction]] AB, and [[Borg-Warner]], the latter being used in the Q7).  Nissan's [[Infiniti]] marque had been using Q as the name for sedans (the [[Infiniti Q45|Q45]]) and [[SUV]]s (the [[Infiniti QX4|QX4]] and [[Infiniti QX56|QX56]]) since 1989.

A settlement between Audi AG and Nissan was reached in late 2006.  The agreement stipulates that Audi will only use the Q-prefix for two models, the [[Audi Q5|Q5]] and the Q7.

==Facelift (2009-)==
The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/08/26/audi-slaps-monroney-on-updated-2010-q7/ Audi slaps Monroney on updated 2010 Q7]</ref>
