The '''Mercedes-Benz W125 Rekordwagen''' was an [[Experiment|experimental]], [[high-speed automobile]] produced in the late 1930s. The streamlined car was derived from the open-wheel race car [[Mercedes-Benz W125]] '''Formel-Rennwagen''', of which also a streamlined version was raced in 1937 at the [[AVUS]] in [[Berlin]]. The main difference to the Grand Prix race car, which had to adhere to the {{convert|750|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} limit, was a bigger, heavier and more powerful engine.

The car is at display in the [[Mercedes-Benz Museum]] [http://www.mercedes-benz.com/content/mbcom/international/international_website/en/com/international_home/home/heritage_new/history_new/racing_new/record_breaking_vehicles.html] in Stuttgart.

== The record ==
[[Rudolf Caracciola]]'s record of 432.7 km/h (268 mph) over the flying kilometre on 28 January 1938, still remains the fastest ever officially timed speed on a public road {{as of|2006|lc=on}}. It also was the fastest speed ever recorded in [[Germany]] until [[Rico Anthes]] bettered it with a [[Top Fuel]] [[Drag racing|Dragster]] on the [[Hockenheimring]] [[Dragstrip|drag strip]].

This record breaking run was made on the Reichs-[[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] between [[Frankfurt]] and [[Darmstadt]], where onlookers were rattled by the brutal boom of the side spewing exhaust stacks as the silver car hurtled past. By nine that morning, Caracciola and team chief [[Alfred Neubauer]] were having a celebration breakfast at the Park Hotel in Frankfurt.

Sadly, popular driver [[Bernd Rosemeyer]] was later killed when trying to beat that record for [[Auto Union]]. This also put an end to the record attempts of Mercedes, even though [[Hans Stuck]] later wanted to beat the overall [[land speed record]] with the [[Porsche]]-designed [[Mercedes-Benz T80]] which was powered by a {{convert|3000|hp}} airplane engine.
