'''Fafnir''' was a German engine and [[vehicle manufacturer]] based in [[Aachen]]. They made a range of cars between 1908 and 1926.<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite book |last=Georgano |first=N. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile |year=2000 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |id=ISBN 1-57958-293-1}}</ref>

The company was originally founded in 1894 producing needles. With the growth of the bicycle industry they started to make wheel spokes. In 1898 the company was registered as Carl Schwanemeyer, Aachener Stahlwaarenfabrik AG".

From 1902 the name "Fafnir" started to be used on the company's products including a range of motorcycle engines.

==Omnimobil and early car production==

In 1904 the company started to produce kits consisting of an engine and associated components to allow others, particularly bicycle makers, to enter into motor vehicle production. These were sold under the name "Omnimobil". The kit at first was based around a two cylinder engine rated at 6 [[Horsepower|HP]] with later a larger option with a four cylinder 16 HP unit. 

Beginning in 1908 finished cars were manufactured with the type "274" with a 1520[[Cubic_centimetre|cc]] engine and a maximum speed of 60 km/h and the type "284" with 2012cc capable of 70 km/h. The engines had overhead inlet and side exhaust valves.

By 1912 six different models were available at prices between 4100 and 16000 [[German_Reichsmark|RM]]. 

==Post World War I cars==
In 1919 the company changed its name to Aachener Stahlwaarenfabrik Fafnir-AG. The pre war 1924&nbsp;cc Typ 472 and 2496&nbsp;cc Typ 384 were re-introduced and a new Typ 471 with 1950&nbsp;cc engine announced which could be bought with a supercharger. 

The Typ "471" proved to be the last car model made and survived in production until 1927.

==Motor sport==
Fafnir had its own racing team running up to seven cars with drivers including [[Rudolf Caracciola]]. 

==Closure==

Fafnir production methods were very labour intensive, and with the difficult trading conditions of the 1920s failed to compete with the large manufacturers. Prices were reduced, but losses mounted and with debts of 1.8 million RM the banks forced the company into bankruptcy in 1925 with a resulting closure in 1926.
