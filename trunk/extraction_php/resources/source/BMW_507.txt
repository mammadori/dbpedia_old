The '''BMW 507 TS''' is a [[roadster]] produced by [[BMW]] from 1956 to 1959.

==Development==
The BMW 507 TS, or "Touring Sport," was the brainchild of BMW importer [[Max Hoffman]], who in 1954 persuaded the BMW management to produce a [[roadster]] version of the [[BMW 501]] and [[BMW 502]] saloons that could compete with [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[sports car]]s. Hoffman pushed for designer [[Albrecht von Goertz|Albrecht "Zeppo" Goertz]], who also designed the contemporary [[BMW 503]], as the designer, over existing designs by [[Ernst Loof]], whose sketches Hoffman felt were not commercially viable. Goertz was hired by BMW in November 1954. BMW engineer [[Fritz Fiedler]] was assigned to design the mechanical package, using existing components wherever possible.

The 507 made its debut at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] Hotel in New York in the summer of 1955 <ref name="Seeliger"> {{cite book |title=BMW 503/507 |last=Seeliger |first=Georg |year=1993 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-01563-3 |page=83}}  </ref>. Production began in November 1956. Max Hoffman intended the 507 to sell for about $5,000 U.S., which he believed would allow a production run of 5,000 units a year. Instead, high production costs pushed the cost in Germany to [[German mark|DM]] 26,500 (later 29,950)<ref>{{cite book |title=Deutsche Autos 1945-1990, vol.4 |last=Oswald |first=Werner |year=2001 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02131-5 |page=172}}; a contemporary [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] was DM 32,500. </ref>, driving the U.S. price initially to $9,000 and ultimately $10,500<ref>{{cite book |title=Standard Catalog of Imported Cars 1946-2002 |last=Covello |first=Mike |year=2002 |publisher=Krause Publications |location=Iola |isbn=0-87341-605-8 |pages=137–38}}</ref>.  Despite attracting celebrity buyers including [[Hans Stuck]] and [[Georg Meier|Georg "Schorsch" Meier]], the car never once reached more than 10% of the sales volumes achieved by its [[Mercedes-Benz|Stuttgart rival]], the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]].<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197712>{{cite journal| authorlink = Helmut Eicker | title = Die Grossten von Gestern: Auto Motor und Sport fuhr einen BMW 507 Jahrgang 1959 ''(Yesterday's greatest: Auto Motor und Sport drove a 1959 BMW 507)''| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = Heft 12 1977| pages = Pages 54 - 58|date = date 8 June 1977}}</ref>

Intended to revive BMW's sporting image, the 507 instead took BMW to the edge of [[bankruptcy]] -- the company's losses for 1959 were DM 15 million. The company lost money on each 507 built, and production was terminated in late 1959 <ref name="Seeliger"> {{cite book |title=BMW 503/507 |last=Seeliger |first=Georg |year=1993 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-01563-3 |pages=138, 206}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bmw-konzernarchiv.de/1/webmill.php?id=158078&foldertype=auto&foldergroup=irc&ditem=116745&dmodule=501&lin=detail&browsefolder=1208807807&t_browse=1 BMW Konzernarchiv<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Only 252 were built, plus two [[prototypes]]. Fortunately for the company, an infusion of [[Financial capital|capital]] from [[Herbert Quandt]] and the launch of new, cheaper models (the [[BMW 700]], [[Isetta]] and eventually the [[BMW New Class#1|'New Class' 1500]]) helped the company recover. 

The 507 prototype remains a milestone model for its attractive styling, which attracted some famous buyers. American icon [[Elvis Presley]] was the most noteworthy purchaser. In addition to owning another car, while on duty with the US Army in Germany in 1959 he bought a white 507 for US$3,500, a fortune at the time. He brought it back with him to the US, and at some point had the engine replaced with a 289-cubic inch Ford V-8. He gave the car to one of his most famous co-stars, the Swiss-born actress [[Ursula Andress]], in 1963. She kept it for some 20 years and, in 1997, it sold at an auction for US$350,000. Another famous owner is [[John Surtees]], who was given a 507 by [[MV Agusta]] (he still owns it). His series of engine upgrades yielding 194 hp became popular, and is known as the Surtees upgrade.

202 507s are known to survive, a tribute to the car's appeal. [[Bernie Ecclestone]]'s 507 fetched £430,238 ($904,000) at an [[auction]] in [[London]] in October 2007<ref>[http://www.classicrallies.com/blog/index.php?/archives/902-RM-auctions-first-London-sale-results.html Report of auction in classicrallies.com]</ref>. 2009 the prices for 507s have reached €900,000.

The styling of the 507 later influenced the [[BMW Z3|Z3]], [[BMW Z4|Z4]] and [[BMW Z8|Z8]].

==Design==
The 507 shared the frame of the 503, shortened from 2835 mm (111.6 in) to 2479 mm (97.6 in). Overall length was 4835 mm (172.6 in), and overall height was a low 1257 mm (49.5 in). Curb weight was about 1,485 kg (2,835 lb). The body was almost entirely hand-formed of [[aluminum]], and no two models were exactly the same. Many cars were sold with an optional hand-fabricated removable hardtop. Because of the car-to-car differences, each hardtop fits only the car for which it was made.

Front suspension was parallel [[double wishbone]]s, with [[torsion bar]] springs and an [[anti-roll bar]]. Rear suspension had a [[live axle]], also sprung by torsion bars, and located by a [[Panhard rod]] and a central, transverse [[A-arm]] to control acceleration and braking forces. Brakes were [[Alfin]] [[drum brake]]s of 284.5 mm (11.2 in) diameter, and [[power brakes]] were optional. Late-model 507s had front Girling [[disc brake]]s.

The engine was the [[aluminum]] [[alloy]] [[BMW OHV V8 engine|BMW OHV V8]], of 3.2 L (195.8 in³) displacement, with [[pushrod]]-operated overhead [[poppet valve|valves]]. It had two Solex [[Zenith Carburetters|Zenith]] 32NDIX two-barrel [[carburetor]]s. It rated 150 hp (111.9 kW) DIN, with 160 hp (119.4 kW) optional. It was mated to a four-speed [[manual transmission]] with various rear-end ratios optional. It was capable of 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in about 10 seconds; the factory claimed a top speed of 141 mph (227 km/h), depending on gearing.
