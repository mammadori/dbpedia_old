Launched in 1997, the '''Volkswagen Golf Mk4'''<ref>{{cite book |title=Deutsche Autos seit 1990, vol.5 |last=Kittler |first=Eberhard |year= 2001 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02128-5 |pages=290–302}}</ref> (or VW ''Typ 1J'') was the best selling car in [[Europe]] in 2001 (though it slipped to second place, behind the [[Peugeot 206]], in 2002).<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200221>{{cite journal| authorlink = Peter Frey (Bernd Ostmann - Ed)| title = Der böse Golf | journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = Heft 21 2002| page = Page 188 |date = date 2 October 2002}}</ref>  The Mk4 was a deliberate attempt to take the [[Volkswagen Golf]] series further upmarket, with a high-quality interior and higher equipment levels.  Overall the level of maturity of the design and its target audience were also evident &mdash; the humorous plays on the game of [[golf]] which resulted in special edition models of the three earlier generations being called "Golf Ryder", "Golf Driver", not to mention the GTI's "golf ball" gearlever knob were dropped, and replaced with a more subtly styled golf ball knob.It was replaced in 2004 by the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5]].

==Design and engineering==

As with the B5 Passat the year before, the Golf Mk4 was a significant car in its class.  As with its big brother, not only was it the first step of [[Volkswagen]] moving its products upmarket to plug a gap between the mainstream machines and the premium cars, with [[SEAT]] and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] taking over as the mainstream brands in the [[Volkswagen Group]]; it also brought in a new level of interior quality and sophistication never seen before from a mainstream brand in the class.  In fact, the quality of the Golf was on a par with its sister [[Audi A3]] from the year before, but cost considerably more than other cars in its class. 

The latest model remained faithful to the Golf concept but included some of the new "arched" styling themes first seen on the Mk4 Passat.

==Golf Cabriolet==
{{Main|Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet}}
[[Image:VW Golf III Cabrio white vr.jpg|thumb|left|2000 Golf Cabrio Facelift]] 

As with the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|Mk2 Golf]], Volkswagen did not make a convertible version of the Mk4 Golf.  Instead, the firm replaced the front and rear bumper bars of a [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3|Mk3 Golf]] and gave the car the Mk4 headlights and the grille to match.  This was done to give it the car the frontal styling of the Mk4 Golf hatchbacks.  The rear had its number plates moved into the bumper bar and a larger VW logo was incorporated over the Mk4's typical hatch handle.  The interior was also improved with "pixel" treatment to the dashboard, blue lighting for the instrument panel and more use of chrome, such as the door handles.

==Volkswagen Bora/Jetta Mk4==
{{Main|Volkswagen Jetta}}
Volkswagen spawned a saloon version of the Mk4 Golf.  As with previous incarnations of the Golf, it had its own identity, and this time was called the [[Volkswagen Bora]] although the name Jetta remained in North America and South Africa.  Unlike its predecessors, the Bora/Jetta featured unique rear doors, front wings and bonnet.  The front doors were the only body panels it shared with the Golf.  The interior, though, was almost identical to the Golf, featuring very minor styling changes like its predecessor.[[Image:VW Jetta sedan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Volkswagen Jetta]]

[[Germany]], [[South Africa]], [[Slovakia]], [[Brazil]], [[Belgium]], and [[China]] all made the Golf 4.  Eastern European locations making the Golf 4 included [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], in [[Vogošća]] (near [[Sarajevo]]), which also made [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Mk1]] and [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|Mk2]] models.  However, although the Bosnian Mk4 was popular it was only available in the local market.

The Golf/Jetta Mk4 engine choices included 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.3 [[Straight-4|I4]], 2.8 and 3.2 &nbsp;litre [[VR6]] petrol engines, and a 1.9&nbsp;litre turbodiesel, with power ranging from 68 to 150&nbsp;PS (50 to 110&nbsp;kW). 

Volkswagen made a choice of three and five-door hatchback or a five-door station wagon available.  The European Golf wagon was nearly identical to the North American Jetta Wagon.  The only difference was the use of the Golf front headlights, bumpers, grille, and fenders as these parts are interchangeable between the Mk4 Golf and Bora/Jetta. 

The Golf 4 was introduced to North America in mid-1999.  Available engines for the Golf at its introduction to the American market were a 2.0&nbsp;L gasoline engine, and a thrifty (48mpg) 1.9&nbsp;L [[Turbo Direct Injection|TDI]] engine.  The latter soon developed a reputation for good low-speed torque and fuel economy, and can operate on alternative biofuels.  In 2004 the updated 1.9L TDI PD or "Pumpe-Düse" engine was installed in the Golf and Jetta's.  The "Pumpe-Düse" or Pump Nozzle was a Robert Bosch extreme high pressure fuel injection system for direct cylinder injection.  A 1.8&nbsp;L turbocharged gas engine was introduced in 2000, along with the 12-valve 2.8&nbsp;L VR6. At the same time, the 1.6&nbsp;L 8-valve unit was replaced with the 16-valve unit from the [[Volkswagen Polo GTI|Polo GTI]], but detuned to 77&nbsp;kW (105 PS). The 2.0&nbsp;L gasoline engine was the base engine in the sportier GTI only as a 1999.5 model.  For 2000, Volkswagen opted for the relatively new 1.8&nbsp;L turbocharged gasoline engine as a base engine for the GTI.  The top-of-the-line GLX model was equipped with Volkswagen's torquey 2.8&nbsp;L [[VR6]], which put out an impressive {{Convert|174|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  The VR6 engine, with its narrow 15-degree Vee design, was unique to Volkswagen.  This engine is shorter and lighter (featuring a single cylinder head) than other [[V6]] engines which benefits the handling characteristics of this front-wheel drive car.  For the 2002.5 model year Volkswagen introduced a 24-valve version of its VR6 engine.  This engine had the same torque characteristics of the older 12-valve version, with an extra {{Convert|26|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  
The 1.8T and VR6 models continued until 2005, when the Mk4 platform came to an end.  

The Brazilian Golf TDI PD was sold in Canada due to its popularity as a full 2006 models in base, GL and GLS trim levels for the full model year as there were no diesel engine versions for the North American 2007 [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Mk5]] Golf (Rabbit). 

In Europe, trim levels were country-specific, although some markets got E, S, SE, GTI and V5/V6/V6 4MOTION versions.  The V5 was available in {{convert|150|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|170|bhp|abbr=on}} versions

==GTI 25th Anniversary Edition (2001)==
[[Image:VW GTI 337.jpg|Volkswagen GTI 337 Edition|thumb|right]]
The '''GTI 25th Anniversary Edition''' was a special version of the Golf GTI, for the [[European Economic Area|European Market]] to commemorate the first Golf model, launched in [[1976]]. At the time of its launch, it wasn't confirmed whether Volkswagen was going to sell this special edition model in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted by **TIME AGO** |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/buying_guide/volkswagen/gti/volkswagen_golf_gti_25th_anniversary_edition_short_take_road_test |title=Volkswagen Golf GTI 25th-Anniversary Edition - Short Take Road Test - Auto Reviews |publisher=Car and Driver |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref>

A year later, a similarly-equipped version of the GTI, called the '''GTI 337 Edition''', was officially introduced at the [[New York Auto Show]] and made it to dealers late May [[2002]] to the US & Canadian markets. The price of the GTI 337 was $22,225 in the U.S. and $32,900 in Canada.  Only 1,500 units were produced for the US market with an additional 250<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.vwvortex.com/zerothread?&id=1029415&postid=9696602#9696602 |title=VWvortex Forums: The "Official" DIY/FAQ 337/20th AE/Jetta GLI Thread |publisher=Forums.vwvortex.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref> for the Canadian market.  This model came painted exclusively in metallic Reflex Silver.

Both the GTI 25th anniversary and the 337 editions were equipped with many extra features not included in the standard GTI.  They included: 18x7.5" [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG|BBS]] RC Wheels with special ball peen finish, perforated leather shift boot and handbrake, red and black seat belts, Red and Black upholstered [[Recaro]] seats, factory body kit (front valance, sideskirts, hatch spoiler, and rear valance), 02M 6-speed [[manual transmission]], larger front and rear brakes, lowered sport tuned suspension, and brushed aluminum interior trim.  These models were never equipped with a [[sunroof]] as to take the car back to its roots, the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Mk1 GTI]], and improve handling and performance.

==GTI 20th Anniversary Edition (2003)==
[[Image:20th GTI PF.jpg|Volkswagen GTI 20th Anniversary Edition|thumb|right]]
[[Image:20th Interior.jpg|Volkswagen GTI 20th Anniversary Edition Interior|thumb|right]]
Following the initial commemorative anniversary edition GTI produced in Europe in 1996 celebrating the introduction of the GTI model in 1976, and the overwhelming popularity of the 25th anniversary edition GTI produced 2001 (known as the GTI 337 in North America when released in 2002), [[Volkswagen of America]] produced 4,200 so-branded "20th Anniversary Edition" GTIs and 4000 were shipped to the United States and 200 to Canada.  This event, in 2003, marked the 20th anniversary of the GTI's first introduction to the U.S. and Canadian market, some 7 years after the GTI was introduced to the European market.  Several special features distinguish this new GTI from the rest of the pack. 

On the outside, the 20th Anniversary edition came with throwback red-lettered GTI logos on the left front and right rear.  The rear was also accompanied by a vintage-look chrome rabbit.  Blackened headlights added a distinctive look, while Votex front, rear, and side skirts along with a hatch spoiler and special edition 18" OZ Aristo alloy wheels wrapped in [[Michelin]] Pilot Sports complete the exterior transformation.  These models were produced only in three colours: Imola Yellow, Jazz Blue and Black Magic Pearl.  Distribution of production was 50% Black magic pearl, 25% Jazz Blue and 25% Imola Yellow.

Inside, a few accents were noticeable.  Unlike other models, there were no options offered.  The only true option was [[Electronic stability control|ESP]], Volkswagen's stability control feature.  All "20ths" had a sunroof, black headliner, golf ball shift knob, black leather steering wheel with silver stitching, black leather shifter boot with silver stitching, preforated leather covered hand brake handle, and sporty black cloth [[Recaro]] bucket seats with silver stitching accents and red GTI emblems embroidered in the middle of the back rests.  Aluminum trim came standard, complete with a numbered nameplate above the center console identifying the exact production number (US production only) of the vehicle.  Volkswagen's premier 8-speaker [[Monsoon]] stereo system was also standard.

Mechanically, the 20th Anniversary Edition GTI is nearly identical to the GTI 337 Edition.  A 6-speed manual 02m transmission marked the most notable departure from the norm, and upgraded suspension stiffened up the ride and lowered the car approximately 30&nbsp;mm (lower sport springs and revised bushings in the rear).  Upgraded [[disc brake]]s front (12.3" vented rotors) and rear (10.3" vented rotors) helped bring things to a stop, while red powder-coated calipers added a bit of flair to the package.

Starting in 2002 with engine code AWP, all of the models of the GTI's 1.8T increased in factory boost pressure and [[horsepower]] from {{convert|150|bhp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|180|bhp|abbr=on}}.

==R32 (2002){{anchor|R32}}==
[[Image:VW Golf IV R32 20090916 front.jpg|R32|thumb|right]]
In 2002, Volkswagen produced the '''Golf R32''' in Europe as a 2003 [[model year]].  Due to unexpected popularity, Volkswagen of America decided to sell the car in the [[United States]] as the 2004 model year Volkswagen R32.  Billed as the pinnacle of the Golf IV platform, the R32 included every performance, safety, and luxury feature Volkswagen had to offer, including the all new 3.2&nbsp;[[litre]] [[multi-valve|24-valve]] [[VR6 engine]] (ID codes: BFH/BML), which produced a rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output of {{convert|177|kW|PS hp|0|lk=on}}, and {{Auto ft.lbf|236|0}} of [[torque]].  The North American variant of the R32 shared the same [[mass flow sensor]] (MAF) as the original [[Audi TT#8N|Audi TT 3.2]], which was slightly larger (¼") than the European spec R32's MAF.  Further additions included [[Haldex Traction]]-based [[4motion]] on-demand [[four-wheel drive]] system, a new six-speed [[manual transmission]], [[independent rear suspension]], [[Climatronic]] automatic climate control, sport seats from König with R32 logos, 18" OZ Aristo [[alloy wheel]]s (Ronal produced the wheels towards the end of production), [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]], larger {{convert|334|mm|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[disc brake]]s with gloss blue painted calipers, [[sunroof]], and model specific bodywork additions.

In the US, the vehicle was available in only four colours: Black Magic Pearl, Deep Blue Pearl, Reflex Silver, and Tornado Red. The distribution of US-spec R32 colours were as follows:{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}<br />
Deep Blue Pearl: 40%<br />
Reflex Silver: 35%<br />
Black Magic Pearl: 15%<br />
Tornado Red: 10%

Although the R32 shared a similar appearance with the 25th Anniversary GTI, the R32 shared the vast majority of its major components with the 3.2&nbsp;litre [[Audi TT]], most notably, the engine, [[four-wheel drive]] system, and both front and rear suspension geometries.  Five thousand cars were produced and intended to be sold over a two-year period, but the entire line was sold out within 13 months.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The R32 is the second quickest car that Volkswagen has imported to the U.S., after the B6 Passat 3.6 4motion Sedan - at 5.6 seconds.  The R32 is capable of 0-{{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in 6.6&nbsp;seconds, and clearing the quarter mile in 14.1 seconds at {{convert|99.2|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}  The R32 edges out its third fastest sibling, the top-of-the-line Phaeton 6.0 litre W12 (414&nbsp;bhp), by a tenth of a second at the {{convert|1320|ft|m|0|sing=on}} mark.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

It also has a surprisingly high resale and used-car value; the [[Kelley Blue Book]] used car retail price (the price an individual might expect to pay for one from a dealer) for a model in excellent condition with low mileage actually exceeds the original retail price of the car in many cases, making it one of a few recent cars that have actually approached an increase in value over time.  This premium can be explained mostly due to scarcity, both of the cars themselves due to low production and importation, and especially ones that still have extremely low mileage.

==Mk4 "City Golf (Golf City in 2009)" in Canada, South America & Bora HS in China==
[[Image:Volkswagen City Golf.jpg|thumb|right|2008-present Volkswagen City Golf (Canada)]]
In China, [[Volkswagen Group China|FAW-VW]] launched a new Golf IV, with [[Volkswagen Group China|FAW-VW's]] Bora facelift front, at the Beijing International Automobile Exhibition in 2006.  It is named Bora HS to compliment the Bora Mk IV range, as the Golf name will be reserved for the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6|Golf VI]] soon to manufactured by [[Volkswagen Group China|FAW-VW]] in Q3, 2009.

The Golf Mk4 also continues to be sold in countries like Brazil and Argentina. However, in Argentina the range is available on 1.6L 4 cylinder petrol, a 2.0L [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] petrol, 1.8L Turbo petrol, or a 1.9-[[litre]] {{convert|130|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} turbodiesel. In [[Chile]], it is also sold, on 1.6 to 2.0L petrol range.  Also, there is a turbo 1.8 version available.  All of these are 4-cylinder petrol engines.

In [[Brazil]], the Mk4 Golf has a 1.6 (with Volkswagen Totalflex system which accepts both gasoline or alcohol), 1.8 Turbocharged engine and 2.0-litre engine, and comes in many trim level only.

In 2007, Volkswagen [[Brazil]] has introduced a major restyling of the fourth generation Golf. The front takes styling cues from the current [[Volkswagen Polo]] and the back of the car is inspired by the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf 5]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motor-show.com.ar/2007/04/13/nuevo-vw-golf-en-brasil-generacion-iv-y-medio/ |title=Nuevo VW Golf en Brasil: Generación IV “y medio” |publisher=MotorShow |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref> It is exported in most Latin America countries, since it is produced in Brazil. It is also sold in Canada, where it is sold alongside the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Mk5]] model badged as the Rabbit. The Canadian model was renamed as the '''City Golf''', in 2009 it was renamed the Golf City alongside the Jetta City.It is not sold in the [[United States]]. Pricing of the Golf City starts at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]15,300 as of 2008.  As an entry-level alternative to the Rabbit, it offers only one engine: the 2.0L [[SOHC]] 8 valves with {{Convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It is not related to the South African [[Volkswagen Citi]]Golf, despite the similarity in name. The Mk4 Jetta has been similarly reintroduced in Canada for the 2007 model year as the City Jetta.  This is the first entry-level car from a previous-generation car since the 1992 [[Eagle Vista]], which was a rebadged 1980s [[Mitsubishi Mirage]]. Althought the Golf City is dated, its attractive price enables good sales. The Golf City will continue to sell until 2010 while the Jetta City is going through its last model year.

==Notes==
{{trivia|date=September 2009}}
*In 1999, Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], prefect of the Catholic Church's Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith under [[Pope John Paul II]], purchased a fourth-generation Golf to drive around Rome in, and sold it in 2005 after John Paul's death in anticipation of retiring and returning to Germany.  Instead, he became [[Pope Benedict XVI]].  His 1999 Golf sold for nearly a quarter of a million U.S. dollars shortly thereafter.<ref>[http://vwgolf.pl/source/historia/ratzinger_golf_mk4_2.jpg Photo of Ratzinger's Golf Brief]</ref>
