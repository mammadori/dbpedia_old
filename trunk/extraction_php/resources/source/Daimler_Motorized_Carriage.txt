<!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Image:1887 Daimler motorized handcar.jpg]] -->In [[1890]], German engineers [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] founded [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG). The company was founded with Maybach as chief designer. Its purpose was the construction of small, high-speed engines for use in land, water, and air transport. They sold their first automobile in [[1892]], the '''Daimler Motorized Carriage'''.

From 1872, Maybach and Daimler often worked as engineers in other companies at the same time, designing [[engines]] and accessories to engines for these companies. Finally, they worked together on the staff of the engine manufacturer, the [[Deutz AG|Deutz-AG-Gasmotorenfabrik]] in [[Cologne]] that was half-owned by [[Nikolaus Otto|Nikolaus August Otto]]. In 1880 Daimler was fired by Otto and Mayback soon quit, whereupon, they began working as partners.

Unknown to Otto, Daimler, and Maybach, during 1878 [[Karl Benz]], in [[Mannheim]], was concentrating all his efforts on creating a reliable two-stroke gas engine. Benz finished his engine on December 31, 1878, New Year's Eve, and was granted a [[patent]] for his engine in 1879 and along with the design and sale of static engines, he began to design a vehicle that could be motorized.

Maybach and Daimler built the ''Standuhr Engine'' (''Grandfather Clock'' engine) in 1885. Their engine was adapted to a [[bicycle]] and tested on the road, becoming the first [[motorcycle]]. Later, their engine also was adapted to boats and a stagecoach. A stagecoach adapted with an engine, a precursor to an automobile that would be built by these two working together was first shown to public in November 1886, being begun three months after the [[Benz Patent Motorwagen|Benz Motorwagon]] was awarded the patent as the first true [[automobile]], that Benz had built and tested in [[1885]].

The precursor built by Daimler and Maybach is not classified as an automobile, however, since it was a [[stagecoach]], a horse-drawn carriage purchased from another manufacturer, which they adapted by putting an engine onto it to move two of the wheels. In contrast, the Benz Patent Motorwagen had a chassis that was designed from the beginning as an [[Completeness|integral]] part of a vehicle that would be motorized, therefore making the vehicle qualify for a [[patent]] as an [[invention]].

The Daimler-Maybach ''Standuhr'' engine soon was adapted for use in a boat they named ''Nector'' and in [[1889]], Daimler and Maybach built their first automobile that did not involve adapting a horse drawn carriage or stagecoach with their engine. This was before they formed the DMG company. There was no production in Germany, but the engine was licensed to be built in France and presented to the public in Paris in October 1889 by both inventors. The same year, Daimler's wife, Emma Kunz, died.

In 1890, they founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) and they sold their first automobile in [[1892]]. Daimler fell ill and took a break from working at the company. Upon his return, he experienced difficulty with the other stock holders that led to his resignation in 1893.  Soon Maybach resigned also. Rights to use the Daimler name were sold as well. Both returned to DMG in 1894. In 1900 Daimler died and Maybach quit DMG in 1907, establishing his own business.
