'''Audi S and RS models''' are a range of [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] [[automobile|cars]], of certain Audi [[car model|model ranges]], from the [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry|automotive company]], Audi AG.  These cars are [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM) factory "[[upgrade]]d" versions of specific cars, from within [[Audi]]'s standard range of vehicles, primarily focusing in enhanced "[[sports car|sport]]" [[action (philosophy)|performance]].<ref name="Quattro25">Audi of America Press Site [http://media.audiusa.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=9540 25 Years of Audi Quattro] 22 February 2005</ref>

==S models{{anchor|S}}==
[[Image:S4 front.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the "S" vertical emphasis lines on the front grille of a [[Audi S4#B6|B6 S4]]]]
Numerous "'''S'''" models, from most of Audi's mainstream [[car model|model ranges]] have been produced over the years.  These [[automobile|cars]] are recognisable by their "S<big>'''*'''</big>" [[badge]]s, and vertical emphasis lines on their front grilles.

All Audi "S" models are equipped with Audi's 'trademark' [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] [[four-wheel drive]] system as standard.<ref name="Quattro25"/>  Unique [[internal combustion engine]]s, along with larger, more powerful [[brake]]s, stiffer [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension systems]], additional exterior body styling, and [[carbon fiber|carbon fibre]] interior trims set them apart from their related "siblings" of their respective model range.

Audi "S" models should not be confused with the lesser Audi "'''[[quattro GmbH#S line|S&nbsp;line]]'''" models, which are merely a trim/specification level, similar to say "SE", and which will share identical engines and brakes with the "lesser" [[trim package|trim specifications]] within their relevant model range.{{-}}

==RS models{{anchor|RS}}==
[[quattro GmbH]], Audi AGs high performance private subsidiary, creates even [[high performance vehicle|higher performance versions]], known by their '''"[[quattro GmbH#RS cars|RS]]"''' badging.  The '''"RS"''' initials are taken from the {{lang-de|'''R'''enn'''S'''port}} - literally translated to "racing sport", but its actual meaning is ''"motor sport"''.  RS is Audi's highest performance 'top-tier' trim level, positioned distinctly above the '''"[[Audi S and RS models#S models|S]]"''' ("Sport") specification level of Audi's regular model range.  

Audi RS cars are some of the most [[motive power|powerful]] vehicles ever offered by Audi.  The [[Audi RS6#C6|Audi RS6 5.0 TFSI quattro]], for instance, is more powerful than the [[Audi S8#D3|Audi S8 5.2 FSI quattro]].<ref name="Quattro25"/>

Available for limited [[time scale]]s, on a restricted [[car model|model range]], these '''"RS"''' models are wholly [[automotive design|designed]], [[research and development|developed]] and [[automotive engineering|produced]] in-house by [[Audi|Audi AG's]] high performance private subsidiary company, [[quattro GmbH]], at its [[Neckarsulm]] [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|factory]],<ref>[http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/about_audi_ag/investor_relations/for_investors/participations/quattro_gmbh.html quattro GmbH] - Investor Relations for Audi AG</ref> and usually have a wider [[monocoque#automobiles|bodyshell]] (sometimes informally referred to as 'widebody') to allow for a wider front- and rear-[[axle track]].

All "RS" cars [[innovation|pioneer]] some of Audi's latest and most advanced [[technology]] and [[engineering]] prowess, therefore, "RS" cars could be described as "halo vehicles".

There is usually only one RS model in production at a time.

==Model range==
The following [[Audi]] "S" and "RS" [[high performance vehicle|high performance models]] are being, or have been [[automotive engineering|produced]], or are speculated to be in future production:

==Audi S&nbsp;line{{anchor|S line}}==
[[Image:Audi S-line.JPG|left|200px|thumb|"S&nbsp;line" badge in front [[grille]]]]
Audi produce a specification of optional sports [[trim package]]s to their mainstream models, known as the '''S&nbsp;line'''.  This is merely a trim specification which allows customers to effect a sporty appearance in their mainstream Audi model.  Whilst the specific S&nbsp;line trim parts are designed and produced by [[quattro GmbH]] at its [[Neckarsulm]] factory, these mainstream cars are still assembled by [[Audi AG]] at their relevant factories on the same [[production line]]s alongside their other standard models.

Cars with S&nbsp;line trim are not to be confused with [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] S models (made by Audi AG) and RS models (made by [[quattro GmbH]]); Audi cars with S&nbsp;line trim bear identical performance figures to their counterparts with base or SE trim levels.{{-}}
