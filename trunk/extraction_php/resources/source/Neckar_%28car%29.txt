'''Neckar''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[automobile]] manufacturer from 1957 to 1971, which produced [[Fiat]] and [[Autobianchi]] vehicles under license in [[Heilbronn]].

== History ==

[[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] had sold its [[Heilbronn]] factory (near the river [[Neckar]]) in 1929 to [[Fiat]] due to the [[Great Depression|economic crisis]]. Fiat started to produce under license [[Fiat Topolino]]s and Balillas in this factory under the brand [[NSU-Fiat]] (at the same time, the same cars were produced under license in France by [[Simca|SIMCA-Fiat]]).

In 1957, NSU decided to restart the production of personnel cars, and asked to this Fiat licensee to change its name, and therefore NSU-Fiat became '''Neckar'''. Neckar was producing less than 25,000 vehicles a year, [[Fiat 500]] (Neckar Weinsberg), [[Fiat 600|600]] (Neckar Jagst) and [[Fiat 1100|1100]] (Neckar Europa) slightly modified, often more luxurious and sporty than the Fiat produced in [[Turin]].
    
The launch of the [[Fiat 1300/1500|Fiat 1500]] in 1961 and of the Neckar Panorama (derived from the [[Autobianchi]] [[Autobianchi Bianchina|Panoramica]]) allowed Neckar to reach a yearly production of 50,000 units in 1962. A nice coupe derived from the 1500 and called the Neckar Mistral was designed. A coupe and a convertible based on the Fiat 600 was produced as the Neckar Riviera. The [[Fiat 850]] (as the Neckar Adria) was the last model produced by Neckar.

The high cost of the German workforce (compared to the Italian one) doomed Neckar. Fiat refused to sell the license of the new [[Fiat 124]], [[Fiat 125|125]] and [[Fiat 128|128]] to Neckar. Production of Neckar slowed down from 1963. 50,000 cars were produced in 1962, down to 44,000 units in 1963, 22,000 in 1964, 18,000 in 1967 and 12,000 in 1970. Neckar closed in 1971 having produced 370,000 cars in total.
