The original [[Volkswagen Beetle]] has developed in time as one of the most popular cars in the world to restore. The simplicity of design by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] has made working on this car very easy. The body, wiring loom and simple engine are very straightforward to work on. In addition, the relatively minor changes made to the shape and design of the car makes interchanging parts possible. There is a rich source of new parts available for the Volkswagen Beetle, making it an ever popular vehicle for [[car restoration]]. 

A more detailed description of restoration, along with interior and exterior shots can be found at bugme.co.uk [http://www.bugme.co.uk]. Often, parts are upgraded to make them safer, such as the conversion from [[drum brakes]] to more efficient [[disc brake]] set ups.
