The '''Porsche 906''' or '''Carrera 6''' was the last street-legal racing car from [[Porsche]]. 65 were produced in 1966.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} This allowed the model to be homologated for racing in the FIA's new [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] Sports Car category although the type would also compete in modified form in the Group 6 Sports Prototype class.

A successor to the [[Porsche 904]], and designed under [[Ferdinand Piëch]]'s new regime at Porsche R&D, the 906 replaced the boxed [[steel]] structure of the 904 which used the fiberglass body for extra structural strength with a tubular [[space frame]] and unstressed [[fiberglass]] body. The fiberglass itself was laid up by hand, producing consistent results, instead of the uneven spraying technique used on the 904.

The result was a car that weighed {{convert|580|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, approximately 250 lb (113&nbsp;kg) lighter than the 904/6 (the 6-cylinder 904). The engine regularly fitted was the 901/20 6-cylinder lightweight racing engine with 220 hp and carburetors, although some examples that were raced by the factory team received fuel injected or 8-cylinder engines, especially in [[hillclimbing]] events where Porsche competed with [[Ferrari Dino]]s for the European championship.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Unlike previous racing Porsches, the 906's body was tested in a [[wind tunnel]], resulting in a top speed of {{convert|280|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} at Le Mans, quite fast for a 2-liter engine car. It shows already a close resemblance to future Porsche racing cars. As in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]], [[Gull-wing doors]] were fitted, and the engine at the rear was covered with a large plexiglas cover.

In its debut in the 1966 [[24 Hours of Daytona]], the Carrera 6 finished 6th overall, and won its class against Ferrari Dino 206 Ps. At the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], [[Hans Herrmann]]/[[Gerhard Mitter]] finished fourth overall and won the class, as at the 1000&nbsp;km of [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]].

The 1000&nbsp;km at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]] were disappointing, as were the 1000&nbsp;km [[Nürburgring]] where the Dinos were only beaten by the [[Chevrolet]]-V8-powered [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]]. A privately entered 906 secured an overall victory at the 1966 [[Targa Florio]] when the factory cars failed.

At the 1966 [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the 906 placed 4-5-6-7 behind three [[Ford GT40]] Mk IIs, outlasting all of the previously dominant V12 engined [[Ferrari P]]s.

In order to save money, spare suspensions produced in advance for a possible new series of Porsche 904 had to be used for the 906, along with big 15 inch wheels. Yet, [[Formula One]] used lighter 13 inch wheels, and Porsche had already used [[Team Lotus]] suspension parts in earlier years. The wheels were bolted on with 5 nuts as in a road car, which cost time in pitstops compared to a single central nut.

To take advantage of the lighter wheels and F1 tyres, the [[Porsche 910]] was developed and entered in mid-season of 1966, starting with the hillclimb from [[Sierre]] to [[Crans-Montana]] in Switzerland.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Media Appearances==

A white Porsche 906 played a prominent role in ''Florence Italy'', a [[1986]] episode of [[Miami Vice]], racing with [[Sonny Crockett|Sonny Crockett's]] [[Ferrari Daytona]] through the streets of [[Miami]].

The 906 is an unlockable car in the racing simulator [[GT Legends]]. It is also drivable in both the 1970 World Sports Car Championship and Historic GT & Touring cars mods for [[Rfactor]].
