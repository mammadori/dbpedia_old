The origins of the first Audi 100 have become legendary in Germany.   When Volkswagen purchased [[Auto Union]] from [[Mercedes Benz]] in 1965, they seem to have been motivated by a desperate shortage of production capacity for their [[Volkswagen Type 1|’Beetle’]] model which at that time was selling faster than the cars could be produced.   The then nearly new Auto Union plant at [[Ingolstadt]], built under Mercedes ownership and control, was quickly adapted for Beetle assembly: Volkswagen boss [[Heinrich Nordhoff]], mindful of the poor sales record of the [[DKW F102]], and at a time when the new [[Audi 75|Audi F103]] had yet to prove itself in the market place, gave instructions that no further new Auto Union (including Audi) models should be developed.

However, it was not just the Ingolstadt manufacturing facility that Volkswagen acquired from Mercedes when they purchased the Auto Union business.   Among the employees inherited from the Mercedes era was engineer [[:de:Ludwig Kraus|Ludwig Kraus]].   Kraus did not share Nordhoff’s apparent conviction that demand for the Beetle would remain insatiable forever, and it was Kraus who developed the Audi 100, in direct contravention of instructions from Volkswagen management, and in secret.   The first Nordhoff knew of the project was when he was presented with a production ready prototype.   It is to Nordhoff’s credit that he changed his mind and gave the car the green light.   The Audi 100 would be a commercial success, but it would also be the first of a series of front engined water cooled Audi based designs from the Volkswagen group that would, starting with the first [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] in 1973, enable the group to survive and flourish once the European and US markets began to lose their appetites for rear engined air cooled models.

The Audi 100 was shown to the press on 26 November 1968.  Its name originally denoting a power output of {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, the Audi 100 was the company's largest car since the revivial of the Audi brand by Volkswagen in 1965.  The C1 platform spawned several variants: the Audi 100 two- and four-door saloons, and the '''Audi 100 Coupé S''', a stylish [[fastback]] coupé, which bore a remarkable resemblance to the Aston Martin DBS released a year earlier, especially at the rear end, including details such as the louvres behind the rear side windows and shape of the rear light clusters.

Audi followed up the introduction of the four-door saloon in November 1968 with a two-door saloon in October 1969 and the 100 Coupé S in autumn 1970.  The cars' [[Straight-4|four-cylinder engines]] originally came in base (100, {{convert|80|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}), 100 S (1.8 litre, {{convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}) and 100 LS (1.8 litre, {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}) guise, while the Coupé was driven by a bored-out 1.9 litre developing {{convert|115|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.  From April 1970 the 100 LS could be ordered with a 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] sourced from [[Volkswagen]].

Starting with model year 1972 the 80 and 90 PS versions were replaced by a new regular-petrol-variant of the 1.8 litre engine developing 85 PS (84 hp/63&nbsp;kW); at the same time, the 100 GL was introduced that featured the 1.9 liter engine formerly used in the Coupé S only.

In March 1971 the 500,000th Audi was produced.  By now the Audi 100 had become the most commercially successful model in the company's history, so it is unsurprising that the car in question was an Audi 100 produced at the [[Ingolstadt]] plant.   <ref name=Autocar1971>{{cite journal| authorlink = | title = News and Views| journal = [[Autocar]]| volume = vol 134 (nbr 3914)| pages = page 31|date = date 1 April 1971}}</ref>  

In September 1973 the 100 received a minor facelift with a somewhat smaller grille and reshuffled taillight lens patterns. The rear torsion bar was replaced by coil springs.

For model year 1975 the base 100 was re-christened the 100 L and received a 1.6 litre four cylinder engine (coming out of the [[Audi 80]]).

The C2 Audi 100 was launched in 1976, with crisper styling and an unusual five-cylinder engine (the first gasoline 5 in the world &mdash; [[Mercedes-Benz]] had shown the way in 1974 with their three litre diesel 5-cyl in the [[Mercedes-Benz C111]]).  It was initially a {{convert|100|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine offering "6-cylinder power and 4-cylinder economy", and later upgraded to {{convert|136|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

The Coupé was discontinued, but a five-door [[hatchback]] model, the '''100 Avant''', was launched in August 1977 as part of this generation.  The mainstay of the range remained the four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] model.   A two-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] version was offered, primarily on the domestic market, from 1977, but by now there was little demand, even in Germany, for large two door sedans: few of these two door Audi 100 C2s were sold.

At the end of September 1977, the Audi 100 became the manufacturer's first model to reach a production level of 1,000,000 units<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197721>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ferdinand Simoneit  (Ed)| title =Jubiläum bei Ausi in Neckarsulm| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = 1977 Heft 21| pages = Seite 7|date = date 12 October 1977}}</ref>.   The millionth Audi 100 was a hatchback '''Audi 100 Avant''' assembled not at the company's main [[Ingolstadt]] plant but to the west, at the [[Neckarsulm]] factory which, since the demise of the mainstream volume models from the [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] range, had been concentrating on providing additional production capacity for the fast selling Audi range<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197721/>.

'''Right Hand Drive Audi 200 5E and 5T (type 43)'''

The RHD Audi 200 5E and 5T were introduced into the UK in 1979, only 500 were imported. The 5T (170 PS) was a higher spec Turbo version of the 5E (136 PS injection) and came with many optional extras as standard. As an attempt to lure British buyers the UK version of the 5T had opening quarter lights, electric wing mirrors, a sun roof, cruise control and heated seats. All Type 43 200's came with Automatic gearboxes, a 5 speed manual was special order only.

Edging out the [[Ford Sierra]] as [[Car of the Year]] in Europe, the 1983 '''Audi 100''' had a remarkable [[aerodynamic]] look, achieving a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.30 for its smoothest base model.   The increased aerodynamic efficiency resulted in better fuel economy and consumers all over the world were waking up to this fact.  This became a great marketing tool for Audi in the 1980s, and marked a huge leap forward from the boxy shape of the C2, as well as the technology it introduced, including the [[procon-ten]] safety system.

Audi was able to follow up on the modern smooth look first seen in this segment on the 1967 [[NSU Ro 80]] and popularized by the 1974 [[Citroën CX]]. The Audi in turn influenced the [[Ford Taurus]], an American-made sedan from 1986.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}  This rounded look became the norm by the 1990s.  It also set a styling trend of flush wheel covers, a thick black side door moulding and blacked out window frames eventually adopted by a range of cars from the 1984 [[Honda Accord]] to the [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K cars]].  Audi innovated flush windows on the C3, a key area for aerodynamic [[drag (physics)|drag]] that has been adopted by virtually all manufacturers today.

The two-door models were no longer available, and the Audi 100 Avant was reintroduced as Audi's first attempt at a [[station wagon]] based on the 100.  The 200 continued as the upmarket variant with several versions of the 2.2&nbsp;L turbo 5-cylinder available in different markets over its life ranging in power outputs from {{convert|165|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} MC engine, through the {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} versions to the final {{convert|220|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 20-valve 3B engine available from 1990.  The 200 20V was distinguished by its flared front and rounded rear wheel arches instead of the flat type used for the rest of the 100-200 range.  The MC turbo engine was available in the 100 as well for some markets.

The 100 also featured a 2.5&nbsp;L straight-5 direct injection turbo-diesel (TDI) model with {{convert|120|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} introduced in 1990 (engine code 1T). A such-engined Audi 100 was the very first model to wear the now ubiquitous and hugely successful TDI label that changed the perception of diesel engines all over the world.

In the United States, the 5000 name was abandoned after Audi received very negative publicity over its "unintended acceleration" incident, a problem exacerbated by a November 1986 [[CBS News]]' ''[[60 Minutes]]'' program.<ref>Civil Justice Memo, No. 18 January 1990 [http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjm_18.htm Manufacturing the Audi Scare]</ref><ref>Accuracy in Media [http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/the-cbs-cold-case-files/ The CBS “Cold Case” Files]</ref>  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases, including all the ones that prompted the ''60 Minutes'' report, were caused by driver error such as confusion of pedals.<ref>HighBeam Research, Inc. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1185635.html Unfair at Any Speed]</ref>  [[CBS]] issued a partial retraction.  A legacy of this are the intricate patterns many [[gear stick|shifter]]s use, and brake [[interlock]] mechanisms to prevent inadvertent shifting into forward or reverse, where the standard was a straight front-back pattern.

However, with the damage to its US reputation done, the 5000 once again became the 100, or the 200 depending on engine configuration, for the 1989 model year.  Audi sales in the US would not return to the same level for 15 years.  During its last year of production for the 1991 model year, the 100 and 200 featured a larger, more rounded rear wheel-well opening.  This minor styling revision was something of preview of the styling of the upcoming fourth generation model that was waiting in the wings and, in appearance, further dissociated the model from that of the 5000 with its damaged reputation.

The engine range comprised the following engines:<ref>Oswald, op. cit., p. 319-329.</ref><ref>Covello, op. cit., p. 85-89.</ref>

As of late 1988, the '''[[Audi V8]]''' was available.  Although styling was similar to the 200, the V8 had different chassis and body.  The V8 was available as a 3.6&nbsp;L or a 4.2&nbsp;L engine.  It was the first [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] model to have an automatic gearbox, featuring a ZF 4-speed unit with an electronically controlled multiplate clutch centre differential, combined with a [[Torsen]] rear differential.  The [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox quattro's across the range continued with a conventional rear differential (lockable at low speeds), and the Torsen centre differential (manual transmission V8 quattros had Torsen differentials in both the centre and the rear).
The 5000 ''S/Turbo'' was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'s'' [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1984 and 1985.  The ''CS Turbo quattro'' was on that list for 1986 through 1988.

{{see also|Audi A6#C4}}
A heavily revised C3, the C4, was introduced in 1991.  The C3-platform Audi V8 continued to be sold as a separate line.  The major change for the C4 was the introduction of a 2.8&nbsp;L, 90-degree, SOHC 12v, [[V6]] engine.  It was later joined by a 2.6&nbspL variant, though this is actually a 60-degree engine.  They are essentially the same engines offered in the 1992, B4 [[Audi 80]].  The option of [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent four wheel drive was an option across the range, and the Audi 100 quattro was available with a ZF 4-speed automatic gearbox.

For the 1995 model year, Audi dropped the Audi 100 name, renaming it the [[Audi A6|A6]] instead.  In addition, the existing 100-derived [[Audi S4]] became the [[Audi S6|S6]]. The S4 name was later re-used for the high-performance derivative of the [[Audi A4]]. The Audi V8 was eventually replaced by the [[Audi A8|A8]] in 1994.

The C4-based A6 continued until early 1997, when it was replaced by an all-new [[Audi A6|A6]].

==Type numbers==
In addition to the C platform codes, Audi assigned type numbers to their models:
* '''F104''': C1; Audi 100 (1968&ndash;1976)
* '''Type 43''': C2; Audi 100 (1976&ndash;1982); Audi 200 (1979&ndash;1982)
* '''Type 44''': C3; Audi 100 (1983&ndash;1991); Audi 200 (1983&ndash;1992)
* '''Type 4A''': C4; Audi 100 (1991&ndash;1994); Audi S4 (1992&ndash;1994); Audi A6 (1995&ndash;1997); Audi S6 (1995&ndash;1997)

==Chinese production==
[[Image:Hongqi.jpg|thumb|right|An example of [[Hongqi CA7200]], seen in [[Shanghai]]]]
The C3-platform Audi 100 was also produced in [[Changchun]], [[China]], by [[First Automobile Works|FAW]] (First Automobile Works, a Chinese automotive manufacturer), for many years during the 1990s.  Since most products are for governmental usage, all of China-made 100s are front-wheel drive sedans with a 2.0&nbsp;L 4 cylinder engine or a 2.3&nbsp;L 5 cylinder one.

In 1990, [[Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC]] approved a resolution to circumscribe car import and the [[engine displacement]] of cars equipped to officials.  Furthermore, the resolution also prescribed that all cars of central departments of both Party and government must be homemade ones.  As the most luxurious and advanced cars made in China in early-1990s, FAW-Audi 100 and 200 have possessed a considerable percentage in Chinese high-class market of executive cars for nearly one decade, until the C3-platform cars was replaced by [[Audi A6]] in 1999.

During the negotiation between FAW and Volkswagen in late-1980s, Volkswagen acceded to FAW's suggestion of combining the C3 platform with previously introduced [[Chrysler]] engines in the new generation [[Hongqi]] (Red Flag).  Hongqi CA7200 series with the technology of C3 were launched in mid-1990s, while most of C3 Audi 100 parts could be made in China.  CA7200 were initially equipped with Chrysler 2.0&nbsp;L or 2.2&nbsp;L 4 cylinder 488 engines, whose product line was introduced into China in 1987. In 2000s, new [[Nissan]] VQ20 engines replaced the original 4 cylinder petrol engine. [http://www.chinacartimes.com/2006/11/23/the-faw-is-over-for-red-flag/]

A small number of C3 200s (with 1.8T or 2.6 V6 engine) and some early C4 100s (largely in [[Europe]]an style but with tail lights in [[United States|American]] style) were also assembled in Changchun.

==Audi Duo==
{{main|Audi hybrid vehicles}}
At the Geneva Motor Show in March 1990<ref>Eberhard Kittler: ''Deutsche Autos seit 1990'', Bd. 5 ("German Cars since 1990, vol. 5"). Motorbuch Verlag, Stuttgart 2001, ISBN 3-613-02052-1, p.65</ref> Audi presented its first [[wikt:iteration|iteration]] of the [[Audi Duo]] (or Audi 100 Avant Duo) experimental vehicle, a [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in parallel hybrid]] based on the Audi 100 Avant quattro.  This car had a 12.6 [[Horsepower#Brake horsepower (bhp)|bhp]] [[Siemens]] [[electric motor]] which drove the rear wheels.  A [[Trunk (automobile)|trunk]]-mounted [[nickel-cadmium battery]] supplied [[energy]] to the motor that drove the rear wheels.  The vehicle's front wheels were powered by a 2.3-litre five-cylinder engine with an output of {{convert|136|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.  The intent was to produce a vehicle which could operate on the engine in the country and electric mode in the city. Mode of operation could be selected by the driver.  Just ten vehicles are believed to have been made; one [[drawback]] was that due to the extra weight of the electric drive, the vehicles were less efficient when running on their engines alone than standard Audi 100s with the same engine.

In late 1991,<ref>Eberhard Kittler: ''Deutsche Autos seit 1990'', Bd. 5 ("German Cars since 1990, vol. 5"). Motorbuch Verlag, Stuttgart 2001, ISBN 3-613-02052-1, p.71</ref> Audi unveiled the second Duo generation - likewise based on the Audi 100 Avant quattro.  Once again this featured an electric motor, a {{convert|28.6|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} three-phase machine, driving the rear wheels.  This time, however, the rear wheels were additionally powered via the [[Torsen]] [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] from the main engine compartment, which housed a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine.
