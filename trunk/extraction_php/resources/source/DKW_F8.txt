The '''IFA F8''' was the [[East German]] version of DKW F8 produced in former [[Auto Union|Auto Union AG]]'s [[Zwickau]] factory after it came under [[Soviet Union]] control. The factory and operation was reorganized as a [[Volkseigener Betrieb]] (or "People Owned Enterprise") [[Automobilwerke Zwickau]] (AWZ).

The DKW F8 [[compact car|compact]] [[front wheel drive]] [[two stroke]] engined [[automobile|saloon]] was introduced by  in 1939. The F8 was slightly shorter than its predecessor despite having a marginally increased wheelbase.   The base model, known as the Reichsklasse, was manufactured only till 1940 but the Meisterklasse sedan continued in production till 1942.   In addition to the saloons,  [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] (saloon ''and'' coupé) versions were offered.

After the [[Second World War|war]] the car reappeared in 1949 as the [[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau|'''IFA F8''']], from the [[Zwickau]] plant operated under [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet]] control. It continued in production until approximately 1955:  in  addition to the sedan and cabriolet bodies, various additional body types available post war included a [[panel van|delivery van]] and estate variant.

==Engine options==
The base ‘Reichsklasse’ model had the two stroke twin cylinder engine from its [[DKW F7|predecessor]], but fractionally bored out.   Engine capacity was  now 589 cc.  Claimed output and top speed were as before at  and 18 bhp (13.2 kW) and 80&nbsp;km/h (50 mph).

The ‘Meisterklasse’’ version of the DKW F8 also inherited its [[DKW F7|predecessor’s]] similarly configured engine of  692 cc. For this engine 20 bhp (14.7 kW) was claimed with a top speed of 85&nbsp;km/h (53 mph).   It was this larger engine that reappeared in the IFA F8 in 1949.

Power was delivered to the front wheels by means of a three speed manual gear box with a lockable [[Freewheel|freewheel mechanism]] on all three ratios.   The engine was started using a [[Dynastart]] device, which was a combination self starter / alternator<ref name="ifa.com">{{Citeweb|url= http://www.ifa-f8.de/|title=Technical specifications of IFA F8|accessdate=2008-03-02|work=ifa.com}}</ref>.

==The body==
The body was mounted on a box frame chassis which facilitated the fitting of different body options, such as the light vans and trucks produced during the IFA period.   The outer skin of the car comprised a combination of steel panels and, for the central portion, fabric covered timber frame bodywork.  After 1953 key panels were made from [[duroplast]], reducing the weight of the car and anticipating the light weight technologies that would be applied to [[Trabant]] construction.

==Model life==
The F8 had replaced the [[DKW F7]] after only a two year model life.   The small DKWs were among the best selling small cars in [[Germany]] during the 1930s, and regular model replacement was part of [[Auto Union|Auto Union's]] successful marketing strategy.  It seems that the F8 was itself scheduled for relatively rapid replacement by the steel bodied [[DKW F9]].   War intervened, however, and production of the Reichsklasse and Cabriolet was ended in 1940.   Production of the Meisterklasse continued till 1942.   By 1942, when passenger car production at Zwickau was ended, approximately 50,000 F8s had been produced.

At the 1947 [[Leipzig Trade Fair|Leipzig Fair]] the car reappeared, badged now as the DKW-IFA F8.  Production of the [[East Germany|eastern IFA F8]] recommenced in or before 1949 at the Auto Union's Zwickau factory which was in the [[Soviet]] occupied zone of Germany and was expropriated to become the [[Volkseigener Betrieb]] (or "People Owned Enterprise") [[Automobilwerke Zwickau]] (AWZ).<ref>Audi website http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/about_audi_ag/history/chronicle/chronicle_1945_1959.html</ref>  

It is believed that by 1955 approximately a further 26,000 of the cars had been built.   A wider range of body options would be offered with the additions of an estate and the light commercial variants.   In 1954 a Cabriolet deluxe was introduced, intended primarily as an export special for the [[West Germany|western]] market<ref name=AlleAutosder50er/>. After the IFA brand had been phased out, the final F8s were evidently badged as Wartburgs.   The two cylinder 700 cc two stroke engine lived on in the iconic [[Trabant]].


E.M.W. ( IFA F9), 1954.
