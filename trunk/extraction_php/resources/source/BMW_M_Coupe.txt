The '''BMW M Coupe''' is a [[Shooting-brake]] styled high-performance [[automobile]] produced by [[BMW]]. As of February 2009, two generations of the M Coupe have been manufactured, one based on the [[BMW Z3|E36/8 Z3]] Coupe and the second off of the [[BMW Z4|E86 Z4]] Coupe. Both generations have a "sister" Convertible/Roadster model available. Though a second generation [[BMW Z4|E89 Z4]] has been released for the 2009 model year, no official announcements have been made regarding the third iteration of the BMW M Coupe/Roadster.

==First Generation E36/8 (1998 - 2002)==

The car is based on the [[BMW M Roadster]]. The semi-trailing arm rear suspension was not modified from the M Roadster. The coupe is 2.7 times stiffer than its [[convertible]] counterpart, resulting in superior handling.

The M coupe was developed under the leadership of engineer Burkhard Göschel with the intention of adding increased torsional and structural rigidity to the Z3 roadster’s chassis. The development team had a hard time convincing the Board of Directors to approve the model for production, but it was eventually given the green light as long as it remained cost-effective to produce. To achieve this goal, as many body panels as possible had to be shared with the roadster, thus the doors and everything from the A-pillar forward are interchangeable between the coupe and roadster, as are most interior parts. The Z3 coupe, which mates the M coupe's body with the standard Z3 drivetrain, chassis and cosmetics was approved for production at the same time.

===1998-2000===
M Coupes built between 1998 and 2000 are fitted with two different engines, depending on the destination market. These engines are the same ones used in the 1996 to 1999 [[BMW M3]].

The US models were fitted with the [[BMW M52#S52B32|S52]], a 240 [[horsepower|hp]] (176 [[kilowatt|kW]]) and 320 [[newton metre|Nm]] (236 ft·lbf) 3.2 litre [[I6|inline 6 cylinder]] engine.

European models were fitted with the [[BMW M50#S50B32|S50B32]], a 321 [[horsepower|hp]] (236 [[kilowatt|kW]]) and 350 [[newton metre|Nm]] (260 ft·lbf) 3.2 litre [[I6|inline 6 cylinder]] engine.

===2001-2002===
From October 2001, the M Coupe reappeared worldwide with the new 3.2 litre [[BMW M50#S54B32|S54]] engine from the E46 M3. This was the highest specific output [[naturally aspirated]] engine ever made by BMW when it was fitted to the E46 M3: in M Coupe form it produced {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}} in European form and {{convert|315|hp|abbr=on}} in North American form. (242 kW) and 354 Nm (261 lbf.ft) of torque.

Despite the well-documented tendency of the 2001-2002 S54 to suffer connecting rod bearing failure in the E46 M3, the M Coupe was not included in the recall to correct the issue in E46 M3s.  BMW assert that the recall is not necessary due to the fact that the S54 M Coupe is limited to 7,600 rpm, 400 rpm lower than the M3's limit.  BMW added a {{convert|100000|mi|km|sing=on}}, 6 year warranty in North America to all S54 Coupes affected by, but not included in the bearing recall on the M3.  Although some S54 M Coupes have reached in excess of {{convert|170000|mi|km}} on their original engines, bearing shell failures are possible on all S54 M Coupes.

===Production figures===
Due to the unique styling of the M Coupe, dealer sales were slow, and dealerships sidestepped the M Coupe to sell the more practical and more profitable M3 models to performance enthusiasts. As a result of their relative rarity, M Coupes retain more of their value than any other BMW since the E30 M3.

==Second Generation E86 (2006-2008)==

BMW released a limited production, new redesigned, M Coupe based on the [[BMW Z4|Z4]]. The first cars were delivered right after the North American introduction on May 27, 2006.
It has a 3.2 litre inline 6 cylinder engine and produces a SAE rated {{convert|330|hp|abbr=on}}. The M coupe engine was very different than the S54 engine. The new engine was made with a magnesium block. This brought the total weight of the motor down in comparison to the older (S54) engine, resulting in more performance. It shares many components with the Z4 and with the [[BMW_M3#E46_M3|E46 M3]].  Other components come directly from the [[BMW_M3#M3_CSL_.28E46.29|M3 CSL]] like the cross drilled 13.7" floating front rotors, even though it continues to use the same brake pads as the original Z3 M Coupes.

The second-generation [[BMW E89|E89 Z4]] was announced on December 13, 2008,<ref name="2009pressrelease">{{cite web |url=http://www.autospies.com/images/users/Agent001/2009_Z4_Roadster_Release.pdf |title=U.S Press Information: 2009 Z4 Roadster |accessdate=2008-12-14 |date=2008-12-13 |format=PDF |work=BMW |pages=17 |language=English}}</ref> and debuted at the 2009 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]] the following month.  Using a retractable hardtop, the new [[BMW E89|E89 Z4]] replaces the previous roadster and coupe versions for the 2009 model year. As of February 2009, there are no official announcements in regards to the either an M Roadster or M Coupe for the [[E89]].
