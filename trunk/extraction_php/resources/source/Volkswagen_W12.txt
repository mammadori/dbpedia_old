The '''Volkswagen W12''' Coupe (also known as the '''Volkswagen Nardò''', with reference to the vehicle test track near to the Italian city of [[Nardò]]) was a [[concept vehicle|concept car]] created by [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Passenger Cars]] in 1997.

==Initial conception==
[http://archive.cardesignnews.com/autoshows/2001/tokyo/highlights/images/vw-w12-1122s.jpg Picture].
At the request of then [[Volkswagen Group]] CEO [[Ferdinand Piech]], [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and his [[Italdesign]] team was tasked to design a Volkswagen sports car, with instructions that it had to accommodate a [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#W12|12 cylinder engine in a W configuration]], be mid-engined, and also be able to be configured with Volkwagen's [[4motion|Syncro]] [[four-wheel drive]] system.

Another reason for its conception was to prove to the world that Volkswagen Group could build a large and reliable engine for its luxury car, the [[Volkswagen Phaeton]], and its [[sport utility vehicle]], the [[Volkswagen Touareg]].

==The concepts==
===1997 W12 syncro===
In [[1997]], at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] Volkswagen debuted their first sports car concept, a bright yellow '''W12 syncro Coupe''' with a 5.6&nbsp;[[litre]] [[W12 engine]] producing {{convert|309|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} with [[4motion|Syncro]] [[four-wheel drive]].  It, and the W12 concepts after it, were all designed by the [[Italdesign]] firm in Italy.

===1998 W12 Roadster===
A year later at the [[Geneva Auto Show|Geneva Auto Salon]], a red '''W12 Roadster''' with the same 5.6&nbsp;[[litre]] [[W12 engine]] and [[rear-wheel drive]] configuration was shown, and its smaller amount of power than the coupe.

===2001 concept===
In 2001, at the Tokyo Motor Show, Volkswagen Group released their most powerful W12 sports car [[concept vehicle|concept]] yet, in bright orange.  The engine was rated at producing {{convert|441|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} and {{convert|621|Nm|0|lk=on}} of [[torque]]; it could accelerate from standstill to {{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in about 3.5&nbsp;seconds, and had a top speed of {{convert|350|km/h|1}}, weighing just {{convert|1200|kg|0|lk=on}}.  It was one of the fastest sports car concepts in the world.  It was created by Charlie Adair.

==24 Hour World Record Holder==
A special unpainted [[carbon fiber|carbon fibre]] version of the W12 Coupe set seven 24-hour world speed records at the [[Nardò Ring]]<ref>Notice that original Italian names has stress on the last [[syllable]].</ref> near [[Lecce]], [[Italy]].  The car's nickname was derived from the circuit.
