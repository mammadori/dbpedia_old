In 1987, The entirely electronic torque wrench, the DAZ-E, was developed which was able to display, save, analyse and document measurements for the first time. 

In 1992, the EKDS, an electronic torque wrench particularly suited to fast production tasks, is patented internationally.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==The situation today==
The company currently employs around 100 staff. Due to its numerous patents for torque wrenches, Saltus-Werk Max Forst is recognised as being a specialist and technological leader in all matters relating to controlled tightening. The company focuses on documented fastener tightening and special-purpose tools for manual and automated joint tightening for customers in the fields of vehicle manufacture, automotive suppliers, engineering and plant construction, shipbuilding and the aerospace industry, worldwide. As a result of constantly increasing demands for ever more detailed documentation of every stage of production, it is not uncommon to have to record 100% of all safety, function or operation relevant joints (e.g. brake leads) in terms of the tightening, auditing and documentation of the joints and storage of the results. These tasks are now simplified with electronic torque wrenches.
