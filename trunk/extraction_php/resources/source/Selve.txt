'''Selve Automobilwerke AG''' was a car maker located in [[Hamelin|Hameln]] (near [[Hannover, Germany]]). 

After [[World War I]], the ''Northern German Automobile Works'' ([[Norddeutsche AutomobilWerke]]), which made the [[Colibri car]] and the [[Sperber]], was absorbed by the Selve firm, which was already producing [[Basse & Selve]] engines for the automotive industry. The first cars produced were the 6/24 [[horsepower]] 1-1/2 [[liter]] engine displacement and the 8/32 horsepower 2 liter model. The 8/40 hp 2090 cc model (which was later carried over to the 9/40 hp and 2352 cc) was also available in a {{Convert|65|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} sport version.  Six-cylinder models of 2850 cc in engine displacement were produced in 1925 and the Selecta 3075 cc engine produced in 1927 completed the product line. 

These automobiles were produced until 1929, when car manufacturing was suspended due to the economic crisis of 1929.

A [[front-wheel drive]] 6-cylinder model designed by [[Henze]] was shown at the 1928 [[Berlin]] Automobile Exposition, but was never put into production.
