Number of valves is 2 intake and 2 exhaust with V-shaped overhead configuration. Valve operation is 2 top camshaft. Camshaft drive is duplex roller chain. Starter motor is electrical with 1.7 kW. Ignition system is ignition mapping control. The 2.8 L M104 was also used in the [[Mercedes-Benz W202|W202]] [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|C-Class]] model C280 and in the [[Mercedes-Benz W140|W140]] [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]] model S280 (the latter was not sold in North America).

This engine was found in the [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W210|W210]] [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|E-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz W140|W140]] [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz W463|W463]] [[Mercedes-Benz_G-Class|G-Class]], and [[Mercedes-Benz R129|R129]] [[Mercedes-Benz SL-Class|SL-Class]].

==AMG 3.4 L==

There were 3.4&nbsp;L conversions done to the 3.0 L M104.980 by AMG, prior to their formal cooperation with Daimler Benz.

[[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] developed a 3.4 L M104 that was used in the E34 and E34T AMG ([[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]]) vehicles. Amount of oil in engine is 7.5 litres and amount of coolant in engine is 9 litres. It made 272ps at 6500rpm and used Bosch KE-Jetronic (CIS-E) injection.

==AMG 3.6 L M104.941==

There were 3.6&nbsp;L conversions done to both the M103 and M104 by Brabus, among others.

[[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] developed a 3.6 L M104 that was used in the W202 C36 AMG ([[Mercedes-Benz W202|W202]]),the W124 E36 AMG ([[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]]) and the E36 AMG ([[Mercedes-Benz W210|W210]])   vehicles.

The AMG 3.6 M104 was rated at {{convert|276|hp}} at 5,750 rpm and {{convert|284|ft.lbf|N.m}} of torque at 4,000 rpm using the HFM engine management system.

The boost in power was obtained by stroking the 2,8 litre M104 using the crank from the 350sd engine.

==Turbo Conversions==

Turbocharger kits were offered for both the M103 and M104 engines by Turbo Technics, Mosselman, Lotec and other tuners.  These conversions typically raised engine output to between 300 and {{convert|400|hp}}.
During the 1990s UK customers were able to buy new vehicles eqipped with a Turbo Technics conversion directly from Mercedes dealer Hughes of Beaconsfield (limited run of 75 conversions).
