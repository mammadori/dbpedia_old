In 1983 [[BMW]] took the [[BMW M88|M88/3]] engine, a modified version of the M88/1 from the [[BMW M1]] and put it in the [[BMW E24|E24 chassis]] of the [[BMW 6-Series]], creating the M635CSi (called "M6" in North America).
The "M6" was critically acclaimed throughout its lifespan for its elegant, aggressive "shark-nose" styling, its well-appointed luxury features, and its quick performance. An M6 can be distinguished from other E24 models by a larger air dam, M badges on the grille and back, and a slightly larger front brakes.

In the U.S, the E24 "M6" was fitted with the [[catalytic converter|catalyzed]] S38B35 motor, producing 256&nbsp;hp (191&nbsp;kW) and 243&nbsp;ft·lbf (329&nbsp;N·m) of torque. The European version did not need catalysts, and produced 286&nbsp;hp (213&nbsp;kW) and 251&nbsp;ft·lbf (340&nbsp;N·m) of torque. The "M6" was good for a 0-60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) time of 6.4 and 6.8&nbsp;seconds for the European and American versions, respectively. However, Car and Driver Magazine tested the U.S. "M6" in July 1987 and achieved a 0-60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) time of 6.1&nbsp;seconds. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Also in 1987 Road and Track featured the U.S. "M6" as one of the 10 fastest cars in America.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Production of the "M6" ended in 1989, with 5,859 cars sold, 1,767 of which were North American (U.S. & Canada) models.

The new BMW M6 concept made its debut at the 2005 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. It is based on the [[BMW E63/E64]] 6-Series, introduced in 2004. It shares the same 5.0 L [[V10 engine|V10]] [[BMW S85|S85]] engine and SMG III gearbox with the [[BMW E60|E60]] [[BMW M5|M5]], and produces {{514 hp|0|abbr=on}} / {{convert|520|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}}. In recent top speed test on the network ''speed'' one of the test drivers on the german autobahn reached a top speed of 194 mph.

BMW claims it accelerates from 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h (62 [[Miles per hour|mph]]) in 4.4&nbsp;seconds (0-60&nbsp;mph: 4.1 s [Road & Track [2/06]) and has an electronically limited top speed of 250&nbsp;km/h (155&nbsp;mph). With the limiter removed, the top speed can reach 330&nbsp;km/h (205&nbsp;mph). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=106100|publisher=[[Edmunds.com|Edmunds]]|title=BMW's New M6 Is All You Need, and Then Some...}}</ref>

The M6 has the same 'power button' as the M5 which modifies the throttle response. From ignition, the car delivers 399 bhp (298 kW), but engaging the button allows the full {{convert|373|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}}. It weighs {{convert|3770|lb|abbr=on}} thanks to a [[carbon fibre]] reinforced plastic roof panel as well as [[thermoplastic]] front wings, aluminum doors and bonnet (hood) and compound boot (trunk) lid.

The carbon fiber and other light materials are used in places like the bumpers and roof that are far from the centre of gravity and/or high up, so that they not only reduce the overall weight but improve the [[Car handling|handling]] by reducing, respectively, the [[moment of inertia]] and the [[center of mass]] height.

It is currently available as a [[coupe]] and a [[convertible|cabriolet]]. A lightweight CSL version of the M6 was expected to be released in the near future, however, BMW has since officially stated that no such version of the M6 will be built, as there is currently no market for such a model.  The 2007 coupe is expected to have a 0-60 mph time in about 4.3&nbsp;seconds (4.8 convertible)(Road and Track, September 2006). Both the M6 coupe and convertible can be visually distinguished from the 630i, 645Ci and 650i by their deeper front valance with air intakes, more contoured side sills, aerodynamic side view mirrors, an additional rear valance with diffuser and the absence of front fog lights.
