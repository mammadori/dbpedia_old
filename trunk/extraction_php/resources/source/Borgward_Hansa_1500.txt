The '''Hansa 1500''' is a medium sized saloon that was manufactured by the [[Bremen]] based auto-manufacturer [[Borgward|Carl F. W. Borgward GmbH]].   The strikingly modern car first rolled off the production line on October 13 1949 <ref name=BorgwardbySchmidt>{{cite book |last=Schmidt |first= Georg|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Borgward – Carl F. W. Borgward und seine Autos|year=1986 |publisher=Motorbuchverlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn= 3-87943-679-7}}</ref>
and was replaced by the [[Borgward Isabella]] in 1954.   It is claimed as the first all new model launched by the German auto industry after the [[Second World War|war]].   Introduced nearly four years before the better remembered [[Mercedes-Benz W120/121|’Ponton Mercedes’]] the Hansa featured the then revolutionary [[Ponton (automobile)|three box form]] that subsequently became mainstream in Germany and across much of Europe.

== The body ==

The car was launched as a two or four door saloon with an all steel body built around a central steel frame.   The wings were fully integrated into the bodywork, and the passenger cabin filled the full width of the car.   At a time when competitor vehicles from [[Opel Olympia|Opel]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W136|Mercedes Benz]] were still based on conventional looking prewar designs, the interior width of the Hansa, emphasized by the inclusion of [[bench seat]]s both at the back and in the front, attracted favourable press comment.   The car was seen as a genuine six seater.<ref>''Auto und Motorrad-Welt,"  Issue 6, 20. March 1953</ref>   Also noteworthy in 1949 was the separate lid that permitted the boot / trunk to be accessed from outside the car.   At the other end, the bonnet / hood was hinged at the side and could be opened from either the left or the right side as necessary.   Instead of traditional semaphore style [[Trafficators|direction indicators]], the Hansa featured flashing lights for use as direction indicators<ref name="Kurze">Peter Kurze. Carl F. W. Borgward Automobilwerke,'' Verlag Peter Kurze, Bremen 2001, ISBN 3-9806977-3-8</ref>
, the flashing being replicated within the tri-functional rear lights which included within a single unit rear lights and brake lights along with the US style flashing direction indicators.

The driver was faced by a steering wheel linked to its central boss by three sets of four thin spoke like rods.   The design of the steering wheel, reminiscent of the [[Porsche 356|early Porsches]], ensured minimal disruption of the view of the instruments behind it.   Also behind the steering wheel was the column mounted gear lever.

A two door estate version and a five seater two door cabriolet were available along with a two seater sports cabriolet.   The cabriolets were both assembled by the coach builders Hebmüller in [[Wülfrath]] until May 1952.<ref name="Kurze"/>

== Engine, transmission and chassis ==

The Hansa was introduced with a 1498 cc four cylinder [[ohv]] engine providing a claimed power output of 48&nbsp;bhp (35&nbsp;kW).<ref name="Kurze"/>   For 1952 the engine was modified to produce 52&nbsp;bhp (38&nbsp;kW).   A 66&nbsp;bhp (49&nbsp;kW) output version of this engine was installed in the  sports cabriolet.

The column mounted gear lever controlled a [[Manual transmission|three speed gear box]].

The wheels were independently sprung, the rear wheels being attached to a swing axel and supported by springs with hydraulic shock absorbers.   All four wheels were connected to the  foot brake  via a hydraulic system, while the hand brake was a mechanical one operating on the rear wheels.

== More power ==

1952 saw the introduction of the faster Borgward Hansa 1800, with a 1758&nbsp;cc 4 cylinder engine producing 60&nbsp;bhp (44&nbsp;kW).   The Hansa 1800 benefited from a four speed gear box, with synchromesh between the top two ratios.   The front direction indicators which on the Hansa 1500 had been located beneath the headlights, now migrated to the top of the front wings on the Hansa 1800.

As before, the two and four door saloons were complemented by cabriolet and estate versions.

The next year the Hansa 1800 became available with a diesel engine of the same capacity as the petrol / gasoline fuelled unit, but with a power output of 42&nbsp;bhp (31&nbsp;kW).

An 1800 diesel saloon version tested by the British [[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]] magazine in 1954 had a top speed of {{convert|68|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and could accelerate from 0-{{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 27.9 seconds. A fuel consumption of {{convert|45.6|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded. The test car cost £1493 including taxes in the United Kingdom. <ref name=Motor1954>{{cite journal| authorlink = Unsigned |title = The Borgward 1800 Diesel| journal =[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]| volume = | pages = | date = March 10 1954}}</ref>
