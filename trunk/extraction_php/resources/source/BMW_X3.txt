The '''BMW X3''' is a [[compact SUV|compact]] [[crossover SUV]] marketed by the [[Germany|German]] [[automaker]] [[BMW]], based on the [[BMW 3-Series]] [[BMW E46|E46]] [[automobile platform]], and now in its first generation. BMW designed the X3 in conjunction with [[Magna Steyr]] of [[Graz]], [[Austria]] &mdash; who manufactures all X3's under contract to BMW.

Following the [[BMW X5|X5]], the X3 was the second vehicle marketed by [[BMW]] as a [[BMW Sports Activity Series|Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV)]].
 
==History and development==
BMW presented the precursor to the X3 as a [[concept vehicle]] unveiled at the [[Detroit Auto Show]] in 2003. Dubbed the xActivity, BMW previewed a [[BMW Sports Activity Series|SAV]] based on the 3 Series platform, without windows and a vestigial roof.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

As BMW used parts from the E39 5 Series in making the X5, likewise BMW engineers employed 3 Series parts with the X3, e.g., the rear suspension from the E46 330xi.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

==xDrive==
{{main|BMW xDrive}}
When the BMW X3 premiered in late 2003, BMW announced that it would employ a new 4 wheel drive system to power it and the X5, a system marketed as xDrive that would intervene transparently to the driver before the driver was aware of instability.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

==Reaction==
[[Image:BMW--X3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|2004-2005 BMW X3 3.0i (US)]]
The BMW X3 was initially criticized for its harsh ride, an austere, minimalist interior that relied heavily on obviously plastic components, and limited off-road usage, through its heavily road-biased chassis set-up. Critics also felt the car was overpriced; a basic 2.5i, which lacked cruise control or automatic headlights and had vinyl upholstery, exceeded $30,000 in the U.S. (Vinyl has never been offered in other markets). BMW sought to rectify these complaints in 2005, with various upgrades (see below). The X3 also disappointed some BMW purists by not being assembled at a BMW factory; instead, the car's production was outsourced to [[Magna Steyr]], based in [[Graz, Austria]]. However, [[Magna Steyr]] has won numerous awards for quality and has been the highest rated car assembly factory in [[Europe]].   It has also manufactured - amongst others - European market Chrysler/Jeep products, the 4-Matic Mercedes E Class derivatives, and even Saab 9-3 convertibles.

The automotive press has provided mixed views of the X3. [[Jeremy Clarkson]] even said that the X3 was for people who are clinically insane after his road test of it. He also criticized it for its harsh ride, and pointed to the poor off-road ability. He got stuck multiple times because of deep mud and used summer tires. Automotive press generally liked xDrive capability, safe bottom for rough terrain and  hill-descent control, but pointed to only real down side against typical off-road cars: missing gear reduction which allows to drive very slow on rough terrain without using clutch (on [[manual gearbox]]) or warming up gearbox ([[automatic gearbox]]).

The X3 ''3.0i'' won the [[Canadian Car of the Year]] ''Best New Sport Utility Vehicle'' award for 2005.

==2005 model year changes==
* [[Bluetooth]] could actually be ordered straight from the factory (part of the Premium Package) and functioned without dealer intervention.  (Although the BMW X3 was originally offered and promised with Bluetooth support in 2004, none of the cars that shipped from the factory actually had it installed. Few were able to get it to work with a little bit of tinkering from their dealer.)
* The interior was upgraded with more consistent plastic panels. Also instead of having grey carpeting which was present on all 2004 X3s, the 2005 X3 came with carpeting that matched the leather ordered (with the exception of the Terracotta interior with black carpeting).
* Slightly softer suspension.
* Front fenders are one piece, as opposed to the two piece found on 2004 models.
* A 2.0d engine became available in some markets - joining the 2.5i and 3.0i [[internal combustion engine|engines]] (found stateside) as well as the 3.0d engine sold elsewhere in the world.
* An 'Open-Door' indicator was added on the 2004 models.

==Revised BMW X3 (2006-current)==
For 2007, the X3 is powered by the N52 inline 6 cylinder engine that debuted on the 2006 E90 3 Series. In 2007 a face lift was given to the X3, including an X-drive update, suspension adjustments, an engine upgrade, and aesthetics inside and out.

As well in 2007 the BMW X3 range extended with smaller engines including the 4-cylinder petrol and diesel option. These options now becoming available to countries across Europe, America, Asia and Australia.

* The new [[BMW R6]] engines available across the rest of the BMW lineup were, as with the 2006 X5 and 2006 Z4, curiously absent from the 2006 X3. It is rumored that the X3 will not get the R6 until the all-new BMW X5 is released in 2007 which will include the R6 engine amongst other newer engines. The X3 will receive, however, redesigned monochromatic front and rear fascias to replace the flat black bumpers. [[Image:BMW 3.0si.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2006-2008 BMW X3 3.0si (US)]]
[[Image:BMW X3 rear 20071104.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2007 BMW X3 (facelift)]]

* U.S. bound 2006 X3's were all equipped with a special version of the 'M' technik bodykit as standard. The difference being in that the U.S. cars had unpainted door sills and wheel arches. U.S. spec Sport Package 2006 X3's got the full 'M' bodykit (with painted front, side and rear plastic) available in the rest of the world as a BMW accessory.

* 2.5i was removed for sale from the U.S. market as this market tended to go more for the 3.0i model.

* The new changes to the 2007 BMW X3 are now listed on the BMWUSA[http://www.bmwusa.com/]  home page. The 3.0si engine produces {{convert|260|hp|kW PS|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque, at a lower engine speed (2500 rpm). The front and rear fascia are changed, more closely resembling the X5 [[SUV]]. New LED lights and interior upgrades have also been introduced. The Cold Weather package includes heated seats in the front and the rear. [[Headlamp#Advanced_front-lighting_system_.28AFS.29|Adaptive headlamps]] and a panoramic sunroof are available, as well as upgraded dashboard components and leather seating. 

* The 2007 X3 with the [[automatic transmission]] has received owner compliants for poor shifting and lack of throttle response. Search the web for X3 and transmission to find compliants posted on several websites and also check the concerns filed with the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]].  It should be worth noting however that many BMW forums have attributed the X3's poor shifting and lack of throttle response to faulty transmission software programming.  The problem should go away by having the dealer reprogram the EGS with Progman V27.02.00 or higher.

*Outside the North American markets, diesel sales dominate the X3 model mix.  In Europe, the range starts with a 2.0 litre [[Straight-4|4 cylinder]] petrol, a 4cyl. turbodiesel (the most successful derivative) and continues with [[Straight-6|6 cylinder]] turbo & [[Twin-turbo|bi-turbo diesels]].  The range topper is the sport diesel with {{convert|286|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.  The X3 was in 2006 and 7 the best-selling AWD vehicle in the German market, an example of the reduced significance of off road capability in the segment.  In the European markets, 'all-weather' capability has assumed far more significance than traditional wilderness hero Jeep/Land-Rover sense of SUV in the expansion of the X3 and its rival's sales.

==X3 Cross Country==
[[Image:Jutta Kleinschmidt Dakar2007.jpg|thumb|X3 CC in the 2007 [[Dakar Rally]]]]
The X3 Cross Country, also known as the X3 CC is an X3 prepared for [[rally raid]] competition.<ref>http://www.crash.net/motorsport/wrc/news/166780-0/pwrc_al-attiyah_wins_baja_espana.html</ref><ref>http://www.bmwheaven.com/content/view/57/3/</ref> It features a 2.9 liter, twin turbocharged diesel engine.<ref>http://www.x-raid.de/index.php?id=26</ref>

==Notes==
The BMW X3 is the first BMW produced that has been cosmetically changed for every model year in production. For example the 2005 and 2006 BMW X5 models are identical, as opposed to the X3 which is visibly different for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.
