The '''Mercedes Simplex''' was an [[automobile|car]] produced from 1902-09 by the [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG, Daimler Motor Society, a predecessor of [[Daimler-Benz]] and [[Daimler-Chrysler]]). It continued the use of the [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] name as the brand of DMG, rather than Daimler.

The Mercedes Simplex was designed by [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. It featured powerful [[engine|engines]] whose power ranged from 40 to 60 [[horsepower|hp]]). Its large and wide body had a low center of gravity.

==The name==
The car's predecessor, the [[Mercedes 35hp]] of 1901, had broken with the previous primitive automotive standards. Now, DMG and Maybach intended to improve this further by providing "comfort by means of simplicity", hence the name Simplex.  A complementary explanation for the name is that, by the standards of 1901, the car was very simple to operate<ref name=AutoMotorundSport20026>{{cite journal| authorlink = Malte Juergens (Bernd Ostmann - Ed)| title =Emil und die Direktive: Der Mercedes Simplex von 1901 was die Vision eines Sachsen: Emil Jallinek aus Leipzig...| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = 2000 Heft 26| pages = Seote 148 - 153|date = date 13 December 2000}}</ref>.

==History==
===DMG, Maybach and Jellinek===
The creation of the previous model, the [[Mercedes 35hp]], predecessor of the Simplex, was due to DMG's  industrial might, the know-how of its industrial designer Wilhelm Maybach and [[Emil Jellinek|Emil Jellinek's]] enthusiasm for [[Auto racing|motorsport]]. Jellinek was DMG's foreign agent based on the [[French Riviera]] where he was the  [[Austro-Hungarian]] consul. That car had resulted in the company's early success.

In 1902, Maybach decided to incorporate a series of modifications to the Simplex, anticipating a large number of sales. To suit their basically [[Upper class|high society]]  clients, the new Mercedes would be shown publicly ''while driving through the most traditional avenues in town or to picnic in a park''.

===Mercedes Simplex as a racecar (1902)===
When Jellinek received his first Simplex on [[1 March]] [[1902]] at [[Nice]], he rushed to incorporate it into his Mercedes race team, competing in the ''Nice-[[La Turbie]]'' [[hillclimbing]] race. He defeated all his opponents again and setting new records. 

Also in 1902, in the [[United States]], a ''Mercedes Simplex'' won the ''5-mile track race'' at [[Grosse-Pointe]], [[Detroit]].

In this 1902 campaign, the third step involved [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II|William K. Vanderbilt Jr]], US billionaire and racecar enthusiast who created in 1904 the American [[Vanderbilt Cup]]. He had already set several records with the previous ''Mercedes'', in some of the most popular races around the turn of the century, usually long distance ones.

Now, with the ''Mercedes Simplex'', Vanderbilt took part in the ''600 mile race to [[Paris]]''. Later, he broke all records in the ''[[Ablis]] to [[Chartres]] race with flying start'', with a top-speed of 111.8 km/h. One of his ''Simplex'' units is the oldest surviving ''Mercedes'' car.

===The German Emperor was a ''simple'' fan===

''Mercedes-Simplex'' 's prowesses were resonating all around the world. More than ever DMG obtained clients among the most important social figures .  

Meeting Maybach personally at ''Berlin's automobile exhibition of 1903'' [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II]] of Germany expressed his admiration for the car. Congratulating him for all the achievements at the races, he contrasted these with car's name, commenting: ''"A truly beautiful engine you have here! But it's not as simple as that, you know."''

==Simplex Models==
In 1903, Maybach designed a second version of the ''Mercedes Simplex'', of 60 hp.

==Dimensions==
''Mercedes Simplex'' ' framework was long, wide and with a low center of gravity giving an improved stability at high speeds. The [[wheelbase]] was extended to 2.45 meters (8'1"). 

Its carefully designed frame was made of pressed [[steel]]. The engine was welded onto it directly keeping it at a low height.

Other general modifications reduced the overall Simplex weight to 942 [[kilogram|kg]] assuring better results in racing.

==Axles==
The original 1902 wheels were wooden, with 12 non-removable spokes and [[pneumatic]] [[tire]]s. Later, in 1905, the ''Mercedes Simplex'' pioneered cast-steel wheels. 

The front and rear axles were modernized progressively, becoming equal in diameter around 1909:
*1902: 910x90-1020x120. Rear 10% bigger.
*1909: 915x105-935x135. Roughly equalized.

Attached to these were the two powerful [[brake]] systems, one hand-operated and the other by foot: 
*the main hand brake acted on the rear wheels, with [[drum]] brakes 
*the secondary foot brake acted on the [[chain drive]]'s intermediate [[driveshaft]] 
Both systems were [[Watercooling|water-cooled]] by a sprinkling system over ''hot zones'' when braking.

Both axles were rigid, featuring semi-elliptic [[spring (device)|springs]]. The [[Steering|steering-axles]] were located at the extremes, decreasing the transmission of road shocks to the driver's hands.

==Drive system==
The ''Mercedes Simplex'' ' engine was mounted over the front axle. The engine's power was taken from a sprocket [[flywheel]], 60 cm in diameter, transmitting it to the rear drive by a long [[roller chain]].

The ''gate gear'' [[manual transmission|manual gearbox]] featured four speeds and reverse, controlling a coil spring [[clutch]] acting on the flywheel system. A lever produced both declutching and deceleration together.

==Engine==
The engine produced 44 [[Horsepower|hp]] at 1300 [[rpm]]. 

Its four [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]] featured:
*water cooling
*[[Lubricant|lubrication]] by driver-controlled pressure
*120 mm bore and 150 mm stroke 
*[[valves]] mechanically timed by enclosed [[camshaft]] mechanically
*[[engine displacement]] of 6786 cc
It used magneto electric-[[spark]] [[ignition system]], with single ''spray-nozzle'' [[carburetor]], for all cylinders; featuring a new [[atomization]] system, improved by preheating.

The engine was started up by a hand crank and helped by the use of a [[decompressor]]. 

Maybach's tubular [[honeycomb radiator]]  featured a rectangular grill of 8,070 square shaped pipes of 6x6 mm, with improvedairflow. 

Originally, when launched in 1902, the ''Mercedes Simplex''  radiator's did not have a [[fan (implement)|fan]]. A set of vanes mounted on the flywheel increased the air-flow throughout the engine/radiator's compartment. Its total water capacity, 7 [[litre]]s, was smaller than the previous ''Mercedes'' model by 2 litres. 

The engine compartment was covered by metal sheets. Its chassis base was also covered, something imitated by many other car models later.

== Surviving cars ==

*Between November 2005 and March 2006, the [[Mercedes-Benz Museum]], built over the original site of DMG Stuttgart-[[UntertÃ¼rkheim]] factory of 100 years ago, exhibits 13 original ''Mercedes Simplex'' units. The oldest one is the vehicle owned by Vanderbilt. There is also, an [[Argentina|Argentine]] unit preserving its specifically enlarged wheels to drive over the muddy [[Pampas]]' roads. All 13 cars are functional, taking part in several annually nostalgic competitions such as the ''[[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run]]'' and ''[[Gordon Bennett Revival]]''.
