The '''Volkswagen EA489 Basistransporter''' was a small [[front-wheel drive]] platform [[truck]] with a [[front-engine design|front-mounted]] [[Volkswagen air cooled engine]]. Created by [[Volkswagen AG]], It was about the size of a modern day [[Volkswagen Polo]] and is perhaps one of the rarest [[Volkswagen]]'s in the world due to the fact it was never sold in a developed country.

It was built between 1975-79, with only 2,600 units produced in completely [[complete knock down|knocked down kits]] in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]]; and 3,600 units were produced in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Mexico]], between 1976 and 1977 for Mexican market. 

It was evaluated for production in the following countries: [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Philippines]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Mexico]].  It was built in and sold as: Turkey as the EA489, Indonesia as the Mitra and Mexico as the Hormiga (meaning Ant in Spanish).
