'''Daimler [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]''' ({{ISIN|DE0007100000}}) (formerly '''Daimler-Benz AG''', '''DaimlerChrysler AG''') is a [[Germany|German]] car corporation (not to be confused with the British [[Daimler Motor Company]]) and [[automaker|the world's thirteenth largest car manufacturer]] as well as the largest truck manufacturer in the world. In addition to [[automobiles]], Daimler manufactures [[truck]]s and provides financial services through its [[Daimler Financial Services]] arm. The company also owns major stakes in aerospace group [[EADS]], high-technology and parent company of the [[McLaren (racing)|Vodafone McLaren Mercedes]] racing team [[McLaren Group]], and Japanese truck maker [[Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation]].

DaimlerChrysler was founded in 1998 when [[Mercedes-Benz]] manufacturer [[Daimler-Benz]] (1926-1998) of [[Stuttgart, Germany]] merged with the US-based [[Chrysler Corporation]]. The deal created a new entity, DaimlerChrysler. However, the buyout failed to produce the trans-Atlantic automotive powerhouse dealmakers had hoped for, and DaimlerChrysler announced on May 14, 2007 that it would sell Chrysler to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] of New York, a [[private equity]] firm that specializes in restructuring troubled companies.<ref name="dcx_20070514">{{cite press release

Daimler produces cars and trucks under the [[brand]]s of [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Maybach]], [[smart (automobile)|Smart]], [[Freightliner LLC|Freightliner]] and many others.

== History ==
Daimler AG is a German manufacturer of automobiles, motor vehicles, and engines, which dates back more than a century.

An ''Agreement of Mutual Interest'' was signed on May 1, 1924 between [[Benz & Cie.#Benz & Cie. and the Motorwagen|Benz & Cie]] (founded 1883) of [[Karl Benz]] and [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (founded 1890) of [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]].

Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until, on June 28, 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming [[Daimler-Benz]] [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]—and agreed that thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of [[Mercedes-Benz]] on their automobiles.

In 1998 Daimler-Benz AG "merged" with the American automobile manufacturer [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]], and formed '''DaimlerChrysler AG'''. In 2007, when the Chrysler group was sold off to [[Cerberus Capital Management]], the name of the parent company was changed to simply '''Daimler AG'''.

== Former Chrysler operations ==
Chrysler has suffered a series of setbacks in recent years, culminating in DaimlerChrysler's agreement to sell the unit to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] in May 2007 for US$6 billion.
Through most of its history, Chrysler has been the third largest of the "Big 3" US auto makers, but in January 2007, DaimlerChrysler, excluding its luxury Mercedes and Maybach lines, also outsold traditionally second place Ford, though behind General Motors and Toyota.

Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008.<ref>{{cite news

|publisher=CarAndDriver.com
|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the 'merger of equals' that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A [[class action]] investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist [[Kirk Kerkorian]] was dismissed on April 7, 2005.<ref>{{cite news

|title=DaimlerChrysler settles investor lawsuit
|date=25 August 2003
|publisher=CarAndDriver.com
|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref> The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman [[Jürgen E. Schrempp]], who resigned at the end of  2005 in response to the fall of the company's share price following the transaction. The merger was also the subject of a book ''Taken for a Ride: How Daimler-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler'', (2000) by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A. Stertz.<ref>{{cite news

|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref>

Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appear to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the [[Chrysler Crossfire]], which used extensive Mercedes parts and the [[Dodge Sprinter]]/[[Freightliner Sprinter]], a re-badged [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] van.

===Sale of Chrysler===
DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. [[General Motors]] was reported to be a suitor while [[Volkswagen]], the [[Renault]]-[[Nissan]] auto alliance, and [[Hyundai Motor Company]] had said that they weren't interested in buying the company.

On August 3, 2007, DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to [[Cerberus Capital Management]].  The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler.<ref>[http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-7145-1-858191-1-0-0-0-0-0-11979-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Daimler - Home - Cerberus Takes Over Majority Interest in Chrysler Group and Related Financial Services Business for EUR 5.5 Billion ($7.4 billion) from DaimlerChrysler<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. This is a remarkable reverse in fortunes on the US$36 billion paid to acquire Chrysler in 1998. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, [[Cerberus Capital Management]] will invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler’s financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself.

== Formula 1 ==
On November 16th 2009 Daimler had purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP. The company was rebranded as [[Mercedes Grand Prix]]. Ross Brawn will remain team principal and the team will be based in Brackley, UK. However the purchase of Brawn meant that Daimler will sell its 40% stake in McLaren back in phases which will end in 2011. Mercedes will continue to provide sponsorship & engines to McLaren until 2015. When McLaren will probably have to find an engine supplier or make it's own engines. Mercedes owns 45.1% of the new company with 30% for Aabar Investments and 24.9% for Ross Brawn. Mercedes returned to F1 with their own team after a 55 year absence because of a car killing 80 people in a Le Mans accident.<ref>{{cite web|author=By NESHA STARCEVIC Associated Press 2009-11-17 12:58 AM |url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1110392&lang=eng_news |title=Mercedes takes over Brawn GP - Taiwan News Online |publisher=Etaiwannews.com |date=2007-06-12 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref>
