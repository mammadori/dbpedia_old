The '''Porsche 956''' was a [[Group C]] [[sports-prototype]] racing car built by [[Porsche]] in 1982 for the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[World Sportscar Championship]].  It was later upgraded to the '''956B''' in 1984.

==Development==
Built to comply with the championship's new [[Group C]] regulations which were introduced in 1982, the car was a replacement for Porsche's successful [[Porsche 936|936]] model which competed in the previous [[Group 6]] category of the World Championship.  The project began in June 1981, and the first prototype chassis was completed on [[March 27]], [[1982]], in time for the beginning of the World Championship season.  [[Jürgen Barth]] tested the first chassis at Porsche's private test track.

The 956 features a chassis made of an [[aluminium]] monocoque, a first for the company, helping to allow the car to meet the {{convert|800|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} weight minimum in Group C.  The engine is the same as the one used in the [[Porsche 936]], the Type-935 2.65 L turbocharged [[Flat-6]], producing approximately {{Convert|635|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  A new 5-speed gearbox was also designed for the 956.

An improved chassis with better fuel efficiency from a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] electric system was developed for 1984, being termed the '''956B'''.  In total, twenty-eight 956s would be built by Porsche from 1982 to 1984, with an unofficial 29th chassis built from spare parts by Richard Lloyd Racing.

In 1983, 956 chassis #107 was used by Porsche as a testbed for their P01 [[Formula One]] engine, later badged as [[Techniques d'Avant Garde|TAG]] and used by [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]].  The car was able to test some of the characteristics of a Formula One car in order to develop the engine.

The 956 would be officially replaced by the [[Porsche 962]] in 1985, an evolution in the 956's design.

The 956 made its debut at the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] 6 Hour race, the second round of the [[World Endurance Championship|World Championship for Makes]] with [[Jacky Ickx]] and [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]] driving for the factory. After missing the following round at the [[1000 km Nürburgring]] for developmental reasons, the Ickx/Bell unit reappeared at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. They led the race for the entire 24 hours, eventually taking the overall win - their third win together. As they had already won in 1981 with a [[Porsche 936]] that had used an early version of the 956 engine, their car had start number 1. The two other factory 956 followed them, so the three factory Porsches finished 1-2-3 in the order of their starting numbers. 

Boosted by this success, Porsche sold customer versions of the 956 to privateer teams such as [[Joest Racing]], [[Obermaier Racing]], [[John Fitzpatrick Racing]], [[Richard Lloyd Racing]], [[Kremer Racing]] and [[Brun Motorsport]] who raced them independently of the factory.

The overall all-time lap record for the demanding 20&nbsp;km Nürburgring-Nordschleife circuit in the Eifel Mountains has been achieved during the qualifying session for the 1983 1000&nbsp;km Nürburgring, by [[Stefan Bellof]], who drove his 956 around in 6 minutes 11.13 seconds, at an amazing average speed (considering the difficulty of the track layout) of {{convert|202|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The race lap record is held by the same Bellof, during the 1983 1000&nbsp;km Nürburgring, the lap being clocked at 6:25.91.

At the [[1985 1000 km of Spa]], Bellof died after colliding with [[Jacky Ickx]]'s newer 962.  Safety concerns over the 956 led to the eventual end as teams upgraded to the safer 962. The 956's last win would come courtesy of [[Joest Racing]] in the last race of the 1986 WEC season, in what also turned out to be the 956's last race.
