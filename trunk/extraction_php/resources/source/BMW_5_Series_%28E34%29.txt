The '''BMW E34''' is the version of the [[BMW 5 Series]] [[automobile]] built from mid-1987 to 1996, with the Touring model ending June 1996. It replaced the [[BMW E28]] in 1988 and was replaced by the [[BMW E39|E39]] in 1996.

The E34 succeeded the [[BMW E28]] in 1989 with two models. The 525i used the [[BMW M20]] engine while the 535i used the larger [[BMW M30|M30]]. The cars were a blend of BMW tradition and modern technology.  BMW's traditional [[FR layout]] and [[straight-6]] were used, providing the smooth engine and optimal [[weight distribution]] BMW customers had come to expect.  The E34 also had a much stiffer body and was more streamlined than its predecessor, looking very much like the [[BMW E32]] 7-series.

The E34 was among the most reliable luxury cars on the market, earning the best-in-class ratings from Intellichoice in 1991, and still considered one of the most reliable BMWs ever made.<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/bmw/5series/review.html]</ref> It was also one of the safest cars on the road during its production, providing [[airbag]]s, 4-wheel [[anti-lock brake]]s, and a very rigid body structure to protect occupants in the event of an accident.<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/bmw/5series/review.html]</ref>  The E34's 60-0&nbsp;mph (97 to 0&nbsp;km/h) stopping distance of 130&nbsp;feet (40&nbsp;m) was the best of any production sedan in 1990.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}  It was also equipped with [[electronic stability control|automatic stability control (ASC)]] or [[traction control system|traction control (ASC+T)]] in later years on higher-specification variants.<ref>[http://www_ehow.com/about_5046219_information-bmw-e.html]</ref>

A few enhancements to the body's cosmetics and functionality, as well as a slew of engine and transmission evolutions, have appeared throughout its years of production. Among those, BMW's VANOS [[variable valve timing]] technology made its first appearance in the M50 2.5L engines built in September 1992 and later.

While [[Europe]] was given a large selection of engine choices and combinations, the [[North America]]n market was more limited. While North America received only the 525i, 525i Touring, 535i, 530i, 530i Touring, 540i, and the M5, the European market also got the E34 518i, 520i, 6-cylinder 530i, [[Diesel engine|diesel]] 525td/s, 525iX, M5 touring and 540i Touring. The cars were also available earlier in Europe than in America.

===525i===
[[Image:E34 525i skyline.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1991-1995 BMW 525i]]
The 525i was built throughout the E34 production, and in 1992 was offered as a [[Station wagon|wagon]] (touring version) in the [[United States|USA]]. In June 1990 (1991MY), the engine was switched from the [[single overhead cam]] M20 engine to the [[double overhead cam]] [[BMW M50|M50B25]] engine, raising power from 167 to 189 [[horsepower]] (141&nbsp;kW). Also, fuel economy by ten percent, and a change from a timing belt to a timing chain improved reliability. A further revision of the 525i engine took place in 1993, when [[VANOS]] was added to the M50 engine which was designated the M50TU. The TU represents a Technical Update, reflecting the variable valve timing technology (VANOS) added to the intake camshaft. VANOS brought a moderate horsepower increase, but flattened the torque curve from about 3,000 rpm up to redline at approximately 6,300 rpm.

===525iX===
[[Image:E34-Touring.jpg|right|thumb|250px|BMW 525i, E34 Touring version]]
The 525iX was the only four-wheel drive version in the E34 series. It was available both as a sedan and a [[Station wagon|wagon]] (touring version). It features a computer-controlled rear and middle differentials. The middle differential normally would divide 36% torque to the front axle and 64% to the rear axle, but could alter the ratio according to driving conditions (in case one of the axles started to slip).

===530i===
The six cylinder E34 530i was available in Europe starting in 1988 but it never arrived in North America. It had a [[BMW M30#M30B30|M30B30]] 3.0&nbsp;liter inline-6 engine producing {{convert|185|bhp|abbr=on}}. This European version of the 530i was discontinued in 1990.  The eight cylinder 530i model was introduced to North America in 1992.  Replacing the 535i, it had the new [[BMW M60#M60B30|M60]], 32 valve [[DOHC]] 3.0&nbsp;liter V8 engine producing {{convert|218|bhp|abbr=on}}. It was also offered in a touring version.

===535i===
[[Image:Bmw e34 alpina.jpg|right|thumb|250px|E34 Alpina B10]]
The E34 535i was introduced in Europe as a 1988 model but was not available in [[North America]] until 1989. Production of the E34 535i and its engine ended in 1993, replaced by the V8 530i and 540i models. Despite the 535i designation, the M30 engine found in the E34 535i was actually 3430cc (3.4&nbsp;liters). The car can get 14â€“17&nbsp;miles per U.S. gallon (17 to 14 L/100&nbsp;km) city and 20-23 mpg (U.S.) highway. A rare 535is model was available in some markets (not North America). It featured a [[limited-slip differential]] and sport trim.

===540i===
In 1993 BMW added a 4.0&nbsp;liter V8 to the 5 Series lineup.  It was available in both sedan and touring models (the latter not in US).  Its large, torquey engine, upgraded brakes, and rare optional 6-speed transmission (offered in 1995 in North America, and from 1993 to 1996 in Europe) made it very competitive in the sports sedan market. Only 1357 examples of the 95 540i 6spd were produced for North America.

====M60 Engine====
Both the E34 BMW 530i and 540i shared the [[BMW M60|M60 engine]], which used [[BMW M60#The Nikasil problem|Nikasil bore linings]]. In America and the United Kingdom this made both susceptible to premature engine wear, as high sulphur content in petrol in those markets resulted in deterioration of the linings. BMW then introduced an [[Alusil]] version of this engine, which solved the problem.

E34 M60 Nikasil/Alusil Engine Codes
M60B30 (530):

* 1 725 970 - Nikasil
* 1 741 212 - Nikasil
* 1 745 871 - Alusil

M60B40 (540):

* 1 725 963 - Nikasil
* 1 742 998 - Nikasil
* 1 745 872 - Alusil

These numbers are stamped into the engine block, and are visible from under the vehicle.

==540i M-Sport==
A rare '''540i M-Sport''' model was built in 1995.  This package included not just a firmer suspension and sport seats, but used many parts from the M5, save for the engine and transmission.  200 "Sport" models were built, 135 of them with a 6-speed manual. [[Canada]] also got a special version &ndash; the '''M540i''', which was similar to the American 540i Sport but had even more M5 parts, such as 345&nbsp;mm floating front [[disk brake|rotors]], 18&nbsp;inch M-Parallel wheels, and various trim pieces.  Only 32 of these cars were built, all with a manual transmission.  Australia was the final market that received one of the M5 enhanced 1995 540i 6 speeds.  70 '540i Manual Limited Edition's' were produced, all manual and all individually numbered.  They all came with full M5 running gear and interior and the 'throwing star' M-System II wheels, but didn't have the M-tech exterior kit fitted.

==M5==
The [[BMW M5|M5]] version of the E34 was produced from 1988-1995. It featured an [[BMW_M88#S38|S38]] [[straight-6]] engine, originally a 3.6 L with an output of {{convert|231|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}}, later upgraded to a 3.8 L producing {{convert|250|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}}.

In its last two years of production, it also sported the 6-speed manual gearbox that had been given to some of the 540i E34. This gearbox then followed through to the next generation of 5 series: the E39.

As with many M-Series cars, the body's styling was upgraded with aerodynamic and cosmetic enhancements to outline its sportier nature.

Along with a modified suspension, the M5 was outfitted with 17 and {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} alloy wheels. Interestingly, one of these wheel models was the {{convert|17|in|mm|adj=on}} M System wheels, which had two interchangeable fascia known as Turbine and Throwing-Stars (or T-Stars). These wheels are still highly sought and praised amongst BMW enthusiasts, and are sometimes worn without any fascia.
