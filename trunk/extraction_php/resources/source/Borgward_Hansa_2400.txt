[[Image:2005-08-27 Borgward 2400, Bj. 58.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Branded as the Hansa 2400 Pullmanlimousine, the notchback arrived a year after the fastback sedan:  its wheelbase was lengthened by {{convert|20|cm|in}}.]]

The '''Borgward Hansa 2400''' is large a [[straight 6|six cylinder]] saloon first presented in 1952 and  manufactured by the [[Bremen]] based auto-manufacturer [[Borgward|Carl F. W. Borgward GmbH]] between 1953 and 1959.   The car was launched as a fast back sedan: a longer wheel base notchback version appeared a year later.  The Hansa 2400 seems, at least in its early years, to have suffered from a reputation for inadequate brakes and other perceived quality defects:  in a market segment that was closely contested but small, the large Borgwards lost out to [[Mercedes-Benz W180|less flamboyant]] [[BMW 501|models]] from the German south.

==Chronology and design==
The Hansa 2400 commenced production in 1953 as a large fastback sedan, its profile reminiscent of the recently introduced [[Hudson Wasp|Hudson Super Wasp]].   It had presence.   Unusually even at this time, all four doors were forward opening which presumably facilitated access and egress.   The body was an all steel [[monocoque|integral]] structure, as on the car's [[Borgward Hansa 1500|four cylinder sibling]].

Sales material placed emphasis on the car's luxury features, such as a heating and ventilation system that ducted air direct to rear passengers as well as to the front, with each system separately adjustable.   Items such as the cigarette lighter, the self parking windscreen wipers and the side windows that wound down fully into the doors barely merited a mention.   The spare wheel was stowed flat in a compartment beneath the boot / trunk.  It was accessible through a hatch behind a section of the rear bumper / fender, so that a wheel change could be undertaken without the need to empty out the luggage.

==New Shape==

A year later a longer wheel base notchback version appeared:  options included a partition to enable the car to be used for traditional chauffer operations.

In 1955 production of the fastback sedan ceased.   The long wheel base car underwent a minor facelift which involved more prominent headlamp surrounds: it soldiered on in this form until 1959.

==Power==
It is possible that the car had originally been intended for sale with the four cylinder 1758 cc engine<ref name=AlleAutosder50er/> that instead found its way into an uprated version of the [[Borgward Hansa 1500|Hansa 1500]].   In the event, the larger car was launched with a six cylinder engine of 2337 cc for which a power output of {{convert|82|bhp|abbr=on}} was claimed along with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).   The 1955 package of improvements included engine modifications that increased the advertised output to {{convert|100|bhp|abbr=on}}.

Power was delivered to the rear wheels via a four speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on all ratios.   An automatic gear change option was also advertised<ref name=2400Hansabrochure>{{cite book |last=Borgward GbmH |first=Carl |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Sales Brochure for the Borgward Hansa 2400|year=ca. 1954 |publisher=Bogward |location=Bremen |id= }}</ref>, making the car, according to some sources, the first German car to be offered with automatic transmission.
