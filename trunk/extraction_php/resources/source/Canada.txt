'''Canada''' ({{pron-en|ˈkænədə}}) is a [[country]] occupying most of northern [[North America]], extending from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. It is the world's second largest [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|country by total area]]<ref name="cia_factbook">{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html|title=The World Factbook: Canada |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref> and its [[Canada–United States border|common border]] with the [[United States]] to the south and northwest is the world's longest.

The land occupied by Canada was inhabited for millennia by various groups of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal people]]. Beginning in the late 15th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored, and later settled along, the Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]]. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[dominion]] of four provinces.<ref name=AoC-dominion>{{cite web| title = Territorial evolution| work = Atlas of Canada | publisher = Natural Resources Canada | url =http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/anniversary_maps/terr_evol | format = html/pdf | accessdate = 2007-10-09| quote = In 1867, the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are united in a federal state, the Dominion of Canada.... }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Canada: History| work = Country Profiles | publisher = Commonwealth Secretariat | url =http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145152/history/ | format = html/pdf | accessdate = 2007-10-09| quote = The British North America Act of 1867 brought together four British colonies&nbsp;... in one federal Dominion under the name of Canada.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Hillmer| first = Norman | authorlink =| coauthors = W.

This widening autonomy was highlighted by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of 1931 and culminated in the [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]] of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]].

A [[federation]] comprising [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]], Canada is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]]. It is a [[Official bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] country, with both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]] as official languages both at the federal level and in the province of [[New Brunswick]]. One of the world's [[developed country|highly developed countries]], Canada has a diversified economy that is reliant upon its abundant natural resources and upon trade—particularly with the United States, with which Canada has had a [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship]]. It is a member of the [[G8]], [[G-20 major economies|G-20]], [[NATO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], [[World Trade Organisation|WTO]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], [[Organisation of American States|OAS]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], and [[United Nations]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Canada}}<!--Please see the talk page before editing or reverting this to specify which (of several) languages produced the word Canada. There are differences of opinion, which may be best discussed at the main article Name of Canada-->
[[File:Cartier.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=A bearded explorer dressed in dark velvet with a sheathed sword and a hat. He is on a ship and looks out towards the sea|[[Jacques Cartier]]]]
The name ''Canada'' comes from a [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] word, ''kanata'', meaning "village" or "settlement". In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] towards the village of [[Stadacona]].<ref name="Maura577–603">aura, Juan Francisco, 2009, (p.577–603).</ref><ref>{{cite book| first=Bruce G.| last=Trigger| coauthors=Pendergast, James F.| year=1978| chapter=Saint-Lawrence Iroquoians| title=Handbook of North American Indians Volume 15| location=Washington| publisher=Smithsonian Institution |pages=357–361 |id=OCLC 58762737}}</ref> Cartier later used the word ''Canada'' to refer not only to that particular village, but also the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]] (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as ''Canada''.<ref name="Maura577–603">aura, Juan Francisco, 2009, (p.603).</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12356/12356-h/12356-h.htm| title=Relation originale de Jacques Cartier| publisher=Tross (1863 edition)| author=Jacques Cartier| year=1545| accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>

From the early 17th century onwards, that part of [[New France]] that lay along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]] was named ''Canada'', an area that was later split into two British colonies, [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], until their re-unification as the [[Province of Canada]] in 1841.<ref name=Rayburn>Rayburn, Alan (2001) (p.1-22).</ref> Upon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the name ''Canada'' was adopted as the legal name for the new country,<ref name="Martin">{{cite journal| last=Martin| first=Robert| title=1993 Eugene Forsey Memorial Lecture: A Lament for British North America| journal=The Machray Review| publisher=Prayer Book Society of Canada| year=1993| url=http://www.prayerbook.ca/library/machray/issue5/machray5d.htm| accessdate=2008-11-05| quote=Strictly speaking, the official name of the new country was, simply, "Canada," but usage sanctioned "Dominion of Canada".}}</ref> and ''[[Dominion]]'' (a term from Psalm 72:8)<ref>{{cite book| last=Clarke| first=Michael| title=Canada: Portraits of the Faith| year=1998| page=60}}</ref> was conferred as the country's title;<ref>{{cite book| first=J.

Thereafter, as Canada asserted its political autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]], the federal government increasingly used simply ''Canada'' on state documents and treaties, a change that was reflected in the renaming of the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite web| title=Government of Canada Events 2009 Canada Site| publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada|work=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|date= 2009-10-19| accessdate=2009-10-19| url=http://canada.gc.ca/whats-quoi/nel_fg-eng.html#July| quote=Canada Day was established in 1879 under the name "Dominion Day" and became known by its current name in 1982.}}</ref>

==Provinces and territories==
{{Main|Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian federalism}}

Canada is a [[federation]] composed of ten [[province]]s and three [[territory (administrative division)|territories]].  In turn, these may be [[List of regions of Canada|grouped into regions]]: [[Western Canada]], [[Central Canada]], [[Atlantic Canada]], and [[Northern Canada]] (the latter made up of the three territories [[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]).  [[Eastern Canada]] refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together.  Provinces have [[Canadian federalism|more autonomy]] than territories. Each has its own [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial or territorial symbols]].

The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.<ref>Leacy, F. H. (ed.) (1983) [http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-516-x/sectionh/4057752-eng.htm#H209_220 H209-220]</ref>

Canadian culture has historically been influenced by [[British culture|British]], [[French culture|French]], and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] cultures and traditions. It has also been heavily influenced by [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] because of its proximity and the high rate of migration between the two countries. The great majority of English-speaking immigrants to Canada between 1755 and 1815 were Americans from the Thirteen Colonies. During the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]], 46,000 Americans came to Canada, exiled because of their loyalty to Britain. Between 1785 and 1812, another 30,000 moved to Canada—the so-called Late Loyalists—in response to promises of land, provided that they agreed to swear allegiance to the Crown.

The creation and preservation of distinctly Canadian culture are supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), the [[National Film Board of Canada]], and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |author=National Film Board of Canada |work= |url=http://www.onf.ca/medias/download/documents/pdf/NFB_STRATEGIC_PLAN.pdf |format=pdf |title=Mandate of the National Film Board |year=2005|accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref>

Canada is a geographically vast and ethnically diverse country. Canadian culture has also been greatly influenced by immigration from all over the world. Many Canadians value [[multiculturalism]] and see Canadian culture as being inherently multicultural.<ref name="bickerton" /> Multicultural heritage is the basis of [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

Canada's [[National symbols of Canada|National symbols]] are influenced by natural, historical, and [[First Nations]] sources. The use of the [[maple leaf]] as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's [[Flag of Canada|current]] and [[Canadian Red Ensign|previous flags]], on the [[penny (Canadian coin)|penny]], and on the [[Coat of arms of Canada|Coat of Arms]].<ref name="symbol1">{{cite book | author=Canadian Heritage | title=Symbols of Canada | year=2002 | location=Ottawa, ON | isbn=0-660-18615-2 | publisher=Canadian Government Publishing}}</ref> Other prominent symbols include the [[beaver]], [[Canada Goose]], [[Great Northern Loon|Common Loon]], [[Monarchy of Canada|the Crown]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]],<ref name="symbol1"/> and more recently, the [[totem pole]] and [[Inukshuk]].

Canada has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, including the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal, the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, and the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]].

Canada's two official languages are [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Official bilingualism]] is defined in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], and ''Official Language Regulations''; it is applied by the [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|Commissioner of Official Languages]]. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French, and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Legislation on Official Languages|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|date=2007|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/prbpubs/938-e.htm|accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref>

English and French are the [[first language|mother tongues]] of 59.7% and 23.2% of the population respectively,<ref name="statcan_language">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo11a.htm |title=Population by mother tongue, by province and territory|date=2005-01-27|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> and the languages most spoken at home by 68.3% and 22.3% of the population respectively.<ref name="home_language_2001">{{cite web| url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&PID=55535&APATH=3&GID=431515&METH=1&PTYPE=55440&THEME=41&FOCUS=0&AID=0&PLACENAME=0&PROVINCE=0&SEARCH=0&GC=0&GK=0&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&FL=0&RL=0&FREE=0|title= First Official Language Spoken (7) and Sex (3) for Population, for Canada, Provinces, Territories and Census Metropolitan Areas 1 , 2001 Census&nbsp;– 20% Sample Data| work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population| accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> 98.5% of Canadians speak English or French (67.5% speak English only, 13.3% speak French only, and 17.7% speak both).<ref name="statcan_language2">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo15-eng.htm |title=Population by knowledge of official language, by province and territory|date=2005-01-27|accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> English and French Official Language Communities, defined by First Official Language Spoken, constitute 73.0% and 23.6% of the population respectively.<ref name="statcan_language2"/>

Although more than 85% of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in [[Franco-Ontarian|Ontario]], [[Franco-Albertan|Alberta]], and southern [[Franco-Manitoban|Manitoba]].<ref name="lachapelle">{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/about-apercu/diversity-franco-diversite-eng.htm|title=The Diversity of the Canadian Francophonie|last=Lachapelle|first=R|date=March 2009|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has an [[Acadians|Acadian]] population in the northern and southeastern parts of that province, constituting 33% of the population.<ref name="acadia">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0009091|title=Acadia, Contemporary|date=2009|publisher=Historica-Dominion|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on [[Cape Breton Island]], and through central and western [[Prince Edward Island]].

Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status but is not fully co-official.<ref name="flsc-ON">{{cite web|url=http://www.flsc.gov.on.ca/en/node/4|title=French Language Services Act|date=2008|publisher=French Language Services Commissioner|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> Several aboriginal languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.<ref name="lang-NWT">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.nt.ca/langcom/english/general-information/what-is-official-lang-act.html|title=General Information|publisher=Languages Commissioner of the NWT|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> [[Inuktitut]] is the majority language in Nunavut, and one of three official languages in the territory.<ref name="lang-NV">{{cite web|url=http://langcom.nu.ca/languages/en_inuktitut.html|title=Inuktitut / Inuinnaqtun |date=2004|publisher=Office of the Languages Commissioner of Nunavut|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref><ref name="lang-NV2">{{cite web|url=http://www.langcom.nu.ca/rights/en_yourrights.html|title=Your Language Rights in Nunavut|date=2004|publisher=Office of the Languages Commissioner of Nunavut|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref>

Languages other than the two official languages are significant in Canada, with over six million people listing one as a first language. Some of the most common non-official first languages include [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (mainly [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]; 1,012,065 first-language speakers), [[Italian language|Italian]] (455,040), [[German language|German]] (450,570), [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (367,505) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (345,345).<ref name="statcan language"/>
