The '''Volkswagen Citi Golf''' was a [[automobile|car]] produced by [[Volkswagen]] in [[South Africa]] from 1984 till 21 August 2009.  Formerly known as both the CitiGolf, Citigolf (one word), or Chico, it is a facelifted version of the original [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1]] [[hatchback]], which ceased production in [[Germany]] in 1983.  The car is produced in right-hand drive only.

Volkswagen South Africa (VWSA) assembled the Mk1 Golf from 1978 to 1984 when it was replaced by the Golf Mk2.  VWSA however decided to retain the Mk1 as an affordable fully locally manufactured entry level car.  Tooling mostly came from the [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA, plant when it ceased production there as well after the 1984 model. {{Fact|date=April 2009}}

The original Citigolf was available in a limited range of solid (non-metallic) colours (a fact highlighted in the contemporary advertising campaign which used a tagline "Red, Yellow, Blue... Not Green!").  The early cars were distinguished by white bumpers and wheels, as well as white appliqués carrying the CITIGOLF and CITI graphics mounted on the lower door panels and on the tailgate. 

Initially, the bodywork was identical to that of the superseded Mk1 Golf, but a locally-penned facelift gave it a sloping grille, similar to that of the Mk2 model Golf, as well as more modern "deep" bumpers in body colour.

In 2004, the Citi Golf received a new dashboard lifted from the [[Škoda Fabia]].  Until a further facelift in the second-quarter of 2006, it sported tail-lights similar to post-1980 Euro Mk1s.  The 2006 facelift saw modifications to the front bumper (adding a second grille in the lower half) as well as new, unique-to-South-Africa tail lights incorporating a circular inset tail light/brakelight combination.  

A [[sedan (car)|sedan]] version called the [[Volkswagen Fox|Fox]] ([[VW Jetta]] A1) was also produced, along with a [[pick-up truck]] (known in South Africa as a bakkie) called the [[Volkswagen Caddy|Caddy]].

The Citi Golf and the Caddy (renamed the Pickup after the introduction of the current Caddy) are no longer in production but VWSA still has stock. VWSA now also produces the Golf Mk5, Jetta Mk5, the [[Europe]]an [[VW Polo]] hatchback and its Brazilian sedan derivative.  The Citi Golf is intended to complement this range as an entry-level vehicle.

"Special Edition" Citi Golfs carrying unique trim and equipment combinations have been released throughout the car's production run and include the "Designa", the "Blues", the "Ritz", the "Rhythm" and the "Citi.com" which, in theory, was available only if ordered over the Internet.  Another special edition called the "Deco" introduced colour coded leather seats to the car in 1995.  It was available in three derivatives namely red, green and a special electric blue.  The latter was initially only offered on the Citi but was later transferred to other Volkswagen models as well. The "VeloCiti" model, which included the 1.8iR, was one of the best sellers. Other limited editions included the Citi Billabong and Citi Xcite. The most recent special edition is the "GTS". Which is takes its cues from the orginal GTS.

The one addition to the Citi Golf lineup is the Citi 1.8iR which was unveiled at the Auto Africa Expo during October 2006 in Johannesburg.  It features enhanced styling and specification, including a full bodykit, partial leather front seats, and aluminium trim on the dashboard.  The engine is a 1.8 litre fuel-injected unit which, although it shares its displacement with the iconic CTi, pushes out 8&nbsp;kW of extra power, taking it up to 90kW.  VWSA claims that it can accomplish 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h in 8.5 seconds. This was also a limited edition and only a handful were made between 2006 and 2008.

The Citi Golf was, for a time, also available in a fuel-injected 1.8 litre CTi variant (at a time when other versions still had carburettor engines).  The CTi was very similar to the original Golf I GTi. In addition, there was a 1.8 litre carburettor-engined Sport variant (advertising tagline "New Citigolf Sport, drive it home, Sport, drive it home.").

It is strongly rumoured that the Citi Golf is to finally be replaced by the 2009 VW Gol.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

The Citigolf has come to end of production in SA after 25 years. There is a special release of this called the Citi MK1, where they will has special features and be numbered til 1000. See the following link http://www.goodbyeciti.co.za/ VWSA Citi MK1 ]
