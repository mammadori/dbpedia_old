'''T2''' designates series of '''Mercedes-Benz''' transporters. The T2 is also called the "Düsseldorfer transporter", since it was built until 1996 in [[Düsseldorf]]. The third series, built from 1996 at [[Ludwigsfelde]], is branded the '''Vario'''.

==First generation (1967-1986)==
1967 saw the introduction of the T2 as a successor of the series [[L 319/L 406]]. The vehicles filled the gap between Bremen Transporters and the heavier trucks, manufactured in [[Wörth]]. The T2 was available as a box van, a flat-bed light truck (with single or double cab), or a bus. From 1977 the chassis was offered, for the mounting of larger box van and bus bodies, in two different widths. In 1981 the T2 received a facelift. The most visible differences were the new, [[radiator grille]], which now was a moulding of black [[plastic]]. The various T2 versions were popular for a wide range of applications:  they were used as delivery vans, light builders' vans or trucks, fire-brigade and rescue support vehicles, post office parcel delivery vans (featuring a sliding door on the driver's side) and for very many other uses. In the early 1970s, T2 was also offered branded as a ''Hanomag Henschel''. The production of flat-bed trucks of the first generation ended after 19 year construction period, after approximately 450,000 vehicles had been produced, in 1986. 

==Second generation (1986-1996)==
The second generation of the T2 was introduced in 1986, and was built until 1996. It was significantly upgraded, the hood having become longer and the design altogether more sharp-edged.It's chassis has been used in minibuses in the United Kingdom with 5 variations.They are 609D , 709D , 711D ,811D , 614D, 714D, 814D.

==Third generation ("Vario") (since 1996)==

Since 1996 the T2 has been assembled at the Ludwigsfelde [[factory]] and branded as the "Vario". Visual differences between the Vario and its predecessors are quite small, but include new headlights and radiator grille: at the same time the interior was revised.
