'''Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB)''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[aerospace]] company formed as the result of several mergers in the late 1960s. Among its best-known products was the [[MBB Bo 105]] light twin helicopter. The company was bought by [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace|DASA]] in 1989, now part of [[EADS]].

On [[6 June]] [[1968]], [[Messerschmitt]] AG merged with the small civil engineering and civil aviation firm [[Bölkow]], becoming Messerschmitt-Bölkow. The following May, the firm acquired [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau]] (HFB), the aviation division of [[Blohm + Voss]]. The company then changed its name to Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB). 

Originally 51% of MBB was owned by the Blohm family, [[Willy Messerschmitt]] and [[Ludwig Bölkow]]. 22.07% was owned by the German State of [[Hamburg]], 17.05% by the state of  [[Bavaria]], 7.16% by [[ThyssenKrupp|Thyssen AG]], 7.16% by [[Siemens AG]], 7.13% by [[Allianz|Allianz Versicherungs-AG]], 7.13% by [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] and 6.15% by [[ThyssenKrupp|Friedrich Krupp GmbH]].<ref>Commerzbank AG: "Wer gehört zu wem", Hamburg 1985, 15. Auflage</ref> 

In 1981 MBB acquired the [[Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke|Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW)]], which itself had been formed by merging  [[Focke-Wulf]], [[Focke-Achgelis]] and [[Weser Flugzeugbau|Weserflug]]. In the following year MBB acquired the astronautics company [[Entwicklungsring Nord|Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO)]] and became MBB-ERNO, which had turnover of 2.9 billion Euros in 1982.

In [[1989]] MBB was taken over by "Deutsche Aerospace AG" (DASA), which was renamed "Daimler-Benz Aerospace" in 1995. With the 1998 merger of [[Daimler Benz]] and [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]], the aerospace division was renamed [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace]]AG on [[7 November]] [[1998]]. European defense consolidation led to DASA's being merged with [[Aerospatiale-Matra]] of France and [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA]] (CASA) of Spain to form the [[EADS|European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS)]] in 2000. The former DaimlerChrysler Aerospace now operates as "EADS Germany".<ref>Answers.com (n.d.). [http://www.answers.com/topic/messerschmitt-b-lkow-blohm-gmbh].  Retrieved [[22 March]] [[2007]].</ref>
