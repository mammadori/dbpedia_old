'''Siegmund Lubin''' ([[April 20]], [[1851]] - [[September 11]], [[1923]]) was an [[United States|American]] businessman and [[motion picture]] pioneer.

Born as '''Siegmund Lubszynski''' in [[Breslau]], [[Silesia]], [[Germany]] (now [[Wroc≈Çaw]], [[Poland]]) to a [[Germany|German]] [[Jewish]] family, in 1876 he emigrated to the [[United States]] where he became a successful [[optician|optical]] shop owner in the city of [[Philadelphia]]. His business led to a fascination with [[Thomas Edison|Thomas Edison's]] new motion picture invention and eventually Lubin entered the film business. He started by making his own camera/projector combination which he sold with reasonable success. However, in 1896 he began distributing films for Edison, including the famous ''[[The Kiss (1896 movie)|The Kiss]]''. The following year, Lubin started making films himself and in 1902 formed the [[Lubin Studios|Lubin Manufacturing Company]], [[corporation|incorporating]] it in 1909. America's insatiable appetite for film entertainent saw Lubin quickly build a massive filmmaking empire. By 1910 his company had constructed "Lubinville," one of the largest and most modern [[film studio]]s in the world. Headquartered in Philadelphia, the company had secondary studios around the United States and became a major force in the domestic and international film industry. 

However, the company's downfall came even faster than its meteoric rise. Not being as adroit as its competitors in shifting to quality feature-length films plus a disastrous fire at its main studio in June 1914 that destroyed the negatives for a number of unreleased new films, severely hurt the business. When [[World War I]] broke out in [[Europe]] in September of that year, Lubin Studios, and other American filmmakers', lost a large source of income from these foreign sales. The dissolution of the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] spelled the end of Lubin's business and after making more than a thousand motion pictures, on [[September 1]], [[1917]], the Lubin Film Company closed its doors forever. Siegmund Lubin lost a personal fortune but had had the foresight to place his original optical business in his wife's name. As such, he had a business to fall back on that provided a living until his death in 1923 at his home in [[Ventnor, New Jersey]].

==Legacy==
