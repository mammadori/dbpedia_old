The fifth generation '''Volkswagen Golf Mk5''' (VW ''Typ 1K''), built on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform]] was unveiled at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in October 2003 and went on sale in [[Europe]] one month later.  To commemorate this, [[Wolfsburg]] was renamed "Golfsburg" for a week.  It reached North American markets in June 2006 rebadged with the revived Rabbit nameplate.<ref>Motor Trend [http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suv/112_0610_2006_volkswagon_rabbit Newcomers: 2006 Volkswagen Rabbit]</ref>  Most print ads for the Rabbit show the old badge (a running rabbit) with the phrase "It's back, at $14,990".  TV ads show Rabbits chasing after each other with their numbers increasing until they fill the streets of a city, a take on the cliche "multiplying like rabbits".

In North America, where [[SEAT]] and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] are not marketed, [[Volkswagen]] sought to revive their image on that continent as a value brand, and the pricing of the new Rabbit was a part of that strategy.

The Mk5 was replaced in 2009 by the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6|Mk6]] in Europe. The U.S. may expect to see the Mk6 by 2010.

==Features==

{{Weasel|date=March 2009}}
===Design===
While the interior quality of the previous [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]] startled rivals, and led most of them to up their game in revised/replacement models, the astonishing chassis and all round ability of the Mk1 [[Ford Focus (International)|Ford Focus]] startled Volkswagen (and indeed other rivals).  In order to counter criticisms of the average dynamics of the previous model, it is widely reputed that Volkswagen poached from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] the engineering team{{Fact|date=May 2008}} who designed the [[Multi-link suspension|multi-link]] ''control blade'' independent rear [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system, the class benchmark for ride and handling.  The suspension changes, along with careful tuning of the chassis, led to the Mk5 Golf delivering better road manners.  However, this also sacrificed usable cargo space; despite this model's considerable increase in size over the outgoing model, its hatch volume is roughly 3 cubic feet less.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

[[Image:Volkswagen Rabbit 5-door.jpg|thumb|left|Volkswagen Rabbit 5-door (US)]]

The bulletproof interior quality of the previous generation appears to have been lost, and although still of a very high standard and ahead of other rivals, the Golf no longer matches its in-house rival, the [[Audi A3]].  Many believe the reason for this step back in quality, also seen in the Mk5 Passat of 2005, is to allow daylight between the marketing and price positioning of [[Audi]] and Volkswagen products.  The previous generation Volkswagens were on a par with their Audi cousins.

The Golf 5 has proven expensive to build{{Fact|date=June 2008}} - largely due to its uncommonly long 50-hour build time.  Its replacement has been moved forward from the previously stated 2009 in Europe to Autumn 2008, right after its official premiere at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in September 2008.

===Powertrain===
Options for [[internal combustion engine|engines]] and [[transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] vary from country to country, but the Golf Mk5 is available with [[straight-4|4-cylinder]] [[petrol engine]]s, and a new Pumpe Duse [[Unit Injector|unit injector]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]].  Transmission options include [[manual transmission|manual]], [[automatic transmission|automatic]], [[Tiptronic]], and [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG).

[[United States]] and [[Canada]]-spec Rabbits use the same 2.5L [[straight-5|five-cylinder]] gasoline engine that powers the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] and [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]] in these markets, making {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{Auto ft.lbf|170|0}} in 2006-2007 models, and {{convert|170|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{Auto ft.lbf|177|0}} from 2008 onward.  North American transmission choices include a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic with [[Tiptronic]] for the Rabbit.  Diesel engines have been unavailable on Rabbits, though they were offered through 2006 on the Jetta until tightening emissions regulations in the U.S. led to their temporary unavailability.

The GTI comes with VW's 4-cylinder 2.0L Turbo [[Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) which makes {{convert|200|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} and {{convert|280|Nm|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} torque.  Transmissions include a 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG.

In September 2005, the Golf Mk5 GT was announced, which featured a choice of either 1.4&nbsp;L petrol engine in [[twincharger]] (TSI) configuration, or a 2.0 litre TDI.  Both are available as {{convert|125|kW|PS bhp|abbr=on}} versions; while the diesel also is available as a {{convert|140|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} variant in the UK.  The {{convert|170|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} diesel has {{convert|350|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, which is more than the range topping R32.  The petrol engined offering contains the new [[Twincharger]] (TSI) engine, which is based on the recent [[Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), but with a pair of chargers forcing the induction of the air.  The chargers are a single [[supercharger]] that disengages after a specified rev-range, at which point charging of the air is handled by a single [[turbocharger]].  This system benefits from both of the efficiency of the supercharger in the lower rev ranges, with the longevity of the turbocharger higher in the rev range.  This results in no [[turbo lag]], constant power delivery along the rev range, and better fuel efficiency than similarly powered [[V6 engine]] 2.4&nbsp;L due to its small size.  Both petrol and diesel versions are also available with DSG ([[Direct-Shift Gearbox]]).  Performance figures for the petrol vehicle are 0-{{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} in 7.9s (6 speed) and 7.7s (DSG), with the diesel taking 8.2s, and both reaching top speed of {{convert|220|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.  Volkswagen has no plans to sell the GT version in the US or Canada.

==Models==
===Mk5 Jetta===
{{main|Volkswagen Jetta#Fifth generation}}
A booted/trunked version of the Mk5 Golf was spawned in 2004 and, as with previous incarnations of the Golf, it maintained its own identity, a practice long abandoned by most rivals.  While the Jetta name has always remained in North America, the name made a return to Europe replacing the "Bora" name of the previous Mk4 Golf saloon.  The Jetta name was also introduced to [[Australia]] with the Mk5, the Mk4 Bora being a slow seller there.

As with its predecessor the Mk5 Jetta features unique front wings,{{Fact|date=July 2008}} front doors{{Fact|date=July 2008}} and rear doors, so the only external panel shared with the Golf hatchback is the bonnet.  As with all Golf-based saloons, the Jetta features a unique grille which is only shared with the contemporary Golf R32 (although the GLI variant has the Golf GTI's front end).  Unlike all previous saloon variants however, the front lights were now shared with the Golf.

Because of the preference for sedans in the US market, the Jetta outsells the Golf by a ratio of 4 to 1.<ref>Volkswagen of America, Inc - Newsroom [http://media.vw.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=10171 VOLKSWAGEN POSTS JUNE SALES INCREASE OF FIFTEEN PERCENT]</ref>

===Volkswagen Eos===
{{main|Volkswagen Eos}}
There will be no Cabriolet ([[convertible]]) version of the Golf Mk5, as the [[Volkswagen Eos]] [[retractable hardtop|coupé convertible]] (introduced in Spring 2006) will be marketed as a separate model, and the [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]] convertible makes a Golf Cabrio redundant.  The Eos does not share body panels with any other Volkswagen model, although it is based on the A5 Golf/Jetta platform.

===Mk5 Golf Variant===
The latest generation of the Golf Variant, a Golf [[station wagon|estate car/wagon]], was presented in a world premiere at the International Geneva Motor Show (8-18 March 2007).  It is to be sold in the [[North America]]n markets as the Jetta Sportwagen.

===Golf Plus===
In December 2004, Volkswagen announced the '''Golf Plus''' variant of the Golf Mk5.  It is {{convert|95|mm|2|abbr=on}} taller than the standard Golf, but {{convert|150|mm|2|abbr=on}} shorter than the other [[compact MPV]] of the marque, the seven-seater [[Volkswagen Touran]].

At the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]] Volkswagen released the new CrossGolf [[compact MPV]], which is essentially an off-road version of the Golf Plus.  It was developed by VW Individual division, which developed the Golf R32 and [[Volkswagen Polo|CrossPolo]].  The CrossGolf is only available in [[front-wheel drive]] configuration (like the CrossPolo), and is powered by two [[petrol engine]]s 1.6, and 1.4 TSI, and two [[diesel engine]]s, 1.9 TDI and 2.0 TDI, with outputs ranging from {{convert|102|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} to {{convert|140|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}.  In the UK this model is badged as "Golf Plus Dune" and sold with the 1.9 TDI outputting {{convert|105|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}.

==Performance models==
===Mk5 GT===
The Golf Mk5 '''GT''' features a choice of either 1.4 L [[petrol engine]] in [[twincharger]] (TSI) configuration, or a 2.0 litre [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] [[diesel engine]].  Both petrol and diesels are available as {{convert|125|kW|PS bhp|abbr=on|lk=on}} versions.  The diesel has 350 [[N·m]] (258 [[ft·lbf]]) of torque, which is more than the range topping R32.  The petrol engined offering contains the new TSI engine, which is based on the recent [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), but with a pair of chargers forcing the induction of the air.  The chargers are a single [[supercharger]] that disengages after a specified rev-range, at which point charging of the air is handled by a single [[turbocharger]].  This system benefits from both of the efficiency of the supercharger in the lower rev ranges, with the longevity of the turbocharger higher in the rev range.  This results in little [[turbo lag]], constant power delivery along the rev range, and better fuel efficiency than similarly powered 2.4 L [[V6 engine]] due to its small size.

Both petrol and diesel versions are also available with [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG).  Performance figures for the petrol vehicle are 0-{{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} in 7.9 seconds (6-speed manual) and 7.7 seconds (DSG), with the diesel taking 8.2 seconds, and both reaching top speed of {{convert|220|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.

The Golf GT features the same brakes as the Golf GTI, with {{convert|312|mm|abbr=on}} ventilated front discs, and {{convert|286|mm|abbr=on}} solid rears.  It has also {{convert|15|mm|abbr=on}} lowered suspension, which lowers its centre of gravity, it borrows the GTI's suspension/damper settings, uses 7Jx17" "ClassiXs" alloy wheels fitted with wide 225/45 R17 [[tire|tyres]], and has twin exhaust outlets.

===Mk5 GTI===
[[Image:Volkswagen GTI 3-door.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mk5 GTI 3-door]]
[[File:Volkswagen GTI -- 11-13-2009.jpg |thumb|right|200px|Mk5 GTI 5-door (US)]]
The Golf Mk5 '''GTI''' is hailed as a return-to-form for the progenitor of the genre.  The Golf GTI features a 2.0 litre [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[straight-4|inline 4-cylinder]] [[petrol engine]] with [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) direct-injection technology, which produces 200PS (147&nbsp;kW/197bhp). It is available in both 3-door and 5-door hatchback body shapes, and comes with a choice of either 6-speed manual or a 6-speed [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG) which greatly reduces [[shift time]] to only 8ms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paultan.org/archives/2006/06/26/vw-phases-out-automatics-makes-way-for-dsg/|title=Volkswagen makes way for DSG|accessdate=2006-08-11|publisher= Paul Tan}}</ref>

The concept GTI was first shown to the public at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in 2003.  The first production model was initially unveiled at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile]] in [[Paris]] in September 2004, and went on sale around the world shortly thereafter.  At the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006, the GTI made its long awaited [[North America]]n debut in 3-door guise (a 5-door variant has since become available), where it is marketed solely under the 'GTI' moniker, with no reference to the Rabbit.  The new GTI has a considerable price increase over the previous model, mainly due to the features mentioned above, and the fact that the exterior itself had not seen such a dramatic design change in years.  The price is further raised because it is built in Germany, unlike the Mk4 some of which were built in Brazil.  The innovative DSG transmission and the {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} TFSI engine all helped raise the retail price of the car.  The Mk5 GTI was named 2007 Automobile of the Year by ''Automobile Magazine'', in December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/awards/2007_all_stars/0702_2007_volkswagen_gti/index.html|title=2007 Automobile of the Year: 2007 Volkswagen GTI|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref>

==Special editions==
===Mk5 R32===
[[File:2nd Volkswagen R32.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|Golf Mk5 R32]]
In late September 2005, the Mk5 '''R32''' went on sale in Europe.  It features an updated 3.2-litre [[VR6 engine]] of that fitted to the previous Mk4 version, with an extra {{convert|10|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} courtesy of a reworked inlet manifold.  Maximum power is now {{convert|250|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,300&nbsp;rpm; [[torque]] is unchanged at {{convert|320|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.  It reaches an electronically-governed top speed of {{convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.  Going from 0 to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} will take 6.5 s, reduced to 6.2 s with the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]].

Compared with the previous Mk4 R32, it is 0.1 seconds faster for the manual version, while the newer R32 is about {{convert|40|kg|1|abbr=on}} heavier.  As with the previous R32; there is the [[Haldex Traction]]-based [[4motion]] part-time [[four-wheel drive]] through 18" Zolder 20-spoke alloy wheels.  Stopping the R32 comes in the form of blue-painted brake calipers with {{convert|345|mm|2|abbr=on}} discs at the front and {{convert|310|mm|2|abbr=on}} disks at the rear.

The Mk5 R32 was released in the US in August 2007.

===GTI Edition 30===
Following Volkswagen's successful 20th anniversary edition GTI (1996 in Europe, and 2003 for the North American market), and the 25th anniversary GTI (in 2001 for Europe only) models, Volkswagen marked the GTI's 30th anniversary by producing the '''GTI Edition 30'''.

Going on sale in November 2006 from £22,295 RRP, initially with a limited production run of only 1500 (Europe models), the Edition 30 was available in 6 colours; Tornado Red, Black, Candy White, Reflex Silver (Metallic), Steel Grey (Metallic) and finally Diamond Black (Pearl).  The changes over the standard production model included a modified engine that produced an extra {{convert|30|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on|lk=on}} more than the standard {{convert|200|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} version, raising the output to {{convert|230|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}}, giving rumour that it was faster in the dry and more powerful than the R32.  Slight changes to the body work included body coloured side skirts and Votex front spoiler, colour-keyed rear bumper and tinted rear lights from the R32.  Changes to the interior included a return for the golf ball shaped gear knob and silver "Edition 30" logo'd sill plates.  Edition 30 seats were also decked out in the distinctive red stitching on 'Vienna' leather and 'Interlagos' fabric mix.  Red stitching was also added to the leather-covered steering wheel.  Finally, dependent on the market and the options available the Edition 30 was available with 18" [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG|BBS]] originated 'Pescara' alloy wheels, or black versions of the 18" 'Monza II' alloy wheels.<ref>Pescara and Monza are labelled 'Rockingham' and 'Detroit' respectively in the German market, Volkswagen Deutschland, Volkswagen Golf GTI Edition 30 page, [http://www.volkswagen.de/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/de3/modelle/golf/golf0/ausstattungslinien/golf_gti_edition30.html ]. Retrieved 24 November 2007.</ref>

Performance was marginally improved: with 0-{{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} coming at 6.8 seconds (6.6 seconds for DSG-equipped models), and a top speed of {{convert|245|km/h|0|abbr=on}} (manual) or {{convert|243|km/h|0|abbr=on}} (DSG).<ref> Volkswagen manufacturer figures, Volkswagen UK, Volkswagen Golf GTI Edition 30 page [http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/new_cars/golf_gti30], accessed 24 Nov 07</ref>

===Fahrenheit Edition===
[[Image:VWGTIFahrenheit.JPG|thumb|25 0px|left|GTI Mark 5 Fahrenheit Edition (2007)]]
In October 2006, Volkswagen debuted a new '''Fahrenheit Edition''' of their GTI and GLI models at the [[Playboy Mansion]].  These new models were the first special-edition versions of the GTI and GLI made available in North America, and the first of the new models arrived in dealers in the early March 2007.

Fahrenheit models of the GTI were distinguished by their [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] Orange paint job, special Fahrenheit badging, a commemorative plate placed on the steering wheel, body-coloured interior panels, orange stitching on the DSG boot, steering wheel, park brake handle and floor mats (from which the red GTI logo had been removed), as well as special gunmetal-colored 18" "Charleston" wheels.  The Fahrenheit also came with a European tuned suspension.

The Fahrenheit GTI was available only with Volkswagen's [[Direct shift gearbox|DSG]] transmission.  Only 1200 Fahrenheit GTI models were produced for the US (150 in Canada) and 1,200 GLIs (not available in Canada).  US pricing started at $27,665.

===Speed Edition===
{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}

===Pirelli Edition===
This is a special edition GTI, developed by Volkswagen Individual. It was given the 230PS (169&nbsp;kW/226hp) Edition 30 engine, instead of the 200PS (147&nbsp;kW/197hp) in the standard Mk5 GTI.  It is equipped with 225/40R18 [[Pirelli]] P-Zero tyres on titanium colored alloy wheels.  It is available in 6-speed manual or an optional DSG gearbox.

It features leather sport seats in "San Remo” microfiber with embossed Pirelli tyre tread pattern down the centre. It also has yellow stitching on the seats, steering wheel and gear shift.  There is also a Pirelli logo on the steering wheel and head restraints.  The exterior and valences are painted sunflower yellow.<ref>Edmunds.com [http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=120846#4 Euro Sport: Volkswagen Golf GTI Pirelli] Date posted: 05-18-2007</ref><ref>Automobilemag.com [http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/0705_2008_volkswagen_golf_gti_pirelli/index.html 2008 Volkswagen Golf GTI Pirelli]</ref> Other colours are also available.

===GTI W12-650===

Volkswagen unveiled the '''GTI W12-650''' at the [[GTI Festival]] in [[Wörthersee]], [[Austria]], in May 2007.  It was designed as a [[concept car]] and only one is known to be in existence.  Unlike most concept cars, it is mechanically functional to the extent that it can be driven, however, due to the rushed build time of the car not all of its features are fully-functioning.  The steering-wheel mounted paddle-shifters are not linked to the transmission, the hazard lights are not functioning, and the heating and air-conditioning system of the car is not functioning due to the dashboard controls never being linked to the unit.

The car features a 6.00L [[W12 engine|W12]] bi-turbo engine from the [[Bentley Continental GT]] delivering {{convert|650|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|720|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}} in 3.7 seconds and a top speed of {{convert|202|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vw.co.uk/company/press/jun07_gtiw12|title=Volkswagen Golf GTI W12 Set To Make UK Debut}}</ref>.  Physically, the W12 differs from the standard GTI.  It is {{convert|70|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} lower and {{convert|160|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} wider, the rear seats have been removed to accommodate the [[mid-engine design]] and the roof is made from carbon-fibre. The W12-650 achieved a time of 1:29.6 on [[Top Gear (current format)|BBC Top Gear’s]] ''Power Lap'' feature.

==Concepts==
===TDI Hybrid===
A VW Golf TDI Hybrid concept was shown at the March 2008 [[Geneva motor show]].<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2008/03/04/geneva-2008-volkswagen-golf-tdi-hybrid-concept/ Geneva 2008: Volkswagen Golf TDI Hybrid Concept - Autoblog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The concept vehicle shown had a {{convert|74|hp}} three-cylinder TDI engine - probably the 1.4&nbsp;litre used in the [[Volkswagen Polo]] [[BlueMotion]] - mated to a {{convert|27|hp}} electric motor, and a seven-speed double-clutch DSG transmission.  The electric power system is a [[Nickel-metal hydride battery]] in the boot, and a regenerative braking system.  An "energy monitor" display on the dashboard keeps tabs on what the powertrain is doing, and provides both a stop/start capability and a full-electric mode at low speed.  The design also includes concepts introduced via BlueMotion, with smaller grill and thinner low-resistance tyres.  According to Germany's [[Auto Bild]], the car will get 69.9&nbsp;mpg, and emit 90&nbsp;g/km of carbon dioxide, less than the 104&nbsp;g/km emitted by the [[Toyota Prius]] and 116 emitted by the [[Honda Civic Hybrid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/03/revealed-volksw.html|title=Revealed: Volkswagen's 69.9-MPG Diesel Hybrid|author=Squatriglia, Chuck|publisher=Wired.com|date=2008-03-03|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref>  The TDI Hybrid is expected to be marketed in [[Europe]] from mid-2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/news/volkswagen-diesel-hybrid-pipe-dream.html|title=Volkswagen Diesel-Hybrid Golf, At What Price?|publisher=hybridcars.com|date=2008-02-29|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref>

===Twin Drive===
VW CEO [[Martin Winterkorn]] announced [[Volkswagen Golf Twin Drive]] [[plug-in hybrid vehicle]] based on Mark V Golf, which uses 2.0L 122hp turbodiesel and 82-hp electric motor with lithium-ion batteries.
