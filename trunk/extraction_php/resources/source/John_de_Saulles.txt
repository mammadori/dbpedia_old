'''John Gerard Longer de Saulles''' (b. 1879 – [[August 3]], [[1917]]) was a prominent [[United States|American]] athlete, [[Real estate broker]] and business man who was murdered by his millionaire wife, leading to a widely-reported trial.

==Early life==
John "Jack" de Saulles was born in [[South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], the son of Arthur Brice de Saulles and Catherine Heckscher. He became a star quarterback and captain of the [[Yale University]]'s varsity team of 1901, being chosen as the quarterback on the all-American team. In 1902 he was named Head Coach of the [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia Cavaliers football team]],<ref>[http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=globe&page=cfoot/teams/direct623.htm University of Virginia College Football Directory]</ref> where he compiled a 8-1-1 record. In 1911, he travelled to Chile as representative of the ''South American Concessions Syndicate'', a concern made up largely of Americans living in London, which was active in promoting the
Trans Andean Railroad, connecting the railway systems of Chile and Argentina. While there, the 32-years old De Saulles met 17-years old [[Chile]]an heiress [[Blanca Errázuriz]]. They were soon engaged and on [[December 14]], [[1911]] he married her at the English Church,<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B05EEDA1E31E233A25757C1A9649D946096D6CF New York Times, for December 14, 1911]</ref> in [[Paris]], [[France]].<ref>[http://newspapers.rawson.lib.mi.us/chronicle/ccc1912b%20(E)/issues/07-05-1912_5.pdf Cass City Chronicle, Cass City, Michigan, for July 5, 1912]</ref>

[[Image:BlancaDeSaulles.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Blanca Errázuriz]] and John De Saulles (1912)]]The married couple settled in [[New York City]], where he became a partner of real estate firm of ''Heckscher & de Saulles''. He participated very actively in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 presidential election]], where De Saulles organised 72,000 college men for [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]. In the campaign De Saulles and President Wilson became close friends, and he was rewarded with an appointment as ''US Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary'' to [[Paraguay]],<ref>[http://montevideo.usembassy.gov/usaweb/paginas/01-010EN.shtml Appointment as diplomat to Paraguay]</ref> but after the Senate had confirmed the appointment and even though he took the oath of office, he resigned before traveling to take up the post, preferring to concentrate on his real estate business and explaining that his business interests here made it impossible for him to accept.<ref>{{cite news

==Background==
===The divorce===
In 1915, Blanca Errázuriz befriended [[Rudolph Valentino]] in [[New York City]], where he was working as an exhibition dancer and had gained attention for his rendition of the Argentine [[tango (dance)|tango]], which was the craze at the time. Valentino enjoyed befriending many people of high society, and [[Blanca Errázuriz]] was unhappily married to De Saulles by whom she already had a son. Whether the two, Valentino and Errázuriz, actually had a romantic relationship is unknown, but Valentino was quite smitten with her so when Blanca was seeking a divorce from her husband, Valentino agreed to provide proof in court that Joan Sawyer, his dancing partner, was having an adulterous relationship with De Saulles; and took the stand to support Blanca's claim of John's well known infidelities.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> he used his political connections to have Valentino arrested along with a Mrs. Thyme, who was a known "madam", on [[vice]] charges (the exact charges are unknown). The evidence was flimsy at best (Valentino having been near the wrong place at the wrong time) and after a few days in jail, Valentino's bail was lowered from $10,000 to $1,500.<ref name="Leider, Emily W. p. 68-76">Leider, Emily W., ''Dark Lover: The life and death of Rudolph Valentino'', p. 68-76</ref> The scandal was well publicized along with the trial and Valentino felt degraded. No one would hire him and his old friends would no longer talk to him. Blanca seemed to not even thank him for his testimony.

===The murder===
[[Image:BlancaErrazuriz.jpg|thumb|200px||[[Blanca Errázuriz]] and son (1917)]]Shortly after the divorce, on [[August 3]], [[1917]], Blanca had herself driven from her home in [[Roslyn, New York]] to the ''The Box'', in Meadowbrook Colony, near [[Westbury, New York]]; home of her ex-husband. She had legal claims over the custody of their son, since she and her husband had been given shared-custody over him, but de Saulles refused to acknowledge the court's decision. She arrived at ''The Box'' shortly after 8 PM, and found de Saulles sitting in the porch of the house. They started to argue, and she pointed a gun at his head demanding he immediately hand over the child to her. When he tried to disarm her, she shot him five times.<ref>{{cite news

The widely-reported case went on for months, relegating the [[First World War]] that was raging in Europe to the inside pages of the newspapers. Blanca was defended by [[Henry Uterhart]], a noted criminalist of the time, and the principal witness for the defense was Suzanne Monteau, Blanca's French maid, who had accompanied her that night and completely supported her version of the facts.<ref>{{cite news

After the trial, he moved to [[Hollywood]],<ref name="Leider, Emily W. p. 68-76"/> where he started his successful movie career. Years later he tried to contact her again, but she would neither respond his calls or agree to see him. [[Blanca Errázuriz]] lived until 1940, when she committed suicide.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=April 2008}}
The case was the basis for the 1918 [[silent movie]] ''The woman and the Law'', directed by [[Raoul Walsh]]; with [[Jack Connors]], [[Miriam Cooper]] and [[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]]. The name ''De Saulles'' was changed to ''La Salle'' but the film's opening credits admit to being based on the story. Producer [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] wanted Miriam Cooper to play in the film, as she so closely resembled the woman she was to portray. According to Cooper, people on the street would mistake her for [[Blanca Errázuriz|Blanca De Saulles]]. Cooper fell ill when the film was to go into production, bowed out, and was replaced by another actress, who proved to be so terrible that Fox laid down the law with Cooper, telling her to make the film no matter how sick or how well she felt. It also helped that Raoul Walsh was her husband.
