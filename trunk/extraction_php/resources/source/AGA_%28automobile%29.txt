'''AGA''' was a German [[automobile]] company, once quite large, which manufactured its wares in Berlin from 1919 to 1929, and which by 1922 was manufacturing 1000 cars a month.  It was part of the [[Stinnes]] group of companies. AGA stood for Autogen Gasaccumulator AG, a company originally founded in 1914.

The first car, the '''Typ A''' of 1919 had a 1420&nbsp;[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] four-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] car.  The more successful '''Typ C''' followed in 1921 with the same engine but tuned to give more power and was sometimes used as a [[taxicab|taxi]].  After Hugo Stinnes died in 1924, AGA and its sister companies [[Dinos]], which was bought in 1925 to increase production space, and [[Rabag]] which was licensed to build [[Bugatti]] cars at the time, ran into difficulties.  Plans for a six cylinder model never reached the production stage. From 1926, production was severely curtailed and stopped completely in 1929 after about 8000 had been made.  

[[Willy Loge]] drove a '''6/30PS''' sports-racing version which had a 1490cc engine, and which won many races and was entered in the [[1926 German Grand Prix]].  Other racers also drove AGA cars.

The Swedish [[Thulin]] company made AGA cars under licence between 1920 and 1924.
