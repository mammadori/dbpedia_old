The '''Volkswagen GX3''' was a [[concept car]] created by project Moonraker, which was initiated by Stefan Liske, former director of group product strategy at [[Volkswagen]].  The GX3 was first shown at the 2006 [[Greater Los Angeles Auto Show]]. It was considered a very unusual concept since it was three-wheeled and sometimes considered more of a [[motorcycle]] concept than a concept [[automobile|car]]; but it did feature great performance for a projected cost of only about [[US$]]17,000.

The GX3 used a transverse-mounted 1.6&nbsp;L [[Straight-4|I4]] engine from the [[VW Lupo]] GTI.  This engine gave the GX3 an output of 125&nbsp;PS (92&nbsp;kW) and 152&nbsp;N·m (112&nbsp;ft·lbf) of torque.  The GX3 could go from 0–100&nbsp;km/h in 5.7 seconds and had a top speed of 200&nbsp;km/h (125&nbsp;mph).  It used a six-speed [[manual transmission]].

The design of the GX3 was atypical, with a front [[double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], tubular steel [[Space frame|spaceframe]] and laminated body panels.  The exterior design was one of a kind, with it being a two-seat, three-wheeled vehicle.  It lacked a roof or windshield, and was intended mainly for fair-weather environments, as a "weekend car".  The design of the interior was very minimalist and entirely functional.

There was considerable speculation as to possible production of the GX3; Volkswagen fueled this with the announcement that production would depend on the public reaction to the concept.  However, in spite of the energetic and overwhelmingly positive public response to the concept, and intensive chassis development by [[Lotus Cars]] for production, Volkswagen later concluded that it would not be able to sell the GX3 without costly and complex redesigns that would alienate VW's target market and increase price above the proposed [[US$]]17,000 base price.  The company cited possible safety issues that could lead to product-liability lawsuits and decided that the legal concerns made production as-is impossible.
