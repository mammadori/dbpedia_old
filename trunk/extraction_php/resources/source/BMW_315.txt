The '''BMW 315''' was a middle sized [[sedan (car)|saloon]] produced by [[BMW]] from 1934 to 1937.<ref name=Norbye250 />  It was based on the [[BMW 303]].  It differed from the 303 mainly with its larger engine, with increases in both the bore (to {{convert|58|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} from {{convert|56|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}) and the stroke (to {{convert|94|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} from {{convert|80|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}).<ref name=Norbye39_40 /><ref name=Norbye33_36>Norbye, pp. 33-36</ref>

A total of 9,765 BMW 315s were built, including two-door saloon cars, touring cars, convertibles, sport convertibles, and 315/1 roadsters.<ref name=Norbye250 />

The '''BMW 315/1''' was a [[sports car]] based on the 315 saloon.  It used the same chassis as the 315 saloon and had an engine of the same displacement.  However, with compression ratio increased to 6.8:1<ref name=Norbye39_40 /><ref name=Carfolio315_1 /> from 5.6:1 in the saloon<ref name=Carfolio315 /><ref name=Norbye33_36 />, and with the use of three Solex carburetors<ref name=Norbye39_40 /><ref name=Carfolio315_1 />, power increased to {{convert|40.6|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 4300 rpm, while the [[roadster]] bodywork reduced kerb weight to {{convert|750|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=Carfolio315_1 />.

Production of the 315/1 ended in 1936. 242 examples were built.<ref name=bmwccn.no_315_1 />  

== BMW 319 and 319/1 ==

The BMW 319 and 319/1 were introduced in 1935. They differed from the 315 and 315/1 mainly in that the dimensions of the engines were increased.  The new, larger engine had a bore of {{convert|65|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and a stroke of {{convert|96|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, resulting in a displacement of {{convert|1911|cc|CID|1|abbr=on}}.  This resulted in an increase in power to {{convert|45|bhp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 3750 rpm in the base 319 and {{convert|55|bhp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm in the 319/1 roadster<ref name=Norbye44>Norbye, p.44</ref> The kerb weight of the 319 was {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the fuel capacity was {{convert|40|L|USgal impgal|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Carfolio319>Carfolio.com: 1935 BMW 319 Saloon</ref>

A total of 6,646 BMW 319s of all types were built by the end of production in 1937.<ref name=Norbye250 /> 102 of these were 319/1 roadsters.<ref name=bmwccn.no_315_1 />

== BMW 329 ==
The '''BMW 329''' replaced the BMW 319 in early 1937.  The 329 was basically a 319 with the front bodywork and fenders from the [[BMW 326]].  The 329 was available only as a convertible, with either two or four doors.  The 329 was replaced by the 326-based [[BMW 320]] later in 1937.<ref name=Norbye47>Norbye, p.47</ref>
