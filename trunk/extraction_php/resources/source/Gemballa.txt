'''Gemballa''' is a company based in [[Leonberg]] near [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], which was founded by, and named after, [[Uwe Gemballa]] in 1981.

They provide aftermarket parts mainly for [[Porsche]]. 

A {{convert|600|hp|abbr=on}} car held the [[Nordschleife fastest lap times|lap record]] for road cars at the [[Nürburgring]] in the late 1990s once, and again in 2001 when [[Wolfgang Kaufmann]] lowered it to 7:32,52 min. It was since beaten by a [[Porsche Carrera GT]], by less than a second.

Mirage GT - Based on Porsche's [[Carrera GT]]. Rumors suggested that when the car was produced it would have upwards of {{convert|800|hp}}; however, the Mirage GT's only performance modification is an exhaust system which boosts power to {{convert|645|hp|abbr=on}}. Company owner Uwe Gemballa says a twin-turbo version of the Porsche Supercar is in the works. [[Modified Luxury & Exotics]] magazine described the unveiling of the car as, "one of the most highly anticipated moments the aftermarket has been witness to." They concluded by saying that, "It goes without saying that the Gemballa Mirage GT is one of the finest automobiles we've ever featured."

Gemballa Avalanche GTR800 EVO-R is a car based on the current 911 (997) GT2. Like the title suggests, this hypercar produces about {{convert|800|bhp|abbr=on}} thanks to two turbochargers and highly modified engine components. Not much information is available at the moment but there are some pictures released at [http://www.gemballa.com www.gemballa.com], the Gemballa website.

Gemballa also has a modification based on the [[Porsche Cayenne|Porsche 957 Cayenne Turbo]]. This produces around 750 brake horsepower. The modification is called GT 750 Aero 3. This modification is also available for the Cayenne's predecessor 955 turbo. The tune-up kit features exterior modification to enhance aerodynamic performance. Engine tuning is carried through revised turbochargers, coolers (oil and pressurized air IC) and a large collection of engine components including pistons and seals.
