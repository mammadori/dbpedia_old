The '''Volkswagen Microbus Concept Car''' (also known as the '''Volkswagen New Microbus''' and '''Volkswagen Microbus Concept''') was a [[concept car]] recalling the original [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen Microbus]] and first presented at the 2001 [[North American International Auto Show]].

The new Microbus was completely modern compared to its predecessor, featuring a 7-inch screen in the center console and a second ceiling-located 7-inch screen that allowed the driver to see behind the vehicle.

In June 2002 Volkswagen announced that the Microbus, using the platform of the forthcoming [[Volkswagen Transporter (T5)|T5 light van]], was scheduled for production commencing during 2003 at the company's [[Hanover]] plant, ramping up to 80,000 units annually by 2005<ref name=AutoMotorundSport200214>{{cite journal| authorlink = Bernd Ostmann  (Ed)| title =Neues vom Auto: VW baut den neuen Microbus is Hannover| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = 2002 Heft 14| pages = Seite 12|date = date 26 June 2002}}</ref>.   The launch was deferred, however, and the project was formally canceled in early 2005.  In 2005, VW instead announced that Chrysler would build minivans for Volkswagen in the United States, while in Europe the [[Volkswagen Transporter (T5)#People Movers - Kombi to Multivan|VW Transporter Multivan]] would fill the niche previously intended for the reborn Microbus.

The Chrysler built [[Volkswagen Routan]] was released to the North American market in September 2008. Unrelated to the new Microbus, the Routan is a seven-seat [[minivan]] and is a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant of the [[Chrysler RT platform]], fifth-generation [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] and [[Chrysler Town & Country]].<ref name="ablog">{{cite web
