[[Image:BMW Concept 7Series ActiveHybrid.JPG|thumb|200px|right|BMW Concept 7 Series ActiveHybrid]]The BMW Concept 7 Series ActiveHybrid is the concept vehicle of BMWs first mild-hybrid and was revealed at the Paris Motor Show in October 2008. It is the second Hybrid concept vehicle of [[BMW]]: The [[BMW Concept X6 ActiveHybrid]] – BMWs first full hybrid – was revealed at the IAA Frankfurt in September 2007. Both models will be ready for serial production at the end of 2009. 

The BMW Concept 7 Series ActiveHybrid combines an engine based on the High Precision Injection V8 Twin Turbo unit used in the BMW 750i (where it delivers 300 kW/407 hp) with an electric motor that is only designed to provide support to the internal combustion engine. The electric motor is integrated between transmission and engine and provides 15 kW of power and 210 Nm of torque. In this so-called mild hybrid configuration, the electric motor increases the potential of the eight-cylinder petrol engine while using Brake Energy Regeneration – mostly in urban traffic – to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
