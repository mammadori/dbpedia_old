[[Image:Lamborghini350GTV12-engine.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The original [[Lamborghini]] [[V12 engine]] used in the [[Lamborghini 350GT|350GT]].  Note the six twin-barrel side-draught [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] 40 DCOE 2 carburettors.]]
The '''Lamborghini V12''' is a [[V12 engine]] designed by [[Lamborghini]], and was the first [[internal combustion engine|engine]] ever produced by the firm.

It first entered production in 1963, in {{convert|3464|cc|1|lk=on}} (3.5&nbsp;[[litre]]) form in the [[Lamborghini 350GT]], the first car ever produced by the [[automotive industry|carmaker]].  The latest 6.5&nbsp;litre version is used in the current [[Lamborghini Murciélago]] LP640 Coupé and Roadster.

==History==
[[Image:Wikilamjareng.jpg|200px|thumb|left|An early [[Lamborghini]] [[V12 engine]] used in the [[Lamborghini Espada|Espada]] and [[Lamborghini Jarama|Jarama]]]]
There are many versions of the story of its development - some (notably [[L.J.K. Setright]<ref>"Supercar Classics" magazine, Spring 1986</ref>]) say it is derived from a [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] [[Formula One]] design, others{{who|date=August 2009}} say that [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] borrowed heavily from his own F1 design.  Both were 1.5&nbsp;litre V12 [[auto racing|racing]] engines, and the Lamborghini unit has similarities to both.

In any case, when [[Ferruccio Lamborghini]] set out to provide [[Ferrari]] with competition, he contracted Bizzarrini to design the engine for his car and, according to some accounts, paid him a bonus for every [[horsepower]] over what Ferrari's V12 could produce.  The finished product was such that, with minor modifications and improvements, the very same engine (in 6.5&nbsp;litre form) powers the current V12-engined [[Lamborghini Murciélago#LP640|Lamborghini Murciélago LP640]], and is estimated to finish its service for Lamborghini with the coming version of the Murcielago, the [[Lamborghini Murciélago#Murciélago SV|Murciélago SV]].<ref name="ddavid.com">{{cite web|title=Lighter Murcielago here in 2008|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/229128/|work=Autocar.co.uk|publisher=© Haymarket Media Group 2009|date=9 November 2007|accessdate=30 August 2009}}</ref>

==Technical overview==
Quad cam - 2x[[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshaft]] (2xDOHC - two [[overhead camshaft]]s per [[cylinder bank]]) 60° V12 - as an intentional snub by 
Mr. Lamborghini of Ferrari's single-cam per-bank design (2x&nbsp;[[overhead camshaft#single overhead camshaft|single overhead camshaft]] - 2xSOHC).  When the {{convert|3464|cc|1|abbr=on}} prototype was tested in [[1963]], it was able to produce {{convert|370|bhp|kW PS|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} at 9,000&nbsp;rpm - a figure of almost {{convert|107|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} per litre, and unprecedented at the time.  Bizzarrini famously insisted that the engine was mechanically capable of reaching an astonishing {{convert|400|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 11,000&nbsp;rpm with an uprated fuel system, but the design was judged adequate, and when fitted with production [[carburettor]]s, all the auxiliary systems, and detuned for road use, the engine still made an impressive {{convert|280|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

==Audi ownership==
[[Image:Lamborghini Murciélago with engine.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Lamborghini]] [[Lamborghini Murciélago|Murciélago LP640 Roadster]] with its [[V12 engine]]]]
Over the years, notably since Lamborghini was purchased by [[Volkswagen Group]] subsidiary [[Audi|Audi AG]], the engine has nearly doubled in [[engine displacement|displacement]] - first to {{convert|6192|cc|1|lk=on}}, and later to {{convert|6496|cc|1}}.  It has seen the modification of the [[cylinder head]]s to allow [[multi-valve|four valves]] per cylinder, the replacement of [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] carburettors with [[fuel injection#typical EFI components|electronic fuel injection]], and the re-engineering of the [[motor oil|lubrication]] system from a [[wet sump]] to a [[dry sump]] design.  However, the engine that powers the current [[Lamborghini Murciélago|Murciélago]] LP640 can trace its lineage directly to the F1-inspired design of Bizzarrini and his team more than forty years ago.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}
