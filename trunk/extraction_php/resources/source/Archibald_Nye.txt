[[Lieutenant General (UK)|Lieutenant-General]] '''Sir Archibald Edward Nye''', [[Order of the Star of India|GCSI]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|GCIE]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (23 April 1895 - 13 December 1967) was a [[British Army]] officer who served in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the latter he served as [[List_of_senior_officers_of_the_British_Army#Vice_Chiefs_of_the_Imperial_General_Staff|Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff]].

After World War II he served as [[List of Governors of Madras|Governor of Madras]] - after which appointment [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] asked for him to stay on as [[High Commissioner]] in India.<ref>Alanbrooke (2001), p. xli.</ref> He subsequently served as High Commissioner to Canada.

== Early life ==
Archibald Edward Nye was born on April 23, 1895 at Shipstreet Barracks, Dublin, to Charles Edward Nye and Mary Sexton. He was the second of three sons born to the couple who also had three daughters. Charles Edward Nye was a [[regimental sergeant major]] in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. 

Nye was educated at the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]] after the death of his father and desired to become a [[schoolmaster]]. But the [[First World War]] broke out at this juncture and Nye joined the army.

== Army service ==
Nye went to [[France]] with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in 1914 serving as an [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]. In 1915, he was selected for a commission in the [[Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment|Prince of Wales' Leinster Regiment]]. Nye was wounded twice in action during the First World War. He was awarded the Military Cross for bravery.<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=31266 |linkeddate=1919-04-01 |startpage=4331 |endpage= |supp=y |accessdate=2009-09-20 }}</ref> The official citation for this ward reads:{{quote|For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on 20th October, 1918 near Esscher. He made a reconnaissance, under heavy shell and machine-gun fire, of the forward positions along the whole battalion front adjusting a portion on his own initiative to complete the line. He was of great assistance to his commanding officer throughout the week's fighting.<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/31680/supplements/15358 London Gazette]</ref>.}}

When the Leinster Regiment was disbanded, Nye was transferred to the [[Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers|Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] with a regular commission. Between the world wars he had a number of regimental appointments and attended the staff officer's course at Staff College, Camberley in 1924-25 which he successfully completed. In 1932, he completed his graduation in law and qualified as a barrister at the Inner Temple. From late 1937 to 1939 he commanded the 2nd battalion of his regiment, by this time renamed the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers.

In 1939 he was sent to [[India]] to raise a [[brigade]] and commanded the Nowshera Brigade from May 1939 to January 1940. In February 1940 he returned to London to take up the post of Deputy Director of Staff Duties, [[War Office]] and became Director of Staff Duties and an acting [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major-general]] that October. In December 1941, he became [[List of senior officers of the British Army|Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] and an acting [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]] (the rank of major-general had been permanent in November 1941). His most important function in this role was to represent the CIGS, [[Alan Brooke]], when he was unable to attend one of the many committees on which he sat such as the Chiefs of Staff Committee, the Defence Committee (Operations), the War Cabinet and the Army Council. The enormous burdens placed on Brooke meant that he needed to delegate many of his tasks and for this he relied heavily on Nye. The partnership was highly successful and Nye remained in the job for the rest of the war.<ref>Mead, p. 330.</ref> It could be said that while Brooke ran the war, Nye ran the army.<ref>Mead, p. 328.</ref> His rank of lieutenant-general was made substantive in September 1944.

== Governor of Madras ==

Nye was appointed Governor of Madras on February 26, 1946<ref name="march">{{cite book|title=March to freedom in Madras Presidency, 1916-1947|author=Saroja Sundarrajan|page=632|publisher=Lalitha Publications|year=1989}}</ref> and took charge on May 5, 1946<ref name="worldstatemen_british india">{{cite web|title=Provinces of British India - Madras|publisher=worldstatesmen|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_BrProvinces.htm#Madras}}</ref> and served as Governor till September 7, 1948.<ref name="wordlstatesmen">{{cite web|title=Indian States since 1947 - Tamil Nadu|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_states.html#Tamil-Nadu|publisher=worldstatesmen}}</ref> The day prior to his appointment as Governor there was a major labour strike in Madras.<ref name="march" /> The rest of his term was plagued by peasant uprisings all over the province.<ref name="struggle_asia">{{cite book|title=Struggle for Asia|page=96|author=Sir Francis Low|year=1972}}</ref> These rebellions were aided and abetted by the Communists who established miniature governments along the northern frontiers of the Presidency thereby demanding military action.<ref name="struggle_asia" /> Nye attributed their success to the "zeal and energy of young men who conducted their own newspapers and who preached the creed of expropriating landlords and distributing their land to needy and hungry labourers".<ref name="struggle_asia" />  Nye was also the Colonel-in-chief of the Madras Regiment from August 10, 1946 to March 31, 1949.<ref name="madrasregiment">{{cite web|title=Madras Regiment|publisher=Indian Army|url=http://indianarmy.nic.in/infantry/inf_mds.html}}</ref> The Recruits Training Centre was moved from [[Madukkarai]] near [[Coimbatore]] to [[Wellington, Tamil Nadu|Wellington]] in February 1947.<ref name="madrasregiment" /> Nye inaugurated the Madras offices of the [[British Council]] in July-August 1948.<ref name="thehindu_britishcouncil">{{cite news|title=Recalling the beginnings|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2005/03/21/stories/2005032100130300.htm|date=March 21, 2005|work=[[The Hindu]]|author=S.

Nye was strongly critical of Britain's efforts to admit India into the [[British Commonwealth]].<ref name="partitionofindiap81">{{cite book|title=Partition of India and Mountbatten|page=81|publisher=Atlantic Publisher and Distributors}}</ref> He felt that from the defence point of view, Indian would be "an ailing child who has literally, nothing, whatever to offer but who, on the other hand, constitutes a grave liability".<ref name="partitionofindiap81" />

Nye was honoured with the [[Order of the Indian Empire|GCIE]] in 1946 and the [[Order of the Star of India|GCSI]] in 1947.
