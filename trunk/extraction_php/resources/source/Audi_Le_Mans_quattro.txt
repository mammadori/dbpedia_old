The '''Audi Le Mans quattro''' was a [[sports car]] styled [[concept car]], developed by [[Audi]], for presentation at the 2003 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], as a result of Audi's three successive wins at the arduous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] endurance motor race in 2000, 2001, and 2002.  It was the third and final concept car designed by [[Audi]] in 2003, following the [[Audi Pikes Peak quattro|Pikes Peak quattro]] and [[Audi Nuvolari quattro|Nuvolari quattro]].<ref>{{PDF|[http://www.audi.com/etc/medialib/cms4imp/audi2/company/financial_information/pdf.Par.0103.File.pdf Audi 2003 Product Strategy - indicating Le Mans quattro detail (p.13)]|1.50&nbsp;MB}} - </ref><ref name="car-reviews.automobile.com">{{Cite web|url=http://car-reviews.automobile.com/Audi/concept/2003-audi-le-mans-quattro-concept/634/|title=2003 Audi Le Mans quattro Concept|accessdate=2008-06-03|work=car-reviews.automobile.com}}</ref>

Audi subsidiary [[quattro GmbH]] subsequently decided to produce the Audi Le Mans quattro as a production road car, calling it the [[Audi R8]], naming it after their very successful [[Audi R8 (race car)]] which won the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] five times.

==Design and technical==
The Audi Le Mans Quattro has a number of high-tech features, including the [[headlamp|headlights]] which are composed entirely of [[light-emitting diodes]] (LEDs). The structural framework of the body, the [[Space frame|Audi Space Frame]] (ASF) used in the [[Lamborghini]] [[Lamborghini Gallardo|Gallardo]], is made entirely of [[aluminium]], while the outer skin is made out of [[carbon fiber|carbon fibre]] and aluminium. The car also features an automatic rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] which raises at {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

The Le Mans quattro featured the [[magneto rheological damper]]s, also installed in the latest [[Audi TT]], which gives the car a firmer and more responsive drive and improved handling characteristics. In Audi tradition, the car features [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] to optimise traction and handling.

The Le Mans quattro's engine was a development of the [[Lamborghini Gallardo|Gallardo]]'s, with the same displacement but utilizing different [[cylinder head]]s (with four valves per cylinder rather than five), as well as [[twin-turbo]]chargers and [[Gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) technology, resulting in the high output of {{convert|449|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|750|Nm|ft.lbf|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} of torque. The [[transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] is the six-speed [[sequential manual transmission]] used in the Gallardo.

The car showcased various Audi styling cues and technological details, planned to be used in future production Audis.

==Specifications==
*Power: {{convert|449|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}
