The '''BMW M12/13 turbo''' 1500&nbsp;cc 4-cylinder [[turbocharged]] [[Formula One]] motor, based on the standard [[BMW M10]] engine introduced in 1961, powered the F1 cars of [[Brabham]], [[Arrows]] and [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] and won the world championship in 1983.

As BMW M12, the engine design since the 1960s became one of the most successful engines in racing. Starting with the [[European Touring Car Championship]], it was also used in [[Formula 2]], expanded to two litre and fitted with four-valve heads, producing over {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. In the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]], a 1400 cc variant (with a 1.4 handicap factor equal to 2000cc) was turbocharged by [[Paul Rosche]] according to FIA [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] rules. At well over {{convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from the beginning, it rendered the normally aspirated engines in the two liter category useless. After some development, power, driveability and reliability improved, especially in the [[IMSA]] car, and BMW began to think about entering F1, where a handicap factor of 2.0 required 1500 cc engines.

In the years 1986 and 1987, the version ''M12/13/1'' was tilted sideways by 72° for use in the extremely low [[Brabham BT55]]. The design was not successful, probably due to cooling issues in the tight compartement. Anyway, the 1986 engine was said to produce about {{convert|1300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in qualifying.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

As BMW announced to pull out officially at the end of 1986, the [[Arrows]] team brokered a deal with support from its primary sponsor, [[USF&G]], to continue the use of the upright BMW engines under the name of its subsidiary ''Megatron, Inc.'', founded by long-time F1 aficionado John J. Schmidt, who coined the phrase ''"Horse racing may have been the sport of kings, but auto racing is the sport of corporations"''. The engines were serviced by [[Heini Mader]] from Switzerland, the former mechanic of [[Jo Siffert]].

Rebadged as ''Megatron'', the BMW engines were used by the [[Arrows]] team for the [[1987 Formula One season|1987]] and [[1988 Formula One season|1988]] seasons, as well as [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] for 1987 only.

The Megatron programme ended as a result of a change of Formula 1 engine rules which banned turbocharged motors at the end of 1988. The Arrows team reverted to using 3500&nbsp;cc Ford-Cosworth V8 [[normally aspirated]] powerplants for the [[1989 Formula One season|1989]] season.
