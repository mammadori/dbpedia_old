Despite the BMW TwinPower Turbo brand name used for the N55, it uses a single turbocharger with twin scroll technology, taking in exhaust pulses from two groups of 3 cylinders. Valvetronic is used to help reduce throttle losses. By contrast, other engines carrying the TwinPower Turbo moniker have twin turbochargers. The preceding [[BMW N54|N54]] was a twin-turbocharged [[straight-6]] that did not use Valvetronic.
