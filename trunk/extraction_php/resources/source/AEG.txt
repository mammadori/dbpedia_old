'''''Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft''''' ('''AEG''') (''literally'' General Electricity Company) is a German producer of electrical equipment founded in 1883 by [[Emil Rathenau]].

AEG was the first to introduce a complete brand - logo, design and corporate identity - which was created by the architect/designer [[Peter Behrens]].

In 1967 '''AEG''' joined with [[Telefunken]] creating '''AEG-Telefunken'''. In 1985 AEG was bought by [[Daimler-Benz]], later being wholly integrated into [[DaimlerChrysler]] forming part of [[AdTranz]]. By 1997 the company no longer existed. 

In 2005 [[Electrolux]] bought the brand name and now trades using the brand AEG-Electrolux. As of 2009 the '''AEG''' name is also licensed to various companies.

==History==
===Summary===
[[File:Lauffen-Frankfurt 1891a.jpg|thumb|Artificial electrically powered water fall at the [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891]].]]
'''AEG''' was created in 1887 from the '''''Deutsche Edison Gesellschaft''''' ('''''DEG'''''), initially the company produced electrical equipment - light bulbs, motors and generators etc., it soon became involved in AC electrical tranmission systems. In 1907 [[Peter Behrens]] was appointed as artistic consultant to AEG, an event which brought about the creation of the worlds first [[corporate identity]], with products and advertising sharing common design features - all linked to the company name AEG.<ref>[http://www.aeg.com/node367.asp The Father of Industrial Design] ''aeg.com''</ref>

The company expanded in the first half of the 20th Century and is credited with a number of firsts and inventions in the electrical engineering field. During the same period it entered the automobile and airplane markets. Electrical equipment for railways was also produced during this time - starting a long history of supplying the German railways with electrical equipment.

After the black period of the Second World War the company lost those businesses located in the eastern part of Germany. In 1967, after a merger, the company was renamed '''AEG Telefunken'''. The company experienced financial difficulties during the 1970s resulting in the sale of some of its assets; in 1983 the consumer electronics division was sold and the company re-took the name '''AEG'''. In 1985 the remainder of the company was acquired by [[Daimler-Benz]]; the parts that remained were primarily related to electric power distribution, and electric motor technology. Under Daimler Benz ownership the former AEG rump companies eventually become part of the newly named [[Adtranz]] in 1995. In 1996 '''AEG''' as a manufacturing company ceased to exist.The Agent in Iran is Parmida Avaran AXON.

===Time line - from foundation to 1940===
[[File:SchreibmaschineAEG Mignon.JPG|thumb|AEG Early typewriter.]]
The origins of the company can be traced to 1882, when [[Emil Rathenau]] who had acquired licences to use some of [[Thomas Edison]]s lamp patents in Germany<ref group="chron">Timeline 1882</ref>. The '''''Deutsche Edison Gesellschaft''''' ('''''DEG''''') (literal: German Edison Company) was founded in 1883 with the financial backing of various banks and private individuals, with Emil Rathenau as company director<ref group="chron">Timeline 1883</ref>.

In 1884 the Munich born  engineer [[Oskar von Miller]] (who later became the founder of the [[Deutsches Museum]]) joins the executive board. The same year the company enters negotiations with the Berlin ''Magistrat'' (the municipal body) to supply a large area from a central supply, which successfully result in the formation of the ''Städtische Elektricitäts-Werke AG zu Berlin'' (AGStEW)<ref>After 1887 called the ''Berliner Elektricitäts-Werke'' (BEW)</ref> (''literal'': City electricity works company (berlin)) on the 8th of May 1884 - this date is considered to be the birthday of the German electrical industry.<ref group="chron">Timeline 1884</ref>

The original factory was located near [[Berlin Nordbahnhof]] (then named Stettin bahnhof). In 1887, the Company acquired land in the [[Berlin-Gesundbrunnen]] area on which the ''Weddingsche Maschinenfabrik'' (founded by [[Wilhelm Wedding]]) was previously located{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. In the same year, in addition to a restructuring and expansion of the production range the name '''AEG''' was adopted.<ref group="chron">Timeline 1885-1887</ref>

In 1887 [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky|Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrowolsky]] joined the company as chief engineer, later becoming vice-director. His work on rotary power, building on the work of [[Nikolai Tesla]], led to the first practical application of an AC motor in the world.<ref group="chron">Timeline 1888-1889</ref>

In 1891 Miller and Dobrovolski succeeded in demonstrating the transmission of electrical power over a distance of 175&nbsp;km from a hydro electric power plant in [[Lauffen am Neckar]] to [[Frankfurt]], where it lit 1000 light bulbs and drove an artificial waterfall - at the [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891|International Electrotechnical Exhibition]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This success marked one of beginnings of the general use of alternating current for electrification in Germany, and showed that distance transfer of electrical power could useful economically. Additionally, in the same year the ''Stadtbahn Halle/Saale'' (City railway Halle - Saale) is opened - being the first electric tram system (of notable size) in Germany<ref group="chron">Timeline 1890-1891</ref>

[[Tropp Paul]] began his work for the AEG 1889/90 until 1893, and [[Franz Heinrich Schwechten|Franz Schwechten]] designed the facades of the ''Acker- und Hussitenstraße'' 1894-95.

In 1894 the site of the former ''Berlin Viehmarktgasse'' (cattle market) was purchased. This had a siding connecting to the Berlin rail network produced, but there was no rail connection between the two plants - therefore in 1895 a link between the two plots was built as an underground railway in a specially designed tunnel of 270 meters in length. The tunnel was implemented by Siemens & Halske (S & H) (later to become [[Siemens]]) under the direction of [[C. Schwebel]] and [[Wilhelm Lauter]] - this is now the [[Spree tunnel Stralau]] - used by public transport.

In 1903 the competing radio companies of AEG with and of ''Siemens & Halkse'' are merged forming a joint subisdary company with the name [[Telefunken]].<ref name="y1903" group="chron">Timeline 1903</ref>

In 1907 the architect [[Peter Behrens]] became an artistic adviser<ref group="chron">Timeline 1904-1907</ref>. Responsible for the design of all products, advertising and architecture, he has since become considered as the world's first corporate designer.

The activity of the company soon extended to all areas of electrical power engineering, in particular to electric lighting, electric power, electric railways, electro-chemical plants, as well as the construction of steam turbines, automobiles, cables and cable materials. In the first decades, the company had many factories in and around Berlin: 

On the 20th June 1915 the founder, Emil Rathenau dies aged 77.<ref group="chron">Timeline 1915-1916</ref>

===The Nazi era and World War II===
{{Expand-section|date=March 2009}}
Documents show that AEG donated 60,000 Reichsmarks to the Nazi party after the [[Secret Meeting of 20 February 1933]] at which the twin goals of complete power and national rearmament were explained by Hitler.<ref>''The Mazal Library'': [http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/07/NMT07-T0567.htm NMT, Volume VII, pp. 567] (Document NI-391 pages 565–568), [http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/07/NMT07-C001.htm The Farben Case]</ref><ref name = "kuehnl">''The Mazal Library'': [http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/07/NMT07-T0557.htm NMT, Volume VII, pp. 557] (Document D-203 pages 557-562), [http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/07/NMT07-C001.htm The Farben Case]</ref>

During [[World War II]], an AEG factory near [[Riga]] used female slave labour.<ref>[http://www.theverylongview.com/WATH/generation/generation1.htm From generation to generation - My great grandmother] Personal testiment of holocaust survivor. ''theverylongview.com''</ref> AEG were also contracted for the production of electrical equipment at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].<ref>[http://www.holocaustsurvivors.org/data.show.php?di=record&da=encyclopedia&ke=8 Holocaust survivors - encyclopedia: Auschwitz] ''holocaustsurvivors.org''</ref>

===1945 to 1970===
In 1945, after the Second World War, the production in the factories in the western sectors of [[Berlin]] and [[Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Mulheim an der Ruhr]] resumed and further new works were erected, among others an [[Electric meter]] plant in [[Hameln]].

The steam and electric locomotive plant in [[Hennigsdorf]] (''Fabriken Hennigsdorf'') became a ''[[Volkseigener Betrieb]]'' (VEB) (people owned enterprise) as the ''[[Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke]]'' (LEW) (literal: electric locomotive works). The cable plant (''Draht-, Kabel- und Metallwerk Oberspree'') and apparatus factory (''Apparatefabrik Treptow'') and other facilities also lay in East Germany and became ''[[Sowjetische Aktiengesellschaft]]'' (SAG) (Soviet joint stock companies). Over 90% of assets in Berlin lay in the Russian occupied zone and were lost.<ref name="war">[http://www.gerdflaig.de/AEG_Geschichte/AEG1950.htm Firmengeschichte der AEG  1941/50 ] History of AEG 1941-1950 (more details of post war losses and problems) ''gerflaig.de''</ref>

The headquarters for the non-expropriated parts of the company were moved first to Hamburg and then finally to [[Frankfurt am Main]], the headquarters in Berlin having been destroyed.<ref name="war"/>
 
*1950 -  The new corporate headquarters are at the ''Friedensbrücke'' (Peace Bridge) in Frankfurt / Main. The number of employees in the Group rose from 20,900 in September 1948 to 55,400 persons in September 1957. In the same year the turnover exceeded one billion DM for the first time, however the high level of investment in the rebuilding of the company (1948 to 1956 over 500 million DM) placed a considerable strain on the balance sheet.
*1958 The slogan  "Aus Erfahrung Gut" is introduced  - resulting in vernacular modifications such as "Auspacken, Einschalten, Geht nicht" - (unpacking, switching on, does not work) or "Alles Ein Gammel" (Everything is '[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gammy gammy]') 
*1962 The Group has 127,000 employees and generates annual sales of 3.1 billion DM. In [[Springe]] a new factory is opened in February 1962 a new factory for the production of fluid control units with 200 employees. 
*1962 [[Walter Bruch]] at Telefunken in Hannover develops PAL TV color. 
*1966 The largest industrial space in Europe is created (175 m long, 45 meters wide and 26 meters high) for the construction using cranes of engines and generators with weights up to 400 tonnes. [[Robert Kennedy]] attends the opening.
*1 January 1967 - Merger with Telefunken creates '''AEG-Telefunken''', headquartered in Frankfurt am Main.

===1970s onwards===
[[File:Typenschild-Doppelt gespeiste Asynchronmaschine Apel.jpg|thumb|AEG electric motor builders plate.]]
*In 1970 '''AEG-Telefunken''' has 178,000 employees worldwide and is the twelfth largest electrical company in the world. However the company is burdened by, among other things, ultimately unsuccessful projects, such as the construction of an automated baggage conveyor system at [[Frankfurt Airport]] and its entrance into the nuclear power plants building business. The companies' line of [[Boiling water reactor]]s were not successful on the market. In particular, the nuclear power plant at [[Würgassen]], the commissioning of which was delayed by several years due to a number of technical problems cost AEG hundreds of millions of DM. 
*In 1972 The company stock provided a dividend from the last time. The entertainment arm (''Telefunken Fernseh und Rundfunk GmbH'') headquartered in [[Hanover]] is sold outsourced. Next is computer technology: the mainframe business (TR 4, TR 10, TR 440) (a partnership under the name Telefunken Computer GmbH with the company [[Nixdorf]] is sold to Siemens. The process computer (TR 84, TR 86, AEG 60-10, AEG 80-20, AEG 80-60) continues as ''Geschäftsbereich Automatisierungstechnik'' (after 1980 as ATM Computer GmbH)
*1975 The former Telefunken building at Berlin Ernst-Reuter-Platz is sold.  The building was previously rented to the [[Technical University of Berlin]]
*1976 To circumvent the equal participation of employees in the Supervisory Board, Dr. Walter Cipa (Dipl.-Geol.) (AEG boss from 1976 to 1980) creates four further companies are created as wholly owned [[joint stock companies]] in addition to the two household appliance companies: (The numbers in brackets refer to percentage of turnover in 1980) 
:AEG-Telefunken Anlagentechnik AG (37 %) 
:AEG-Telefunken Serienprodukte AG (16 %) 
:AEG-Telefunken Kommunikationstechnik AG (6 %)  
:Olympia Werke AG (business office technology, 7%) 
:AEG-Hausgeräte GmbH (22 %) 
:Telefunken Fernseh und Rundfunk GmbH (12%)
*In 1979 '''AEG-Telefunken Aktiengesellschaft''' is renamed '''Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft''' ('''AEG'')- as first used in 1887
*1980 [[Heinz Dürr]] becomes board Chairman (until 1990) 
*1982  On the 9th of August a restructuring plan, with federal guarantees of 600 million DM and new bank loans of 275 million DM provided, falls apart at the first disagreement between the banks, a banking consortium gives an administrative loan with the AEG Group until June 1983 of DM 1.1 billion of which 700 million is immediately available with the further DM 400 million available after promise of a guarantee by the federal government. Not only is '''AEG-Telefunken AG''' affected, but also its subsidiaries ''Küppersbusch AG'' in [[Gelsenkirchen]], ''Hermann Zanker Maschinenfabrik GmbH & Co. KG'' in [[Tübingen]] and ''Carl Neff GmbH'' in [[Bretten]]. The ''Alno-Möbelwerke GmbH & Co. KG'' in [[Pfullendorf]] was taken over by previous minority shareholders, and separated from the group. Additionally suppliers of AEG were affected and had to file for bankruptcy - including ''Becher & Co. Möbelfabriken KG'' in [[Bühlertann]] with lack of continuity of company policy a factor. The site at Brunnenstraße in the former Berlin district of Wedding was also sold, as were the firms ''AEG-Fabrik Essen'' and ''Bauknecht''. 
*1983/84 the Consumer electronics division (Telefunken television and broadcasting GmbH) is sold to the French group [[Thomson SA|Thomson-Brandt]].
*1985 '''AEG'' is taken over by [[Daimler-Benz AG]]. Daimler-Benz executive [[Edzard Reuter]] (from 1987 Daimler CEO), decided that two companies should form an "integrated technology group" with beneficial synergy.
*1988 On its 60th year anniversary the ''AEG-Forschungsinstituts'' (AEG Research Institute) creates the Carl-Ramsauer Prize for scientific/technical dissertations. 
*1990 AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems GmbH is formed in association with [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Transportation Systems Inc.]] 
*1992 Merger (or re-uniting) of the railway business with the ''[[Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke]]'' (LEW) in [[Hennigsdorf]], resulting in the formation of ''AEG Schienenfahrzeuge GmbH'' (AEG locomotives)
*1992 The Swedish company [[Atlas Copco]] acquires AEG Power Tools Ltd. 
*1994 sale of the Automation division to [[Schneider Electric]] and of ''AEG Hausgeräte AG'' to [[Electrolux]]. 
*1995 ''AEG Schienenfahrzeuge GmbH'' becomes part of [[Adtranz|ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation (Adtranz)]] (subsequently becoming part of [[Bombardier Transportation]] in 2001). 
*1996 The Annual General Meeting of Daimler-Benz AG chaired by [[Juergen Schrempp]] decides upon the dissolution of the lossmaking group. 
*1996 GEC ALSTHOM acquires AEG Power T&D business
*September 1996 The company is deleted from the commercial register.

==Products==
===Locomotives and railway technology===
[[File:Image-E 60 010.jpg|thumb|AEG electric locomotive.]]
AEG played an important role in the history of the German railways - the company was involved on the development and manufacture of the electrical parts of almost all German electric locomotive series and contributed to the introduction of electrical power in Germany railways.

Additionally many steam locomotives were made in AEG factories. In 1931 the company transferred the locomotive production to the AEG-Borsig works (''Borsig Lokomotiv-Werke GmbH'') from the plant in Hennigsdorf. In 1948 the plant became [[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] ''Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke''. In addition to numerous electric locomotives produced for the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany)|DR]] steam locomotive production continued until 1954.

When the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] began implementing AC propulsion systems AEG found itself in competition with [[Brown, Boveri & Cie|BBC]].  The prototype [[DB Class E320]] was built with [[Krupp]] as dual voltage (15 kV and 25 kV AC) test machine, the technology ultimately leading to locomotives such as [[DB Class 120]] and [[ICE 1]].

Only after [[German reunification]] and the adoption of the LEW plant in Hennigsdorf did AEG's name return to whole locomotive manufacturing, but only for a short time. "AEG locomotives GmbH " became part of [[Adtranz|ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation]] (later ADtranz) and currently the technology developed in the past, in part, now enables [[Bombardier Transportation]] to build the very successful [[TRAXX]] series of locomotives.

===Aircraft===
[[File:AEG GIV bomber.jpg|thumb|[[AEG G.IV]] bomber ([[World War I]]).]]
:''see also'' [[List_of_aircraft_(0-A)#AEG|List of AEG aircraft types]]''
Additionally, AEG manufactured a range of aircraft from 1910 to 1918. 

The first aircraft in 1912 was of wooden construction and modeled after the [[biplane]] of the [[Wright brothers]]. It had a [[wingspan]] of 17.5 m, powered by an eight-cylinder engine producing 75&nbsp;hp; unladen weight was 850&nbsp;kg and could attain a speed of 65&nbsp;km / h. From 1912, the construction of airplanes in mixed wood and steel tube construction with fabric covering. 

One of the planes designed and built was the R-plane (the R was an abbreviation of "Riesenflugzeug" (giant aircraft)) [[AEG R.I]]. This aircraft was powered by four 260 h.p. [[Mercedes D.IV]]a [[Piston engine|engines]] linked to a combination leather cone and [[dog clutch]]. The first flight tests were satisfactory, but on September 3, 1918 the R.I broke up in the air killing its seven crewmen.

During the Second World War AEG produced machines for reconnaissance purposes, including a helicopter platform driven by an AC motor, the power supply was carried by three cables from the ground, this was a tethered craft - the machine could not fly freely. The machine reached an altitude of 300 m.

===Cars===
{{Expand-section|date=March 2009}}
AEG bought [[Kühlstein]] in 1902, founding the division ''[[Neue Automobil Gesellschaft]]'' (New Automobile Company), to make [[automobile|cars]]. AEG withdrew from car production in 1908.<ref>David Burgess Wise, "NAG", in Tom Northey, ed., ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis Publishing Ltd., 1974), Volume 13, pp.1479-80.</ref>
