The '''Ehrhardt''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[automobile]] manufactured from 1905 until 1924.  The company was founded by Gustav Ehrhard, son of Heinrich Ehrhardt of [[Dixi]].  Its operations were centered at [[Zella-St-Blasii]] and at [[DÃ¼sseldorf]].  Ehrhardts came in two- and four-cylinder models of high quality and price.  The largest was a 7956cc four-cylinder which had four-wheel [[brake]]s by 1913.  After 1918, the factory produced a 40hp four-cylinder and a 55hp six-cylinder, both luxury cars with ohc [[engine]]s.

Ehrhardt was succeeded in 1924 by [[Ehrhardt-Szawe]].
