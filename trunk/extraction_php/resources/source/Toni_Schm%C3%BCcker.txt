'''Toni Schmücker''' (23 April 1921 in [[Frechen]] – 6 November 1996 in [[Bergisch Gladbach]]) was the fourth [[chief executive officer]] of the [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen AG)]] automobile company, following the handover of the company in 1948 to German control from the British, who had administered the VW factory in [[Wolfsburg]], [[Germany]] after the Second World War ended.

Schmücker's automotive experience came from a long successful career with [[Ford]] at [[Cologne]] where he began his career as a commercial apprentice when aged 16.<ref name=Autocar197809>{{cite journal|journal =[[Autocar]] |volume = vol 149 (nbr 4271)| authorlink = Edouard Seidler |title =Toni Schmücker: An exclusive interview by Edouard Seidler| pages = Pages 58 - 60| date = 16 [[September]] [[1978]]}}</ref>  He returned to Ford in 1946, following his military service, working successively in the sales, finance and export departments.<ref name=Autocar197809/>   He was appointed Purchasing Manager in 1956 and joined the management board in 1961.  He was appointed Sales manager in 1967 before leaving to become Chairman of [[:de:Rheinstahl|Rheinstahl]] in 1968.<ref name=Autocar197809/>

He became Chairman of the [[Volkswagen]] board in February 1975,<ref name=Autocar197809/> succeeding [[Rudolf Leiding]].  Schmücker brought to the job a combination of political skill and personal charm that had eluded his two immediate predecessors:<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197708>{{cite journal| authorlink = Hans-Robert Richarz| title = Die Macher: VW-Manager von Porsche bis Leiding| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 8 1977| pages = Seite 62 - 64 |date = date 13 April 1977}}</ref> his authority within the company was also enhanced by the extent of the financial crisis that directly preceded his appointment and which had appeared to place the very survival of the business in doubt.  At the time of Schmücker's assumption of the job, Volkswagen had just staved off bankruptcy with the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] (marketed as the Rabbit in North America and as the Caribe in Latin America), which would eventually replace the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].  One of Schmücker's first achievements at Wolfsburg involved reducing the Volkswagen workforce by 25,000 employees during 1975, applying, in the words of a contemporary industry commentator, methods and systems he had learned at Ford.<ref name=Autocar197809/>   The loss making assembly plant in [[Australia]] was closed, but after a period of rationalisation he placed the plants in [[Mexico]] and [[Brazil]] on a sounder footing for growth than that on which he had found them.<ref name=Autocar197809/>

Schmücker's cost-cutting instincts were also evident in the decision to sell back to [[Porsche]] the commission for a successor to the commercially disappointing [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914]].   The new car, based on the underpinnings of the [[Audi 100|Audi 100 C2]], turned up a couple of years later badged as the [[Porsche 924]], but sold in much lower volumes (and at a near Porsche-level higher price) than had been envisaged when Volkswagen had commissioned the project.

In September 1976, Schmücker made history by securing a deal to build a Rabbit factory in [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]], making VW the first non-American car company to build its products in the United States.  It was an effort to make the Rabbit less expensive to sell in North America at a time when the [[German Mark]] was gaining in value both against the U.S. dollar and against the currencies of other competitor economies such as Italy, Japan and France.  The Pennsylvania factory opened on 10 April 1978.

The Schmücker era saw a conscious retreat from the old commitment to crank up volumes at almost any price: Volkswagen by 1980 was only the world's fifth largest auto-maker in terms of unit sales, overtaken during the 1970s by [[Toyota]] and [[Nissan]] since volumes had peaked in 1971.<ref name=Autocar197809/>    Under Schmücker, the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Beetle]] was no longer the unstoppable force in European and US marketplaces it had been at the start of the decade, and in price sensitive markets the German built [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] was hampered by government determination to retain a strong [[Deutschmark|currency]].  VW lost sales volume to the [[Japan]]ese automakers, generally around the world but particularly in [[North America]].  Nevertheless, in 1975 Volkswagen was again profitable and in 1976 it posted a profit of One Billion Marks, earning Schmücker the epithet in Wolfsburg "Toni, der Trickser".<ref>Jerry Sloninger: ''Die VW-Story''; Stuttgart: Motorbuch Verlag, 1981; ISBN 3-87943-737-8; Seite 256</ref>

After suffering a heart attack in 1981, Schmücker was forced to resign the following year, and was succeeded by Dr. [[Carl Hahn]].
