The '''Audi R8''' is a [[sports car]] with a [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally mounted]] [[mid-engine design|mid-engine]], and uses Audi's 'trademark' [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.<ref name="CarAndDriver" />  It was introduced by the [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry|automaker]] [[Audi|Audi AG]] in 2006.  The car was exclusively [[automotive design|designed]], [[research and development|developed]], and [[automotive engineering|manufactured]] by Audi AG's high performance private subsidiary company, [[quattro GmbH]], and is derived from the [[Lamborghini Gallardo]].<ref>CarAndDriver.com [http://www.caranddriver.com/buying_guide/audi/r8/2008_audi_r8/2008_audi_r8_first_drive_review__1+type-reviews_by_make+mode-collection+id-257.html 2008 Audi R8 - First Drive Review]</ref>  The fundamental construction of the R8 is based on the "Audi Space Frame", and uses an [[aluminium]] [[monocoque]] which is built around a [[space frame]].  The car is built by quattro GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's 'aluminium site' at [[Neckarsulm]] in [[Germany]].

In 2005, Audi announced that the ''name'' of the successful [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8 race car]] would be used for a new road car in 2007, the ''Audi R8'', based on the [[Audi Le Mans quattro]] [[concept vehicle|concept car]], appearing at the 2003 [[Geneva Motor Show|International Geneva Motor Show]], and 2003 Frankfurt [[Frankfurt Motor Show|International Motor Show]].  The R8 road car was officially launched at the [[2006 Paris Motor Show|Paris Auto Show]] on 30 September 2006.  There was some confusion with the name, which the car shares with the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winning [[Audi R8 (race car)|R8]] [[Le Mans Prototype]] (LMP), and also the 1989 Mk2 [[Rover 200]], codenamed R8.

The Audi R8 is used as a [[safety car]] in [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] and [[British Superbike Championship]] racing series.
__TOC__

==Production==

To produce the R8 at [[quattro GmbH]], seventy workers fit 5,000 unique parts by hand.  The factory at [[Neckarsulm]], redeveloped at a cost of [[Euro sign|€]]28 million, produces between eight and fifteen cars a day.  Ninety-five [[laser]]s inspect the entire car in five seconds to ensure that over 220 measurements are within 0.1&nbsp;[[milimetre|millimetres]] of the programmed plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://microsites.audi.co.uk/r8launch/?#|title=Audi UK R8 microsite}}</ref>

==Available markets==
The 2-seat [[coupé]] is currently available in [[Europe]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[Japan]].  Rumours hold that an R8 Spider, an open-top [[roadster]] model, will follow sometime in 2009.  The R8 is 2 pound rand
In [[Latin America]], the R8 became available at the end of 2008 at dealers in Mexico City, Bogota, Medellin, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Lima and Santiago.  Customers bought every unit available for 2008 within a week<ref name="carautoportal">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-r8.php|title=Audi R8 Reference|accessdate=2009-06-26|work=carautoportal.com}}</ref> after the R8 premiered at the [[Bogota International Auto Show]] and [[Auto Expo of Medellin]].

In [[Asia]], the R8 is available in [[India]], Japan, [[Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], [[Philippines]] and [[Hong Kong]], and has been available in [[China]], [[Turkey]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Singapore]] and [[Indonesia]] since 2008.

==Powertrain==
[[Image:2007 Audi R8 Engine.JPG|thumb|right|The [[V8 engine]] in the R8]]
The Audi R8 was initially equipped with a 4.2&nbsp;[[litre]] [[V8 engine|V8]] [[internal combustion engine]].  Specific detail: it is an all-[[aluminium alloy]] [[multi-valve|32-valve]] (four valves per cylinder) [[petrol engine]], utilising [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), and has a [[engine displacement|displacement]] of {{convert|4163|cc|1|abbr=on|lk=on}}.  It develops a [[motive power]] output of {{convert|309|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}, and generates {{convert|430|Nm|0|lk=on}} of [[torque]], on 98&nbsp;[[octane rating#RON|RON]] 'Super Unleaded' petrol.  It is basically the same engine used in the [[Audi RS4#B7|B7 Audi RS4]], but is modified to use [[dry sump]] lubrication system.  This V8 is a highly reworked, high-revving variant from the existing 4.2&nbsp;litre V8, but includes cylinder-direct [[fuel injection]] (Fuel Stratified Injection), and [[multi-valve|four valves per cylinder]], instead of five (as used on the non-FSI variants).  It also uses two chain-driven [[overhead camshaft#dual overhead camshaft|dual overhead camshafts]] (DOHC) per [[cylinder bank]], and utilises [[variable valve timing]] for both inlet and exhaust [[camshaft]]s.

A new additional variant with a 5.2&nbsp;litre Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) [[V10 engine]] was added on the 9th of December 2008, which produces {{convert|386|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|530|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="PaulTan.org"/>

The [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] options are either a [[Lamborghini]] sourced [[manual transmission|manual gearbox]] with metal gate for the shift lever, or an Audi-developed "R tronic" gearbox - which is a single-[[clutch]] [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]] [[electrohydraulic manual transmission]], without a traditional clutch pedal.  These options are the same as those available on the [[Lamborghini Gallardo]].  A double-clutch [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG), now badged by Audi as "S tronic", is not available (as of December 2008).

===V10 engine===
[[Image:AudiR8v10.jpg|right|thumb|Audi R8 with a [[V10 engine]] at the 2009 [[North American International Auto Show]]]]
Audi AG unveiled the Audi R8 V10 on 9 December 2008.  It uses a 5.2&nbsp;[[litre]] FSI [[internal combustion engine]], based on the unit in the [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] LP560-4, but is detuned to produce a [[motive power]] output of {{convert|386|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}, and generate {{convert|530|Nm|0|lk=on}} of [[torque]].<ref name="PaulTan.org"/>  Compared to the V8 variant, the R8 V10's performance numbers are enhanced.  Audi estimates the new 0-{{convert|100|km/h|0|lk=on}} time as only 3.9&nbsp;[[second]]s, 60-124&nbsp;mph in 8.1&nbsp;seconds, and a top speed of {{convert|196|mph|1|abbr=on}}. Other changes to the V10 version of the R8 include some aesthetic differences such as all-[[headlight#LED light sources|LED headlights]], interior enhancements, and a more aggressive body styling,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2008/12/08/audi-r8-v10/|title=Audi Unveils the V10 R8 with 525 HP|publisher=Automoblog.net}}</ref> larger rear brakes and unique [[wheel|roadwheels]].

It was initially thought that this version of the R8 was going to have the same engine as the [[Audi RS6#C6|C6 Audi RS6]], a 5.0&nbsp;litre V10 TFSI [[twin-turbo|'biturbo']] engine, which produces {{convert|580|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}.  However, some components of the [[twin-turbo]] system overheated, and one prototype was destroyed by fire at the [[Nürburgring]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/11/27/mysteriously-burnt-audi-revealed-to-be-v10-rs8/|title=Mysteriously burnt Audi revealed to be V10 RS8|publisher=Autoblog.com}}</ref>  This model is showing at the 2009 [[North American International Auto Show]].  This version of the R8 appears in the trailers and in the box art of the [[Xbox 360]] racing game, [[Forza Motorsport 3]].<ref>http://forzamotorsport.net/en-uk/game/default.htm</ref>

==Other technical details==

[[Image:Black Audi R8 - 20090803.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Black Audi R8]]

As [[Audi|Audi AG]] owns [[Lamborghini]] (Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.), some of the R8 is shared with the [[Lamborghini Gallardo]], including some of the [[chassis]] and [[floorpan]], transmissions, and the revised V10 engine.  The R8 is made distinct by its Germanic exterior styling, cabin, smaller V8 engine, magnetic dampers, and pricing.

The R8 (with the [[V8 engine]]) has a dry weight of {{convert|1560|kg|0|lk=on}}.  Its [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] uses Delphi<ref>http://investor.delphi.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=105758&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=937293&highlight=</ref> [[magneto rheological damper]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/Applications/PrimarySuspension/tabid/3329/Default.aspx|title= Primary Suspension|publisher=Lord.com}}</ref>

Safety features include [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;8.0 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] with [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] ABS, front dual-stage [[airbag]]s, and 'sideguard' curtain airbags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/audi/r8/2008/|title=2008 Audi R8 Review|accessdate=2008-08-12|publisher=JB car pages}}</ref> The R8 also features state-of-the-art LED safety light bars mounted just under the headlamps.

The R8, like most [[mid-engine design|mid]]- or [[rear-engine design]]ed sports cars, utilises wider [[wheel|roadwheels]] and [[tire|tyres]] on its rear [[axle]].  For the 18&nbsp;[[inch]] [[alloy wheel]]s (on standard summer tyres), there is just one range of sizes - the fronts are sized at 8.5Jx18H2&nbsp;ET42, whilst the rears are two inches wider at 10.5Jx18H2&nbsp;ET50.  With the 19&nbsp;inch wheels, the theme continues - the fronts are all 8.5Jx19H2&nbsp;ET42, and the rears are 11.0Jx19H2&nbsp;ET50.  19" wheels for the winter tyre package have a ½" narrower rear compared to the summer tyre wheel package.  There is also a corresponding difference in tyre sizes - 18's are 235/40&nbsp;ZR18&nbsp;95Y&nbsp;XL (eXtra Load) up front and 285/35&nbsp;ZR18&nbsp;101Y&nbsp;XL at the rear.  For the 19" tyres, two different options are available - all fronts are 235/35&nbsp;ZR19&nbsp;91Y, and the rears are either 295/30&nbsp;ZR19&nbsp;100Y&nbsp;XL or 305/30&nbsp;ZR19&nbsp;102Y&nbsp;XL.  Standard factory supplied tyre makes offered are either [[Continental AG|Continental]] SportContact3, or [[Pirelli]] P-Zero Rosso.

==Reviews==
Many publications{{Which?|date=March 2009}} were hailing it as the first car to truly be able to beat the [[Porsche 997]] — considered by many{{Who|date=January 2009}} to be one of the best [[sports car]]s ever made, and a leader in its class.<ref>AutomobileMag.com [http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/0902_2010_audi_r8_v10/index.html Review: 2010 Audi R8 V10]</ref>  Initial comparison tests have proven quite positive in this respect; [[Evo Magazine]] listed it as a "[[supercar]]",<ref name="Evo">{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/videos/planetevovideos/209977/audi_r8.html|title=Audi R8 - "We can’t think of another ''supercar'' that takes a demanding road with such surgical precision"|publisher=EVO Magazine}}</ref> compared the R8 to the [[Porsche 997|Porsche 911 Carrera 4S]], [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage]], and [[BMW M6]] and after praising the R8's "amazing stability, traction and grip, unparalleled steering accuracy and bite, (and) its uncannily flat and disturbance-free ride", claimed that as a result of "the sublime effortlessness of it all", the Audi is a better sports car.  The article concluded that "Audi humbles Porsche.  A new dawn starts today".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/cargrouptests/209930/supercars.html|title=Audi R8 v rivals - "it will rupture the supercar status quo"|publisher=EVO Magazine}}</ref>

In a half mile drag race conducted by Top Gear between the R8 and a 997 Carrera S, the Porsche won, crossing the line just a half meter before the R8. However, the R8 easily beat the Porsche around Top Gear's test track.

The television show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' compared the [[Nissan GT-R]] to the R8, and remarked that the R8 was "simultaneously less impressive and yet somehow more involving".  On the R8 they wrote that "it rewards driver input", calling it "fantastic in a way that will appeal more to true car enthusiasts", but also remarked that it was "much slower", and the GT-R was cheaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2008/02/stories/07/4.html|title=Audi R8 vs Nissan GT-R feature|publisher=TopGear.com}}</ref>  On their test track, the car performed better than a [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] and an [[Aston Martin DB9]].

On [[Bedford Autodrome]], tested by [[Evo Magazine]], the R8 was faster than the [[Lamborghini Gallardo]].{{citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Future development==
===R8 TDI diesel===
The '''Audi R8 V12 TDI''' (later renamed the '''Audi R8 TDI Le Mans'''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audi.co.uk/audi/uk/en2/experience/Studies/Audi_R8_TDI_Le_Mans.html|title=Audi R8 TDI Le Mans|publisher= Audi.co.uk}}</ref> was unveiled as a [[diesel engine]]d [[concept vehicle|concept car]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/214614/audi_r8.html|title=Diesel power for Audi R8 supercar|publisher=AutoExpress.co.uk}}</ref> was presented at the 2008 [[North American International Auto Show]] on 13 January,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=124210|title=2008 Detroit Auto Show Preview: Audi R8 TDI Concept|publisher=Edmunds.com - Inside Line}}</ref> and the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in March.  It was to use a 6.0&nbsp;litre [[V12 engine]], utilising [[Volkswagen Group]]'s long-established [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[turbodiesel]] technology.  This [[internal combustion engine|engine]] was rated {{convert|500|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|1000|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.  It uses Audi's [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system, and is [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally]] [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]].  It has a six-speed [[manual transmission]].  It accelerates from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|0|lk=on}} in 4.2&nbsp;seconds, and its top speed is {{convert|325|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The R8 TDI Le Mans has modified [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] settings and [[brake]]s, to cope with the additional power and weight ({{convert|300|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}), resulting from replacing the standard V8 engine with the V12 TDI.  The V12 TDI requires more cooling than the standard R8, hence the [[NACA duct]] in the roof to feed additional air in to the engine.  The vents on the front and back of the car have also been increased by 20% in size.  The headlights are [[headlight#LED light sources|all-LED]].  For its appearance at the Detroit Motor Show, Audi fitted 20-inch alloy wheels.  The rear [[bulkhead]] has been moved forward in order to accommodate the physically larger V12 engine, meaning it loses the space behind the rear seats usually found on the standard R8.

In May 2009, Audi decided to halt plans to produce the R8 TDI, citing "the cost of re-engineering the petrol R8 to accommodate the massive [[twin-turbo]]charged diesel engine is simply too great – and that it would be unable to recoup its investment through sales alone". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audisite.com/532/audi-cans-the-r8-v12-tdi/|title=Audi Cans the R8 V12 TDI|publisher=AudiSite.com}}</ref>

===Audi R8 Spyder===
Although it was rumored by the automotive press since the announcement of the production R8 in 2006, it was only in August 2008 that spy shots of a convertible R8 'Spider' were published online, which included a "soft-top" roof is clearly visible, and the unique sideblade has been removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/convertibles/preview-2009-audi-r8-spider/ |title=Preview: Audi R8 ‘Spider’ convertible - MotorAuthority - Car news, reviews, spy shots |publisher=MotorAuthority.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>  

The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/09/audi-r8-spyder-gets-an-early-unveiling-ahead-of-frankfurt/ Audi R8 Spyder gets an early unveiling]</ref> 

Compared with the coupe model, the convertible will have extra chassis support, a pair of roll-over safety bars, as well as minor changes such as the location of the fuel tank filler.  It is expected as V10 powered model.

===[[Audi e-Tron]]===
The Audi e-tron concept was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. It is an electric supercar based on the Audi R8, and has a fully-electric powertrain with an electric motor on each wheel which distributes torque individually, allowing for a full [[Quattro_(four_wheel_drive_system)|quattro]] layout. The electric motors in the e-tron concept produces 230 kW (313 hp) and 4,500 Nm (3,319.03 lb-ft) of torque, for exceptional acceleration. Production date and price are unavailable, as the e-Tron is currently a [[concept car]] only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audisite.com/1008/audi-e-tron-electric-concept-unveiled/|title=Audi e-Tron Electric Concept Unveiled|publisher=Audisite.com}}</ref>

==Hand Writing Recognition Technology==
There are reports that the next generation R8 will feature a satellite navigation system with hand writing recognition technology, so they can do away with the use of a keypad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carthusiast.com/audi-r8-may-feature-hand-writing-recognition-technology-2086.html |title=Audi R8 may feature Hand Writing Recognition technology |publisher=Carthusiast |date= |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref>

===Audi R8 LMS===
[[Image:Audi R8 LMS in Spa 2009.JPG|right|thumb|Audi R8 LMS competing in the 2009 [[Belgian GT Championship]] season]] For 2009, Audi announced the production of an R8 LMS racing car, designed for the GT3 rules in the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] and various national racing series.  Known within [[Audi Sport]] as the 'R16', the R8 LMS features a {{convert|500|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} [[V10 engine]].  Because the GT3 regulations prohibit the use of [[four-wheel drive]], Audi had to drop its 'trademark' [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] four-wheel drive system, and the R8 LMS comes with the typical [[rear-wheel drive]] setup.  The [[torque]] is transmitted via a newly developed six-speed sequential sports gearbox.

Despite the development of the car, Audi itself had stated not to enter any races with the new GT3 car as an official 'factory' team.<ref name="R8 LMS">{{cite web | url = http://www.planetlemans.com/2008/11/28/audi-announces-its-2009-motorsport-programme/ | title = Audi announces its 2009 motorsport programme | publisher = PlanetLeMans.com | date = 2008-11-28 | accessdate = 2008-11-28}}</ref>
