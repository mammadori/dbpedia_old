The '''Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class''' (internal name CL203) is a [[luxury vehicle|luxury]] [[compact car]] which has been produced by the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes Car Group]] division of [[Daimler AG]] since 2002, as part of the [[Mercedes-Benz W203#W203 (2000–2007)|C-Class]], and since 2008 as its own lineup. The car is a three-door [[liftback]].<ref>[http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-614233-1-1034478-1-0-0-0-0-1-11817-854934-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html?TS=1199899280531&REF=921%2Fen%2FMercedes-Benz%20Cars%2FMercedes-Benz%20P.%20Cars%2F.Newsroom%20%28Mercedes-Benz%20P.Cars%29%2F%23XCID%3D617718%20%7C%20XPID%3D0%20%7C%20XCTY%3D3897%20%7C%20XAID%3D New Key Visual for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Berlin 2008: Two stars in the photo studio: Top model Eva Padberg and the new Mercedes-Benz CLC] Daimler Global Media Site - January 9, 2008</ref>

==First generation==
The first generation was based on the [[Mercedes-Benz W203#W203 (2000–2007)|W203 C-Class]] and sold as the '''C-Class Sportcoupé''' or '''Sport Coupe'''. At the launch of the Sportcoupé, a new family of supercharged four cylinder engines, dubbed [[Mercedes-Benz M271 engine|M271]], also debuted for the entire range C-Class range. All of them used the same 1.8 L engine, with different designations according to horsepower levels, including a version powered by [[natural gas]]. The 193 PS (142&nbsp;kW/190 hp) C 230K was initially available only in the Sportcoupé.<ref name="canadiandriver.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/testdrives/02c230sc.htm |title=Mercedes-Benz » Test Drive: 2002 Mercedes-Benz C230 Kompressor Sport Coupe |publisher=CanadianDriver |date=2002-01-10 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

While [[BMW]]'s [[BMW Compact|3-Series hatchback]] was criticized as looking like a full-sized 3-series with the rear chopped off,<ref name="canadiandriver.com"/>  the Sportcoupé's [[fastback]] profile was considered a more stylist off-shoot of the C-Class sedan. While the C230 base model enabled the automaker to reach a lower price point than existing models sold in North America, some suggested that the hatchback configuration (as "liftback" is almost never used in North America) and the "inexpensive Mercedes" moniker would undermine the marque which was traditionally composed of expensive cars. It also lacked standard leather seats and a CD player, amenities typically expected of German luxury imports (especially a Mercedes).<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Frank |url=http://www.forbes.com/2001/11/19/1119test.html |title=Mercedes Benz C230 Sports Coupe |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

Like the BMW 3-Series hatchback, the Sportcoupé proved unpopular with the younger buyers it was targeted towards, due to high prices compared to the lower entry-level models it was competing against, as well as unfavorable exchange rates. Although removed from the [[North America]]n lineup in 2005, it continued on sale in other markets. From October 2000 until 2007, a total of 230,000 Sportcoupés were built in the [[Bremen]] factory and in Brazil.<ref>''auto motor und spo''rt, #3/2008, p. 27</ref>

==Second generation==
The Sportcoupé was eventually spun off into its own separate line called the CLC-Class, but it still based on the W203 platform, with an updated front and tail inspired by the  [[Mercedes-Benz W203#W204 (2007–present)|W204 C-Class]]. Mercedes found that the Sportcoupé was a popular first Mercedes for new customers, 40 per cent of whom reportedly return to buy more expensive models later on,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilesreview.com/reviews/mercedes-benz-clc-class/905/ |title=Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class — Automobiles Review |publisher=Automobilesreview.com |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Gerry |last= Malloy |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Production version set for Toyota mini-car concept |url=http://www.wheels.ca/article/191765 |work= |publisher=Toronto Star |date=2008-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId=47781 |title=Full Test: 2002 Mercedes-Benz C230 Sports Coupe |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2001-11-06 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> therefore it was decided that there was not much scope seen in developing a completely brand new model, since it is a 'budget C-Class', which offers buyers a very reasonabaly priced entry into Mercedes ownership.  It therefore had do with a completely re-designed rear and front along with some other refined or new details (Mercedes claims this to be around 1000 features) to keep it fresh, also in this way the status of the [[W204 C-class]] would be further protected.

The CLC is produced in Brazil at the company’s plant in [[Juiz de Fora]], close to the state border with [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>[http://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br/segredo-mercedes-benz-classe-c-sport-coupe-no-brasil/ Segredo : Mercedes-Benz Class C Sport Coupe no Brasil] http://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br</ref>

The car was presented at the 2008 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Berlin, which took place from the 27th to 31st of January 2008.<ref>[http://paultan.org/archives/2008/01/09/mercedes-benz-releases-clc-class-coupe-teaser/ Mercedes-Benz releases CLC-Class coupe teaser]</ref>

In 2009 the CLC 160 BlueEFFICIENCY was added to the range, and the CLC 230 is rechristened CLC 250.

==Range==
The CLC range is the following, at launch the only new model was the CLC 200 KOMPRESSOR, with its engine coming from the [[W204 C-class]]:<ref>[http://www.mercedes-benz.de/content/media_library/hq/hq_mpc_reference_site/passenger_cars/passenger_cars_world/whats_new/PCWorld_WhatsNew_CLC-Class_649_de_12_2007_pdf.object-Single-MEDIA.download.tmp/CLC-Class_CL203_0108_01.pdf CLC Flyer] Official German Mercedes web site - January 2008</ref>
