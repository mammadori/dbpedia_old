'''Horch''' was a car brand manufactured in [[Germany]] by '''August Horch & Cie''', at the beginning of the 20th century.

The company was established first by [[August Horch]] and a partner on [[November 14]], [[1899]] with a capital of 30,000 [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] at Ehrenfeld, near Cologne.  August Horch was a former production manager for [[Karl Benz]]. Three years later in 1902 he moved with his company to [[Reichenbach/Vogtland]]. On May, 10th, 1904 he founded the '''Horch & Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG''', a joint-stock company in [[Zwickau]]/[[Saxony]], an action that he was to later regret. [[Zwickau]] was the capital of the South Western Saxon County and one of Saxony's industrial centres at the time.  

On July 16, 1909, August Horch, after troubles with Horch chief financial officer, founded his second company, the '''August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH''' in Zwickau. He had to rename his new company because ''Horch'' was already a registred brand and he did not hold the rights on it. On April 25, 1910 the brand '''[[Audi]]''' was entered in the company's register of Zwickau registration court. ''Audi'' is the Latin translation of ''horch'' (pronounced: "hark" or "horsh"), the imperative form of the German verb ''hoeren'' ("to hear"). Audi brand was invented by a son of one of his business partners from Zwickau.

Both companies from Zwickau (Horch and Audi) were unified in 1932 with [[Dampf-Kraft-Wagen|DKW]] and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] to Saxony's [[Auto Union]] corporation. The [[Silver Arrow]] racing cars of the Auto Union racing team in Zwickau, developed by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Robert Eberan von Eberhorst]], driven by [[Bernd Rosemeyer]], [[Hans Stuck]], [[Tazio Nuvolari]], [[Ernst von Delius]], were known the world over in the nineteen-thirties.

==Initial cars==
The company initially began producing 5 and 10 [[Horsepower|hp]] twin-cylinder engine automobiles near [[Cologne]] in 1901.  

The first Horch had a 4.5 hp engine, with an alloy crankcase, a unique achievement in those days.  It had an open-body design, with lighting provided by lanterns with candles in them.  In contrast with the powerful cars of later years, the first Horch could barely reach a top speed of {{convert|32|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. It was significant at that time because it used a friction clutch, and also had a drive shaft to power the wheels.

The firm soon ran into financial troubles, not surprising considering the pioneering nature of the automobile business at that time.  Horch had to seek new partners.

On March, 1902, August Horch produced a 20 hp four-cylinder car with a shaft drive in [[Reichenbach im Vogtland]]. Horch cars were considered more advanced and superior to those being then built by [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] or [[Benz]] (who were then separate manufacturers). 

By 1903, Horch had built a car with a four-cylinder engine. In March of the following year, he introduced his new car at the [[Frankfurt]] Fair.

In 1904, August Horch developed the first six-cylinder engine, which appeared in 1907. In 1906 a Horch automobile driven by Dr. Rudolf Stöss from Zwickau won the Herkomer Competition (equivalent to a 'brand-name' world championship at the time). In the twenties, Moritz Stauss, a cosmopolitan Berliner, was the principal stockholder of the Horch company. He succeded in making the Horch brand highly desirable by introducing art into the advertising of their products. He recognized that only a brand emphasising Horch's unique characteristics would be successful.
In 1923 Paul Daimler (a Stauss associate) worked for Horch as the chief engineer for 8 cylinder engines. Horch vehicles were subsequently the first to introduce 8 cylinder engines in series production.

==Audi connection==

In 1909, the supervisory board (the German equivalent of the Board of Directors) of the corporation forced out Horch.  Horch went on to found [[Audi]] as Audiwerke GmbH, which became effective on [[25 April]] [[1910]].   The name was a solution to the legal dispute with his old company over use of the Horch brand.

In 1928, the company was acquired by [[J S Rasmussen|Jörgen Skafte Rasmussen]], owner of [[DKW]] (from the German ''Dampfkraftwagen'', or, steam engine vehicle), who had bought the remains of the US automobile manufacturer [[Rickenbacker (car)|Rickenbacker]] in the same year. The Rickenbacker purchase included their manufacturing equipment for eight-cylinder engines.

==Auto Union==
Eventually, on [[29 June]] [[1932]], Horch, Audi, [[DKW]] and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] merged to form the [[Auto Union]] affiliated group.  The current Audi four-ring logo is the Auto Union logo that represents for the merger of these four brands. In the 1930s Horch introduced a new line of smaller and cheaper, but still presentable, V8 automobiles. In 1936 ''Horch'' presented the 25,000th 8 cylinder luxury car in [[Zwickau]].

Auto Union became a major supplier of automobiles to the [[German armed forces]].  Civilian production was suspended after March 1940.  After the war, Auto Union, newly founded in West Germany, continued civilian car production.  Due to widespread poverty in post-war Germany, only small DKW vehicles were produced.  Luxury vehicle production did not resume until Auto Union was purchased in 1964 by [[Volkswagen Group]] and the old brand ''Audi'' was introduced again.

==Trabant connection==
During the [[Second World War]], the factories suffered heavy bomb damage.  Later, the advancing [[Soviet]] forces captured the area, and it became part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Soviet sector of divided Germany]] in 1945, and later became part of [[East Germany]].  

From 1955 to 1958 old ''Horch'' factories produced the Horch P240, a 6 cylinder car with standing at the time. The former ''Horch'' and ''Audi'' from Zwickau were unified in 1958. A new brand, ''Sachsenring'', within the East German corporation [[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau|IFA]] was born. After unification in 1958 the P240 car was renamed as the [[Sachsenring P240]]. As the Soviet Administration inexplicably banned the foreign exportation of the P240 the East German economic administration decided to stop production of the vehicle. IFA also produced the initial [[Trabant]] "P-50" model from 1957.<ref>[http://trabant.shocauto.com/trabant_history.htm Trabant History]</ref>

==Rare collectibles==
On Saturday, June 24, 2006, an incredibly rare 1937 Horch 853A Sport Cabriolet in original unrestored, unprepared condition sold at auction in Cortland NY for $299,000 US.<ref>[http://www.rmauctions.com/AuctionResults.cfm?SaleCode=JS06&SortBy=HB&View=Normal&Category=Cars Rm Auctions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In the late 1930s, Horch supplied a limited number of promotional scarves bearing the Horch logo.  Only sent to the most wealthy drivers, it is a major collectible amongst diehard enthusiasts of the pre-war car era.  However there is also a degree of controversy associated with these scarves as they were commonly sought after by senior SS members.
