{{TOC right}}'''List of Volkswagen Group petrol engines'''.  The [[spark-ignition engine|spark-ignition]] [[petrol engine]]s listed below are currently being installed by various [[marque]]s of [[automobile]]s and [[commercial vehicle]]s, along with [[Volkswagen Industrial Motor]] applications, of the [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry]] conglomerate and holding company - [[Volkswagen Group]] (VWAG).  All [[list of Volkswagen engines|listed engines]] operate on the [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke cycle]], and unless stated otherwise, use a [[wet sump]] [[motor oil|lubrication]] system, and are [[water cooling|water cooled]].

Since the Volkswagen Group is [[Europe]]an, official [[internal combustion engine]] performance ratings are published using the [[International System of Units]] (commonly abbreviated "SI"), a modern form of the [[metric system]] of figures.  [[Motor vehicle]] engines will have been tested by a [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]] (DIN) accredited testing facility, to either the original ''80/1269/[[European Economic Community|EEC]]'', or the later ''1999/99/[[EC]]'' standards.  The standard initial measuring unit for establishing the rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output is the [[watt#kilowatt|kilowatt]] (kW); and in their official literature, the power rating may be published in either the kW, or the [[horsepower#PS|'Pferdestärke']] (PS), or both, and may also include conversions to imperial units such as the [[horsepower]] (hp) or [[horsepower#brake horsepower|brake horsepower]] (bhp).  ([[conversion of units#power or heat flow rate|Conversions]]: one&nbsp;PS ≈ 735.5&nbsp;[[watt]]s (W), ≈ 0.98632&nbsp;hp (SAE)).  (The PS figure is sometimes incorrectly referred to as 'metric horsepower').  In case of conflict, the metric power figure of kilowatts (kW) will be stated as the primary figure of reference.  For the turning force generated by the engine, the [[Newton metre]] (Nm) will be the reference figure of [[torque]].  Furthermore, in accordance with European automotive traditions, engines shall be listed in the following ''ascending'' order of preference:
#Number of [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]],
#[[Engine displacement]] (in [[litre]]s),
#[[Engine configuration]], and
#Rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output (in [[watt#kilowatt|kilowatts]]).

The petrol engines which Volkswagen Group previously [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|manufactured]] and installed are in the '''''[[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines]]''''' article.

==EA111==
The '''EA111''' series of [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] [[list of Volkswagen engines|engines]] was introduced in the mid [[1970s]] in the [[Audi 50]], and shortly after in the original [[Volkswagen Polo]].  It is a series of [[water cooling|water cooled]] [[straight-three engine|inline three-]] and [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] petrol and [[diesel engine]]s, in a variety of [[engine displacement|displacement sizes]].  This [[overhead camshaft]] engine features a [[crossflow cylinder head]] design, and directly-driven auxiliary units.{{clarify|date=June 2009}}  The exhaust side is in driving direction, closest to the front of the vehicle.

==Four cylinder EA827/EA113 petrols{{anchors|EA827|EA113}}==
The '''EA827''' family of [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] [[list of Volkswagen engines|engines]] was introduced in [[1972]] in the [[Audi 80]], and was eventually superseded by the '''EA113''' evolution introduced in [[1993]].  Both share the same {{convert|88|mm|2|lk=on}} [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] spacing.  The latter EA113 was updated with [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) direct injection, to be topped by the 265&nbsp;PS 2.0&nbsp;TFSI used in the [[Audi S3#8P|Audi S3 (8P)]].  Forty million engines have been produced.  This range will eventually be superseded by the all new '''[[#EA888|EA888]]''' project, introduced with the [[#1.8 TFSI|1.8 TSI/TFSI]] below, but the '''EA113''' still remains in production.

===1.4 TSI 90-133kW{{anchors|1.4TSI|BLG|BMY|CAXC}}===
Based on the EA111, this new engine was announced at the 2005 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], to be first used in the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5#GT|Mk5 Golf GT]], the 125&nbsp;kW 1.4&nbsp;[[litre]] TSI engine is a "[[Twincharger]]", and uses both a [[turbocharger]] and a [[supercharger]].  Its [[downsizing]] leads to improved fuel economy, with 14% more power than the 2.0&nbsp;FSI, but consuming 5% less fuel.  The mechanical supercharger compressor, driven at 1.5 times the speed of the [[crankshaft]], mainly operates at low engine speeds up to 2,400&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute]] (rpm) to increase low-end [[torque]].  At engine speeds just above idle, the belt-driven supercharger provides a boost pressure of 1.2&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]].  The turbocharger assumes full effectiveness at middle revs, and the engine map disengages the clutch-controlled supercharger at a maximum upper limit of 3,500&nbsp;rpm; the supercharger will then be bypassed once the turbocharger reaches sufficient speed to provide adequate boost in the upper rev-ranges.  This engine is made at Volkswagen-Motorenfertigung, [[Chemnitz]].

In 2007, Volkswagen announced the 90&nbsp;kW model which will replace the [[#1.6 FSI 85kW|1.6 FSI {{convert|85|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}]] engine.  This engine differs from the 103&nbsp;kW and 125&nbsp;kW models in several ways.  It uses only a turbocharger (and not a supercharger), and has water-cooled intercooler.  The engine has reduced frictional losses, optimised [[camshaft]]s, new intake port, and new high-pressure injector valves.  It is also 14&nbsp;kg lighter than the 125&nbsp;kW model, in order to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions.

Was winner of the "1.8-litre 2.0-litre" category for four consecutive years in the 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 annual competition for [[International Engine of the Year]].

==Four cylinder EA888 petrols{{anchor|EA888}}==
This latest '''EA888''' family of [[internal combustion|internal combustion]] [[list of Volkswagen engines|engines]] is anticipated to be an eventual complete replacement of the '''[[#EA113|EA113]]''' range.  It was wholly [[automotive design|designed]] and [[research and development|developed]] by [[Audi|Audi AG]].  The only common feature with its predecessors is the sharing of the same {{convert|88|mm|2|lk=on}} [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] spacing - which keeps the engine length relatively short, meaning it can be installed either [[transverse engine|transversely]] or [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally]].  [[gray iron|Grey]] [[cast iron]] (GJL 250) remains the choice material for the [[cylinder block]] and [[crankcase]], due to its inherent good acoustic dampening properties.  This all-new EA888 range is notable for utilising simplex [[roller chain]]s to drive the two [[overhead camshaft]]s, instead of the former engines' toothed-rubber [[timing belt]].  Like the final developments of the former engine generation, all EA888s only use the Audi-created [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) direct injection.  Furthermore, EA888 engines are also able utilise the Audi-developed 'valvelift' technology, which complements the existing [[variable valve timing]].  This new family of engines is scheduled to be universally available for all markets on five continents, within all [[marque]]s of the [[Volkswagen Group]].  The former EA113 range still remains in production.

==Eight cylinder petrols{{anchor|8}}==
Of their eight cylinder [[petrol engine]]s, all [[Volkswagen Group]] '''''[[V8 engine]]s''''' are primarily constructed from a lightweight, [[casting|cast]] [[aluminium alloy]] [[cylinder block]] ([[crankcase]]) and [[cylinder head]]s.  They all use [[multi-valve]] technology, with the [[poppet valve#internal combustion engine|valves]] being operated by [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|two]] [[overhead camshaft]]s per [[cylinder bank]] (sometimes referred to as 'quad cam').  All functions of engine control are carried out by varying types of [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] [[Motronic]] electronic [[engine control unit]]s.  These V8 petrol engines have only been used in [[automobile|cars]] bearing the [[Audi]] [[marque]]; they are [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally]] [[front-engine design|front-mounted]].

===4.2 V8 FSI 257-309kW{{anchors|079.D|BAR|BNS|BVJ|BYH|CAU}}===
Fundamentally based on the existing [[Audi]] [[V8 engine]], this new engine is heavily revised over its' predecessor, with all-new components including: [[crankshaft]], [[connecting rod]]s and [[piston]]s, [[cylinder head]]s and [[valvetrain]], [[motor oil|oil]] supply and cooling system, intake path and [[exhaust system]], and engine management system.  It is available in two versions; a basic or 'comfort' version, first used in the [[Audi Q7]]; and a sports-focussed high-revving version, with features which hail from [[auto racing|motorsport]], for the [[Audi RS4#B7|B7 RS4 quattro]] and the [[Audi R8]].  This is the first eight [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] road car engine to use [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), which was successfully developed by Audi in their LeMans winning [[Audi R8 (race car)|R8 racing car]].  The [[#5.2 FSI V10 320-331kW|5.2 FSI V10]] will be developed directly from this V8 engine.

===5.2 FSI V10 320-331kW{{anchors|BXA|BSM}}===
A first in [[Audi]]'s history, this new generation high performance [[V10 engine]] is based on [[#4.2 V8 FSI 257-309kW|Audi's FSI V8 engines]], and retains the same fundamental design principals of the FSI [[V8 engine|V8]], including the [[crankcase]], [[cylinder head]]s, [[valvetrain]], fuel system and intake manifold.  However, an all new [[crankshaft]], [[balance shaft]], double-chambered intake manifold with dual throttle valves, exhaust manifold, and ECU - are all unique to the V10.  As part of the new V10 engine development, specific emphasis was placed on 'refinement', 'comfort' and 'sportiness' - as required for installation in Audi [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] [[luxury vehicle|luxury cars]].  As well as gaining two additional cylinders compared to the V8, it has been bored by an extra two [[millimetre]]s, and also shares the 90° angle of the recent Audi [[V engine]]s.  Audi continue to use the [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) technology, originally developed in the Audi R8 LMP endurance race cars.

This engine is often, but incorrectly referred to as a derivative of the Gallardo's original 5.0&nbsp;litre [[Lamborghini V10]], which was also developed under the Volkswagen Group ownership.
