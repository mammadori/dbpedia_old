The '''BMW F01''' is the current 7 series that went into production in September 2008. The long wheelbase model, codenamed '''BMW F02''', is {{convert|14|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer than the BMW F01.

==Presentation==
The car's official unveiling occurred in the Red Square in Moscow (Russia) on 8 July 2008. The unusual nature of the unveiling had been attracting attention since 6 July 2008. The new BMW 7 series was placed in the upper half of an acrylic, glass, and steel [[hourglass]]. The car was  initially hidden by more than 180,000 silvered balls, which gradually dropped into the lower half to reveal the new BMW 7 Series.<ref>{{cite web|author=Back to post |url=http://www.autoblog.com/photos/bmw-7-series-gets-ballsy-unveiling-in-russia/917158/ |title=Autoblog |publisher=Autoblog |date=2008-07-14 |accessdate=2009-04-12}}</ref>

==Vehicle characteristics==
===Design===
For the 7 Series, the previous [[BMW E65|E65/E66]] model marked a revolution in the 7-Series design, while the F01 is more evolutionary. The front end is inspired by the [[BMW CS Concept]], from the large twin grilles to the headlamps, which have "eyebrows" and internal configuration similar to individual lamps but slightly different in shape.<ref name="F01">{{cite web |url=http://paultan.org/archives/2008/07/05/new-bmw-7-series-f01-specifications-and-photos/ |title=New BMW 7-Series F01 Specifications and Photos |dateformat=mdy |accessdate=July 5 2008 |author=Paul Tan |date=July 5, 2008 |work=Paul Tan's Automotive News }}</ref> It now looks more conventional and less controversial than the vehicle it replaces. The interior has also been reworked and the column-mounted shifter has relocated to the center console.

===Technology and equipment===
The models include a 6-speed automatic transmission (760i/Li;Activhybrid7: 8-speed automatik). Dynamic Drive Control with optional Adaptive Drive added COMFORT setting in addition to Comfort, NORMAL, SPORT and SPORT+ modes, with reduced stability control intervention in the SPORT+ setting and in the traction mode.

The cargo capacity is 500 litres. Optional features include 4-zone automatic air conditioning, telecommunication and navigation systems, a USB port, an 80 GB hard disc for navigation data and music collection, a multi-channel audio system, a DAB double tuner, a DVD entertainment system at the rear, a Head-Up Display, an electrically swivelling trailer hook.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/05/22/officially-official-bmw-drops-the-details-on-its-2010-5-series/ Officially Official: BMW drops the details on its 2010 5 Series Gran Turismo]</ref>

===Safety===
All BMW 7 Series' have in series safety equipment: Beside ABS including brake assistant and CBC (Cornering Brake control) pretensioner and belt load limiter on all seats, ESP (Dynamic Stability Control, BMW) with DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) are present. Furthermore 8 Airbags (driver/front passenger, head curtain airbags (both rows) and two sideairbags,front outboard and rear outboard, as well as driver and passenger knee airbags) and active headrests in front. The adaptive brake lights indicate how strongly the vehicle is braking. In the case of an emergency stop, the normal LED running lights (on when low beams are on) are illuminated to the same intensity of the brighter normal LED brake indicator light, creating a large, extra bright light to warn drivers behind. Also, adaptive bi-xenon headlights (low beam) swivel in accordance with the steering wheel for curves, level when going over hills, or when the car is loaded, to reduce glare to other drivers. Also, side turn indicators are standard on every BMW on the front quarter-panels. 

In the 7 Series - partly against surcharge - are several driver assistance systems:

*[[Adaptive cruise control]] with Stop & Go feature
*[[Blind spot monitor|Blind Spot Information System]], 
*[[Lane departure warning system]],
*[[Automotive night vision|Night vision]]
*[[Head-Up Display]], 
*Integral Active Steering (rear wheel steering) 
*[[BMW xDrive|xDrive]] (available only in the 750i/Li, for the first time on the 7 Series) (2010+)
*[[backup camera|Rear view camera]], 
*Sideview (two cameras in the front bumper that look to the left and right) 
*Topview (of the two additional cameras in the exterior mirrors, the side-view cameras, reversing camera and sensors from the PDC to create an overall picture of the vehicle and its environment, and show it from the air) and
*a speed limit display. For this, a camera will check street signs with speed limits. These are displayed in the speedometer, as well as head-up display.
