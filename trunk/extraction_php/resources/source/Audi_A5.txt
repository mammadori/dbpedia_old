The '''Audi A5''' is a [[Executive car|executive]] or [[Full-size car|full-size]] car produced by the [[Germany|German]] automobile manufacturer [[Audi]] since 2007. It is essentially the two-door coupé and cabriolet versions of the fourth generation [[Audi A4|A4]] (B8) saloon and Avant.

Audi bills the model as a [[grand tourer]], to compete against the likes of the [[BMW E92]] (BMW 3-Series coupé and convertible) and the [[Mercedes-Benz CLC]] Coupe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==First generation==
The A5 marks Audi's return to the mid-size coupé market since the (B3/B4) [[Audi 80]]-based Coupe model ended production in 1996.  The B6/B7 A4 spawned a convertible variant but not a coupé. For the fourth generation A4 (B8), Audi decided to spin off the cabriolet and new coupé into a nameplate of its own as the A5.

The new A5 and B8 A4 were based on the [[Audi MLP]] platform (Modular Longitudinal Platform) which is planned to underpin the next generation [[Audi A6|A6]] and [[Audi A8|A8]]. The platform is notable for its departure from Audi's trademark "overhung" engine mounting position over the front axle, in favour of the [[powertrain]] being located behind the front axle - in an effort to achieve a more even weight distribution (52:48)<ref name="specs">{{cite web|url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/audi/a5/2008/specs/|title=2008 Audi A5 and S5 Specs|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> between the front and rear wheels.

The A5 is the third coupe in Audi's line-up, next to the second-generation [[Audi TT|TT]] and the [[Audi R8|R8]].  The A5 has adopted many design elements of the [[Audi Nuvolari quattro|Nuvolari quattro]] concept.  The A5 debuted with the 3.2-litre FSI [[V6 engine]] delivering {{convert|265|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.

===A5/S5 Coupé===
The design was based on Nuvolari quattro concept car.

Audi A5 and S5 Coupé models were unveiled simultaneously in [[Salon International de l'Auto]] ([[Geneva]])<ref>[http://www.audiworld.com/news/07/audi-a5-geneva-first-impression/ First Look: Audi A5 and S5 Debut at Geneva]</ref> and [[Melbourne International Motor Show]]s on [[March 6]], [[2007]].

Ordering of the A5 and S5 began on June 6th, 2007 and the first delivery was made 11 months later.<ref>[http://www.audiworld.com/news/07/audi-a5-s5/ Elegance and Dynamism: The New Audi A5 / Audi S5]</ref>

Launch models included 3.2 FSI multitronic and 3.0 TDI quattro 6-speed<ref>[http://www.audiworld.com/news/07/a5-s5-in-depth/at-a-glance/content.shtml The Audi A5: At-a-Glance]</ref>, with 1.8 TFSI available in autumn 2007.

Early US models included A5 3.2 FSI quattro, S5 quattro. Both vehicles included choice of a 6-speed manual or 6-speed Tiptronic transmission. The S5 model went on sale in November 2007, equipped only with a manual transmission, while the A5 and the Tiptronic went on sale beginning spring of 2008.<ref>[http://www.audiworld.com/news/07/a5-s5-us-pricing/content.shtml Audi Announces U.S. Pricing for 2008 A5 and S5 Models]</ref>

===A5/S5 Cabriolet (2009-)===
{{Expand|date=December 2007}}
Audi A5 and S5 Cabriolet ([[convertible]]) models were scheduled for production in early 2009. A5 Cabriolet included a fabric roof as opposed to a [[retractable hardtop]] as on the [[Volkswagen Eos]].

The engine ranges are same as contemporary A5 coupé models, but S5 Cabriolet came with a 3.0 TFSI V6 supercharged engine.<ref>[http://www.audiworld.com/news/08/a5-s5-cabriolet/content.shtml The Audi A5 / S5 Cabriolet - the Joy of Open-Top Driving]</ref>

The A5 Cabriolet replaces the A4 Cabriolet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060728/FREE/60724026/1041/TOC01ARCHIVE|title=Audi to build A5 convertible in-house, sources say}}</ref> 

Delivery of A5 Cabriolet began in the second quarter of 2009.

The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 New York Auto Show.<ref>[http://www.audiworld.com/news/09/a5-s5-cab-ny/content.shtml A5/S5 Cabriolet U.S. Debut at New York Auto Show]</ref>

===Audi A5 Sportback===
[[File:Audi A5 Sportback rear 20090920.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Audi A5 Sportback]]
The A5 Sportback has 5 doors and a long, tapering roofline, giving it a "coupe-like" appearance. The Sportback model will only be available in Europe, and will start at EUR 36,050. It is designed to be "as emotional and elegant as a coupe, as comfortable as a sedan, and as practical as an Avant" according to Audi.

Early production models included 2.0 TFSI quattro (211PS), 3.2 FSI quattro, 2.0 TDI (170PS) with 6-speed manual gearbox and start/stop system, 2.7 TDI, 3.0 TDI quattro.

Production version went on sale in 2009-09, with additional unannounced models beginning in the middle of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audisite.com/714/audi-a5-sportback/|title=Europe Gets the New A5 Sportback|publisher=AudiSite.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.audiworld.com/news/09/a5-sportback/content.shtml The new Audi A5 Sportback: As elegant as a coupe, as practical as an Avant]</ref><ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/07/15/officially-official-2010-audi-a5-sportback-revealed-not-coming/ Officially Official: 2010 Audi A5 Sportback revealed, not coming Stateside]</ref>

===Audi S5===
[[Image:Audi S5 front 20080703.jpg|right|thumb|250px|2008 Audi S5 coupé]]
The '''Audi S5''' was released in coupe form to the public at the same time as the A5. The S5 coupe currently retains a 4.2L [[Fuel Stratified Injection|FSI]] [[V8 engine]]<ref name="specs"/> that produces 354 HP, while the S5 Cabriolet shares a more efficient supercharged 3.0L TFSI V6 petrol engine producing 333 HP with the new Audi S4.

The Audi S5, in comparison to the A5, features a more aggressive fascia (as do most [[Audi S and RS models]]), including a string of [[LED]] daytime running lights around the bi-Xenon headlamps and a vertically striped chrome grille. In many markets, the S5 includes as standard, 19" alloy wheels with a five-parallel spoke design, bigger brakes, heated leather sport seats, and other convenience features, some of which are available only as an option on the A5.

Changes for 2010 model year include LED tail lamps, the introduction of Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels and new optional equipment such as Leather/Alcantara seats. 

The S5 Sportback was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. The S5 Sportback is expected to go on sale in the spring of 2010 with a MSRP of €57,900.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/15/frankfurt-2009-audi-a5-sportback-earns-believers/ Frankfurt 2009: Audi A5 Sportback earns believers]</ref>

===Audi RS5===
Motor Trend reported that the RS5 would be available in US market.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/09/rumormill-audi-tt-rs-rs5-coming-stateside/ Rumormill: Audi TT RS, RS5 coming Stateside]</ref>  This is, however, completely unsubstantiated in Europe.

It is anticipated that the RS5 will feature a slightly modified version of the 4.2 litre V8 that is found in the B7 RS4, but will have approximately 450&nbsp;hp.  Significant changes in design include a revised intake system with dual air intakes compared to the single air intake in the RS4. There is also conjecture about the RS5 featuring the V10 from the Audi RS6. This, however, is considered less likely as it would put the price range of the RS5 beyond that of its chief rivals, the [[BMW M3]] and the Mercedes C63 AMG.

===Aluminium A5 Coupe (2009)===
The Aluminum A5 coupe is a prototype vehicle demonstrating the benefits of the aluminium Audi Space Frame (ASF) concept. It is based on Audi A5 Coupe 2.0 TFSI with 211PS engine, but it uses the aluminium Audi Space Frame, aluminium and carbon fibre-reinforced plastics body. Punch riveting, bonding or laser-MIG hybrid welding replaced spot welding. The vehicle is 110&nbsp;kg lighter than the equivalent steel-bodied production model.

The vehicle was built by Audi's Aluminium and Lightweight Design Centre in Neckarsulm.<ref>[http://green.autoblog.com/2009/10/01/audi-shows-off-lightweight-aluminum-carbon-fiber-a5-prototype/ Audi shows off lightweight aluminum/carbon fiber A5 prototype]</ref>

In 2009, Audi announced the 7-Speed S Tronic transmission option for A5 with 2.0 TFSI quattro (211PS) in UK market<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/02/06/audi-a4-and-a5-get-s-tronic-gearbox-abroad-u-s-still-waiting/ Audi A4 and A5 get S tronic gearbox abroad, U.S. still waiting]</ref>, which replaced the 6-speed Tiptronic in UK, Germany.

===Receptions===
The car was praised for its design and build quality, but almost all critics agree that it misses the point dynamically, most notably compared with the BMW 3 Series coupé <ref>{{cite web|url=http://fifthgear.five.tv/jsp/5gmain.jsp?mnk=201_1&model=1160&desc=Audi+A5 |title=FiveFWD - Audi A5 review and road test from |publisher=Fifth Gear |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/4car/rt/audi/a5/1782/5 |title=Audi A5/S5 (2007-) &#124; Car Review &#124; Road Test &#124; 4car |publisher=Channel 4 |date= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-review-full.aspx?RT=2733 |title=Audi A5 Coupe - Full Review - New Car Review - What Car? |publisher=Whatcar.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref>
