A revised Polo model (known as the Mark 2 or Mark II, internally designated ''Typ 86C'') was introduced in October 1981, with the major change being the introduction of an additional body style with a steep (almost vertical) rear window, as well a version with a diagonal rear window and a similar profile to the previous model. These two body styles were called the ''Wagon''{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and ''Coupé'' respectively, although in fact both were three-door hatchbacks. The sedan version was no longer called the Derby in all countries, and was changed to the Polo Classic. Production was expanded to [[Spain]] in the mid 1980s following Volkswagen's takeover of [[SEAT]].

1093&nbsp;cc or 1272&nbsp;cc engines were available at launch. In 1986, the Polo received numerous technical improvements; amongst many other minor updates, the engines were changed to lower maintenance hydraulic tappets, new camshafts and valve gear and an automatic choke; the 1043&nbsp;cc engine replaced the 1093&nbsp;cc, and in some markets the 1.3&nbsp;litre engine was available with [[fuel injection]] and equipped with a [[catalytic converter]]. In 1984 an all-new 1.3&nbsp; litre engine was introduced, which was used in various generations of Polo until 1996.

Available with the 1093&nbsp;cc engine the Coupé featured additions such as sporting seats trim, wheel arch extensions, rear spoiler, low profile tyres and a rev counter. The GL featured a 60&nbsp;PS (44&nbsp;kW) engine. In 1985, the first sporty Polo, the Coupé GT, was introduced with a 75&nbsp;PS (55&nbsp;kW) engine, as well as servo assisted brakes, twin headlights, a digital clock, sports seats and a rev counter. Other special feature models were introduced over the rest of the period of the Mark 2 production run including models such as the Twist, Parade and Country.

The Mark 2 Polo was used extensively by Volkswagen to develop future innovations, for example [[supercharging]]. The [[supercharger]]-equipped GT G40 version was introduced in 1987, in [[left hand drive|LHD]] Coupe form only, first as a limited batch of about 500 cars, most of which were sold to VW workers (as a [[homologated]] version of the car for the ''G40 Cup'' race series) and later as a normal production version. This model featured the 1272&nbsp;cc engine with a small bore [[G-Lader]] supercharger, giving 113&nbsp;PS (83&nbsp;kW) at 6000&nbsp;rpm, as well as modified suspension and the bodywork of the "normal" GT Coupé. The car could reach {{convert|100|km/h|mph}} in 8.1 secs from and had maximum speed of {{convert|196|km/h|mph}} it was used by VW to set a number of world endurance speed records — such as the 1300&nbsp;cc class records for speed over 24 hours and speed over a distance of 5000&nbsp;km. A G-Lader would later be used on the larger and more technically challenging [[G60]] engine used in the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] and [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]].

An extremely fuel-efficient 2-cylinder diesel was prototyped in the mid-1980s with a [[G-Lader#Sizes_and_car_models|G40 supercharger]] to overcome its small capacity, although this did not make production. A high-fuel-efficiency model which did make production was [[Formel E]] (E for Economy), introduced in 1983. This used a high-compression 1272&nbsp;cc engine, longer gear ratios and an early-stop-start ignition system (called SSA) that would cut the engine when idle for more than two seconds to save fuel whilst temporarily stopped in traffic, and re-start the engine when the gear lever was moved to the left in neutral. The system could be enabled or disabled by means of a toggle switch below the light switch. Similar systems were later used on the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3]]. Similar systems were developed by other car manufacturers.

===Engines===
The Mark 2 was available with the following engines:
*1.1 1093&nbsp;cc 4-cylinder petrol engine (1981-1983)
*1.3 1272&nbsp;cc 4-cylinder petrol engine. (1981-)
*1.0 1043&nbsp;cc 4-cylinder petrol engine (1983-)
*1.3 1272&nbsp;cc 4-cylinder petrol engine with [[fuel injection]] and equipped with a [[catalytic converter]]. (1983-)
*1.3 1272&nbsp;cc 4-cylinder [[supercharger|supercharged]] petrol engine with 113&nbsp;PS (83&nbsp;kW) (''GT G40'' version 1987 only)
*1.3&nbsp;L 4-cylinder diesel engine (1986-)
*1.4&nbsp;L 4-cylinder diesel engine (1990-)

===Trim levels===
The VW Polo was available in four trim levels;
* Fox (1.0, 1.3 petrol, 1.3 diesel) 
* C (1.0, 1.1 petrol, 1.3 diesel)
* CL (1.0, 1.1, 1.3 petrol, 1.3 diesel)
* GL (1.1, 1.3 petrol, 1.3 diesel)
* GT (1.3 petrol)
From 1987, a basic "Fox" trim level was available with a 1.0-litre engine; this was spartanly equipped as a [[bargain]] basement model. It was also sold as a diesel version in [[Europe]]; this had a 1.3-litre engine. However, neither the 1.3 petrol nor the diesel engines were available in the UK. Otherwise, Versions sold on [[the Continent]] were similar to their UK counterparts; this was the same for all Polo Mark 2 versions up to the 1994 redesign.

A facelift in 1990 (referred to unofficially as the Mark 2F or IIF) saw square headlights, bigger bumpers and a new interior (dash and door trim). The three different styles (hatchback, coupé hatchback and sedan) were maintained. As well as the cosmetic differences, under the skin the car received modifications to the chassis and suspension as well as the addition of servo-assisted brakes to all models including right hand drive versions. The new Polo still had the 4-cylinder engine but now as well as the carburetor 1.0&nbsp;L, a fuel injection model was available with single-point injection and all engines came standard with a catalytic converter to combat tightening EU laws on automobile emissions.

The Derby was only produced in Spain, and ceased production in 1992. At this point, the Polo was now terminally dated. The follow-up model, the Mark 3 or ''Typ 6N'' version, was already well developed, but due to the high sales numbers, production of the other Polo models (hatchback and Coupé) was continued to 1994 in Wolfsburg and Spain. Volkswagen used the extra two years to restudy the Typ 6N and change the format slightly before introduction in 1994.

Soon after the launch of the Mark 2F, another sporting model was added to the range — a new version of the [[G-Lader#Sizes_and_car_models|supercharged G40]], now as a full production model in all markets rather than the limited batch of Mark 2 G40s. The engine used a slightly different version of the digifant injection system to allow the use of a catalytic converter, and produced 113&nbsp;PS (83&nbsp;kW), which gave 0-100&nbsp;km/h figures of 8.6&nbsp;seconds and a top speed of {{convert|196|km/h|mph}}. The car was lowered by {{convert|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} over the standard Polo and featuring special edition Le Mans sports seats, similar exterior styling to the GT with the addition of a bee sting aerial and 5.5J&nbsp;X&nbsp;13" BBS RA cross spoke [[alloy wheels]]. As with the previous model, [[VW Motorsport]] modified G40 Cup cars were sold for racing in a one-make series, the Volkswagen Polo G40 Cup. The reliability of these vehicles was hampered by early production mistakes and high maintenance costs — parts of the [[G-Lader]] can wear out quickly if unmaintained — which damaged the reputation of the supercharging concept. Volkswagen ended its experimentation with supercharged hot hatches at the end of the Polo 2F production run, due to high manufacturing costs and less than enthusiastic sales. The price was little less than that of the basic Golf GTI.

In 1992 VW released a limited number of special edition Polos, with special trim and a G40 engine and suspension. The "Genesis" G40 was made to special order only. A single right hand drive example found its way to the UK. This one-off model was a competition prize when the VW-sponsored [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] tour reached its UK leg.

===Trim levels===
Trim levels were Fox, CL, GL and Genesis. The Fox was the entry-level model, only available with a 1.0-litre engine, but in [[Europe]] it had a 1.3-litre version.

==Popularity in the UK==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the Mark 2 Polo was competing with established British favourites such as the [[Austin Metro|Austin/Rover Metro]], [[Ford Fiesta]] and [[Vauxhall Nova]]. It was unable to match the sales success of any of these cars, but was among the most popular imports alongside the likes of the [[Peugeot 205]] and [[Fiat Uno]]. This was in spite of it being more expensive than most of its competitors, with prices being almost as high as that of larger cars like the [[Ford Escort]] and [[Vauxhall Astra]]. Many buyers felt that the Polo was worth the slightly higher cost thanks to its class-leading build quality, reliability and space. 

As of 2009, 15 years after the end of Mark 2 Polo production, many examples are still on British roads and tend to retail at higher prices than similarly-aged cars such as the [[Ford Fiesta]].
