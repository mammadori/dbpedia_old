The '''Ruf 3400S''' is a vehicle built by [[Ruf Automobile]] of [[Germany]] on the [[Porsche Boxster]] platform from 1999. It was succeeded by the '''3600S''', essentially the same vehicle, but with Porsche's newer 3.6 litre flat-six in place of the 3.4. 

== Model Information ==
Ruf introduced the model in late 1999, both as their first "entry level" model and their first vehicle based on Porsche's then-new Boxster. Unlike Ruf's [[Porsche 911|911]] based offerings, which usually feature the addition of forced induction and new lightweight bodypanels, the 3400S was centered mainly around an engine-swap. Porsche was still offering only one version of the Boxster in '99, with a 2.5 litre, {{convert|200|hp}} flat-six as the only available powerplant. Ruf techs would remove the factory engine, replacing it with a lightly tuned version of Porsche's 3.4 litre, {{convert|310|hp}} flat-six from the early [[Porsche 996|996-generation 911]].

In order to properly handle the new engine, structural modifications were made to the Boxster chassis, both to allow for the engine's physical mounting and to help make the platform more rigid, giving it better handling to go along with the added power output. Larger brakes, an Ruf-spec suspension system and new aerodynamics rounded out major changes, while larger Ruf wheels with more aggressive tires helped increase grip. Ruf badging and interior pieces were added for visual appeal.
