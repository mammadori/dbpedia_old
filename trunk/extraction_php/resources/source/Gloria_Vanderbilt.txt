'''Gloria Laura Morgan Vanderbilt''' (born February 20, 1924) is an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[actress]], [[Beneficiary|heiress]], and [[socialite]] most noted as an early developer of designer blue jeans. She is a member of the prominent [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilt family of New York]] and mother of [[CNN]]'s [[Anderson Cooper]].

== Early life ==
Vanderbilt was born in [[New York City, New York]], the only child of railroad heir [[Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt]] (1880-1925)<ref>{{cite book|last=Vanderbilt|first=Gloria|title=A mother's story|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|edition=first edition|pages=5|chapter=2|isbn=0-679-45052-1|accessdate=December 8th, 2008}}</ref> and his second wife, [[Gloria Laura Mercedes Morgan-Vanderbilt|Gloria Morgan]] (1904-1965).<ref>{{cite book|last=Vanderbilt|first=Gloria|title=A mother's story|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|edition=first edtion|pages=7|chapter=3|isbn=0-679-45052-1|accessdate=December 8th, 2008}}</ref> She was christened in the Episcopal church as Gloria Laura Vanderbilt (and after her father's death, christened in the Catholic Church, to which her mother belonged).<ref>"Reggie was anxious to have his child baptized a Protestant. [His elder daughter] Cathleen had been christened in the Catholic faith; he wanted this baby christened in his own, and I consented. This ceremony was performed by Bishop Herbert Shipman in our large, formal, seldom-used drawing room. ... She was named Gloria after myself and Laura after my mother. ... James Deering was the baby's godfather and Gertrude Whitney was made her godmother ...." Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, with Palma Wayne, ''Without Prejudice'' (E P Dutton, 1936), page 118.</ref> From her father's first marriage to Cathleen Neilson, she had a half-sister, Cathleen Vanderbilt (1904-1944).

She became heiress to a half share in a five million dollar trust fund upon her father's death from [[cirrhosis]] when she was 15 months old.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vanderbilt|first=Gloria|title=A Mother's Story|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, INC.|location=New York|edition=first edition|pages=5|chapter=2|isbn=0-679-45052-1|accessdate=December 8th, 2008}}</ref> The rights to control this trust fund while Vanderbilt was a minor belonged to her mother, who traveled to and from Paris for years, taking her daughter with her.  They were accompanied by a beloved nanny young Gloria named "Dodo", who would play a tumultuous part in the child's life, and her mother's identical twin sister [[Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness|Thelma]], who was the mistress of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|The Prince of Wales]] during this time. As a result of frequent spending, her mother's use of finances was scrutinized by the child Vanderbilt's paternal aunt [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]].  Whitney, a sculptor and philanthropist, wanted custody of the young heiress and soon a famous custody trial became the lead story of 1933.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vanderbilt|first=Gloria|title=It Seemed Important At The Time: A Romance Memoir|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|pages=9|chapter="The Scarlet Sting Of Scandal" (2)|isbn=0-7432-6480-0|accessdate=December 8th, 2008}}</ref> The trial was so scandalous that at times, the judge would make everyone leave the room so as to listen to what young Vanderbilt had to say without anyone influencing her. Some people heard weeping and wailing inside the court room. Testimony was heard depicting the mother as an unfit parent; Vanderbilt's mother lost the battle and Vanderbilt became the ward of her Aunt Gertrude.

Litigation continued, however. Vanderbilt's mother was forced to live on a drastically reduced portion of her daughter's trust.  Visitation was also closely watched to ensure that Vanderbilt's mother did not exert any undue influence upon her daughter with her supposedly "raucous" lifestyle. Vanderbilt was raised amidst luxury at her Aunt Gertrude's mansion in Old Westbury, Long Island, surrounded by cousins her age who lived in houses circling the vast estate, and in New York City.

The story of the trial was told in a 1982 miniseries for NBC [[Little Gloria... Happy at Last]], which was nominated for 6 Emmys and a Golden Globe.

Vanderbilt attended the [[Greenvale School]] in [[Long Island]], [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]] and then the [[Wheeler School]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], as well as the Art Students League in New York City, developing the artistic talent for which she would become increasingly known in her career.  When Vanderbilt came of age and took control of her trust fund, she cut her mother off entirely,<ref>{{cite book|last=Vanderbilt|first=Gloria|title=It seemed important at the time: a romance memoir|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|chapter="Wedded Bliss..." (5)|isbn=0-7432-6480-0|accessdate=December 9th, 2008}}</ref> though she supported her in later years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vanderbilt|first=Gloria|title=It seemed important at the time: a romance memoir}}</ref>  Her mother lived for many years with her sister in Beverly Hills and died there in 1965.

== Personal life ==
At 17 years old, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood where she married agent Pasquale ("Pat") DeCicco in 1941;<ref>{{cite book|last=Vanderbilt|first=Gloria|title=It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=Rockefeller Center, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020|date=2004|pages=31|chapter="The Great Thing" (4)|isbn=0-7432-6480-0|accessdate=November 29, 2008}}</ref> they divorced in 1945.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vanderbilt|first=Gloria|title=It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|pages=36|chapter="Happy Birthday" (6)|isbn=0-7432-6480-0|accessdate=December 8th, 2008}}</ref>
  
Her second marriage, to conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]] in April 1945, produced two sons, Leopold Stanislaus "Stan" Stokowski, born in 1950, and Christopher Stokowski, born in 1952; they divorced in October 1955.  

On August 28, 1956, she married director [[Sidney Lumet]]; they divorced in August 1963. 

She married her fourth husband, author [[Wyatt Emory Cooper]] on December 24, 1963. They had two sons, [[Carter Vanderbilt Cooper]], in 1965, and future [[CNN]] reporter [[Anderson Cooper]], born in 1967. Wyatt Cooper died in 1978 during open heart surgery in New York City.  Carter Cooper committed [[suicide]] on July 22, 1988, by jumping from the family's 14th floor apartment as his mother tried in vain to stop him.  Vanderbilt believed that it was caused by a [[psychotic]] episode induced by an [[allergy]] to the anti-[[asthma]] [[medical prescription]] drug [[Proventil]].

She has three grandchildren by her eldest son: Aurora (born March 1983), Abra (born c. 1986) and Myles, born in 1987.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20141166,00.html "Living with Loss"] By Kim Hubbard and Anne Longley in New York, ''People'', May 1996, accessdate=2008-12-15.</ref>

She maintained a romantic relationship with [[photographer]] and [[filmmaker]] [[Gordon Parks]] for many years until his death in 2006.<ref>http://partners.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000716mag-relations-vanderbilt.html</ref>

== Professional career ==
Vanderbilt studied art at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. She became known for her artwork, giving one-woman shows of oil paintings, watercolors, and pastels. This artwork was adapted and licensed, starting about 1968, by [[Hallmark]] (a manufacturer of paper products) and by Bloomcraft (a textile manufacturer), and Vanderbilt began designing specifically for linens, china, glassware and flatware. 

During the 1970s, she ventured into the fashion business, first with Glentex, licensing her name for a line of scarves. In 1979, the Murjani Corporation proposed launching a line of [[designer jeans]] carrying Vanderbilt's name embossed in script on the back pocket, as well as her swan logo. Vanderbilt appeared in a series of television ads promoting her products, and the line flourished. After Murjani, she began her own company, "GV Ltd.", on 7th Avenue in New York.

In the 1980s, Vanderbilt accused her former partners in "GV Ltd." and lawyer of fraud.  After a lengthy trial (during which time the lawyer died) Vanderbilt won and was awarded nearly $1.7 million, but the money was never recovered, though she was also awarded $300,000 by the New York Bar Association from its Victims of Fraud fund.  Vanderbilt owed millions in back taxes—the lawyer had never paid the IRS—and she was forced to sell her Southampton and New York City homes.

Murjani and Vanderbilt had also sold the rights to her name in the Home Furnishing and Fashion Accessories fields.  Today, Vanderbilt is not involved in the fashion or home furnishings business and is in no way affiliated with the clothing and accessories company that uses her name.

On June 23, 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt's novel entitled "Obsession: An Erotic Tale," was published by Ecco.  The book has garnered media attention for its racy content, including, "scenes involving dildos, whips, silken cords and golden nipple clamps... spanking... Mint, cayenne pepper and a fresh garden carrot.. deployed [sic] in ways never envisioned by "The Joy of Cooking." And there is also a unicorn, though, blessedly, it remains a bystander." <ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/18/books/18gloria.html?_r=1&ref=arts</ref>
