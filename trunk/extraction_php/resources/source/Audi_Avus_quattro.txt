The '''Audi Avus quattro''' was a "[[supercar]]-styled" [[concept car]] from the [[Germany|German]] car manufacturer, [[Audi]].  It was first introduced at the 1991 [[Tokyo Motor Show]].  The Avus quattro had an [[aluminum]] exterior, which made it a lightweight, sleek and safer automobile.

The Avus quattro's engine was supposed to be a 6.0&nbsp;L 60-valve 12-cylinder engine producing {{Convert|509|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, capable of accelerating the car from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in about 3 seconds and a top speed of {{convert|211|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.  The exact car shown at the Tokyo Motor Show, however, had a dummy made of carefully painted wood and plastic for an engine because at the time, such a [[powertrain]] was still in development; Audi-made [[W12 engine]]s were not available to buyers until Audi presented its flagship [[Audi A8|A8]] a few years later.

The Avus quattro is now on display at Audi's [[museum]] in [[Ingolstadt]], [[Germany]].
