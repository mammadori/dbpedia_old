'''Audi hybrid vehicles''' are [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s created by the [[Germany|German]] carmaker, [[Audi|Audi AG]].  Some vehicles listed were [[concept vehicle]]s, which utilised an [[internal combustion engine]] and an [[electric motor]], and were used for [[research and development]] (R&D) for potential future use of the technology into possible [[mass production|series production]].

==Audi Duo, aka Audi 100 Avant Duo==
The original [[Audi]] Duo was created in 1989, and was based on the [[Audi 100#C3|Audi C3 100 Avant]].  It was a [[petrol engine]]/electric hybrid concept vehicle.

==Audi 100 Duo, 2nd generation==
[[Audi 100#Audi Duo|Audi 100 Duo]] second generation was introduced in 1991.  It featured [[Audi]]s' "trademark" [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.

==Audi Duo II==
Little is known about the Audi Duo II.  It was based on the [[Audi 100#C4|Audi C4 100/A6 Avant]], and made sometime in the early to mid 1990s.

==Audi Duo III, aka Audi A4 Duo==
The Audi Duo III was introduced in 1997, based on the [[Audi A4#B5|Audi B5 A4 Avant]], and was the only Duo to ever make it into series production.  The Duo III used the 1.9&nbsp;[[litre]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]], which was coupled with an {{convert|21|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} electric motor.  There was a switch inside the cabin for changing between the electric motor and the engine.  The batteries would be recharged during highway/country driving, or by plugging the car into an AC power outlet.  The hybrid was unable to achieve [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel efficiency]] much greater than the standard [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group diesel engines#1.9 TDI 66-81kW|1.9 TDI]], due to the extra weight the batteries added.

Unfortunately there was little demand for this hybrid due to its high price, and thus only about sixty Audi Duo's were produced.  Until the release of the Audi Q7 hybrid, the Duo was the only [[Europe]]an hybrid ever put into production.

==Audi Q7 hybrid 4.2 FSI quattro==
{{main|Audi Q7}}
Audi unveiled the [[Audi Q7|Audi Q7 hybrid 4.2 FSI quattro]], which uses their [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#BAR|4.2&nbsp;litre V8 engine]], at the 2005 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]].  Audi plans to have the Q7 hybrid as a part of their 2008 model range.

==Audi metroproject quattro==
{{see also|Audi A1}}
In the third quarter of 2007, just before its official announcement at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]], Audi leaked information about "metroproject quattro".<ref name=GCC_A1>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/10/audi-introduces.html|title=Audi Introduces Metroproject Quattro Sub-Compact Plug-In Hybrid Concept at Tokyo Show|work=BioAge Group, LLC.|publisher=GreenCarCongress.com|date=24 October 2007|accessdate=14 November 2009}}</ref>  The metroproject quattro is a [[supermini|supermini/sub-compact]], intended to compete with the [[Mini (BMW)|MINI]].

Under the bonnet/hood is a 1.4&nbsp;litre TSI petrol engine, producing {{convert|110|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}.<ref name=GCC_A1/>  This will distribute its [[torque]] of {{convert|240|Nm|0|lk=on}} to the front [[wheel|roadwheels]] via an 'S tronic' [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]].<ref name=GCC_A1/>  However, in the back of the car, beneath a [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|perspex]] peephole, is a {{convert|30|kW|PS bhp|0}} [[electric motor]] which drives the rear [[axle]],<ref name=GCC_A1/> and can generate an additional {{convert|200|Nm|0}} of torque,<ref name=GCC_A1/> designed to create a [[zero emission]]s driving<ref name=GCC_A1/> experience in residential or city areas, and increase [[torque]] while the [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#1.4TSI|1.4 TSI engine]] is accelerating.

A [[lithium-ion battery]]<ref name=GCC_A1/> pack supports a [[range]] of up to {{convert|100|km|0|lk=on}}.<ref name=GCC_A1/>  In electric mode, the car has a top speed of more than {{convert|100|km/h|0|lk=on}}.<ref name=GCC_A1/>  When both the engine and electric motors are working in unison, the car is transformed into a genuine quattro, with a combined torque output of {{convert|440|Nm|0}} being shared between all four roadwheels.<ref name=GCC_A1/>

[[start-stop system|Stop-start]] technology will be utilised,<ref name=GCC_A1/> as will [[regenerative brake|regenerative braking]].<ref name=GCC_A1/>  As a result, Audi claim a 15% improvement in fuel efficiency when compared to exclusive use of the internal combustion engine.<ref name=GCC_A1/>

A four-[[vehicle door|door]] concept is expected to debut at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in October 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2008/09/15/paris-preview-4-door-audi-a1-concept-expected-to-debut/|title=Paris Preview: 4-door Audi A1 concept expected to debut|work=Weblogs, Inc.

==Batteries==
Audi is planning an alliance with the Japanese electronic company [[Sanyo]] to develop a pilot hybrid project for the [[Volkswagen Group]].  The alliance could result in Sanyo [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and other electronic components being used in future models of the Volkswagen Group.<ref>http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId=101846&topicId=103840033&docId=l:788745336  {{dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref> <!-- all searches of the LexisNexis.com failed to provide any evidence to support this -->
