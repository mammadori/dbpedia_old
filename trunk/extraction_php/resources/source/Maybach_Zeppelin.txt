The '''Maybach Zeppelin''' was the top [[Maybach]] model from 1928 to 1934.<ref>http://www.histomobile.com/1/Maybach/1928/Zeppelin_%28DS7_-_DS8%29_.htm?lan=1</ref>  Named for the company's famous production of [[zeppelin]] engines prior to and during [[World War I]], it was an enormous luxury vehicle which weighed approximately 6600 lb.

==DS7==
The DS7 version featured a 7.0&nbsp;L (7000&nbsp;cc, 427 cubic inches) [[V12 engine]] that produced 150 horsepower. It was available from 1928 to 1930.

==DS8==
Replacing the DS7 in 1930 was the DS8. It sported an 8.0&nbsp;L (7977&nbsp;cc, 486 cubic inches) V12 which made 200 horsepower at a fairly low 3200 rpm, putting the DS8 among the most powerful production cars in the world at the time. Depending on the weight of the [[coachwork]], a top speed of 106 mph was possible.<ref>http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-Maybach-Zeppelin-DS8.htm</ref>

==Revival==
When [[Maybach]] was revived as a brand by [[DaimlerChrysler]], old Maybachs, particularly the opulent 8-litre Zeppelin, saw new popularity as part of a marketing effort which sought to link the current brand with the heritage of the original car company.<ref>http://www.europeancarweb.com/features/0304ec_maybach_ds8_zeppelin/index.html</ref>  This resurrecting of the classic name resulted in increased visibility and popularity of well-restored or preserved Maybachs.<ref>http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z9099/Maybach-Zeppelin-DS-8.aspx</ref>
