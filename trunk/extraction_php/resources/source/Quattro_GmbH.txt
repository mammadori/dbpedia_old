'''quattro GmbH''' is a wholly owned [[privately held company|private]] subsidiary of the [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry|automobile manufacturer]] [[Audi|AUDI&nbsp;AG]],<ref name="Audi.com">{{cite web|title=Audi Worldwide > Company > Investor Relations > quattro GmbH|url=http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/company/investor_relations/for_investors/participations/quattro_gmbh.html|work=Audi.com|date=© 2009|accessdate=4 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="Audi.com2">{{cite web|title=Audi Worldwide > Company > Investor Relations > Audi at a glance - The Audi Group|url=http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/company/investor_relations/audi_at_a_glance.html#Group_structure_and_principal_companies|date=© 2009|publisher=Audi.com|accessdate=4 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='''quattro GmbH''': Producer of dreams|work=elmundo.es|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundomotor/2002/06/05/coches/1023303599.html|date=5 June 2002|accessdate=4 September 2009}} {{es icon}}</ref><ref name="AudiMediaServices.com">{{cite press release|title=Sites|url=https://www.audi-mediaservices.com/publish/ms/content/en/presskit/2009/03/10/audi_konzern/produktionszahlen.standard.gid-oeffentlichkeit.html|date=10 March 2009|publisher=Audi-MediaServices.com|accessdate=4 September 2009}}</ref> part of the larger German automotive manufacturing conglomerate and [[holding company]], [[Volkswagen Group]].

Founded October 1983,<ref name="Audi.com"/> it primarily specialises in producing [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] Audi cars<ref name="Audi.de">{{cite web|title=Audi Deutschland > Unternehmen > Investor Relations > quattro GmbH|url=http://www.audi.de/de/brand/de/unternehmen/Investor_Relations/fuer_investoren/beteiligungen/quattro_gmbh.html|work=Audi.de|date=© 2009|accessdate=4 September 2009}} {{de icon}}</ref> and components,<ref name="Audi.com"/> along with purchaser specified customisations.<ref name="Audi.com"/>  The company takes its name as a [[homage]] to Audi's original [[four-wheel drive]] [[rally]]-inspired road car – the [[Audi Quattro]].

It is located in a 3,500&nbsp;[[square metre]] (m<sup>2</sup>) site at [[Neckarsulm]],<ref name="Audi.com2"/> near [[Stuttgart]], in the [[states of Germany|German region]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]].  With over twenty years experience,<ref name="Audi.com"/> their own development and manufacturing [[factory|factories]]<ref name="Audi.de"/> are based within the larger 10,700&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> site of the now defunct German auto maker (and [[Wankel engine|Wankel]] [[pistonless rotary engine]] pioneer) [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]] (NSU), on what is now known as Audi's "aluminium plant", or aluminium site.

Although "quattro GmbH" as a company may be relatively unknown, its core products include the [[Audi RS4]], the [[Audi RS6]] and the [[Audi R8]].  Furthermore, it is a 'closed company', in that it does not sell its [[automobile|cars]] directly to the public via franchised outlets under its own name, instead they are sold under the Audi brand name.  However, it does now sell 'quattro GmbH' branded lifestyle products and accessories via Audi franchised outlets.

==Business areas==
quattro GmbH specialises in four 'key' areas,<ref name="Audi.com"/> including the [[automotive design|design]], [[research and development|testing]] and [[automotive engineering|production]] of specialist and [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] Audi [[automobile|cars]], such as the [[Audi R8]], [[Audi RS4]] and [[Audi RS6]].

They also design and specify [[wheel|roadwheels]], and design and produce [[suspension (vehicle)|sports suspension]],<ref name="Audi.com"/> and the specialist car body parts (such as front [[bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] and [[spoiler (automotive)|splitters]], side skirts, rear bumpers and diffusers, and rear spoilers) which are mainly used on the Audi [[#S line|"S&nbsp;line"]] trim specification available on most of the [[car model|model range]].

===RS cars===
{{See|Audi S and RS models}}
The Audi '''[[Audi S and RS models#RS models|RS]]''' cars ethos is one of ultimate sports, dynamic ability, and high performance.  They have technology and performance comparable with [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] [[sports car]]s such as the [[Porsche 911]].  Being based on conventional [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] (sedan), or [[station wagon|estate]] (station wagon) cars, RS models also maintain everyday comfort, luxury and practicality, having all the amenities and functions of regular everyday mainstream [[car model|models]].<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/>  They are some of the most [[motive power|powerful]] [[automobile|vehicles]] ever offered by [[Audi]].  quattro GmbH [[concept vehicle|create]], [[automotive design|design]], [[research and development|develop]] and [[automotive engineering|produce]] all RS models in conjunction with parent, Audi&nbsp;AG.<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/>

The '''"RS"''' initials are taken from the {{lang-de|'''R'''enn'''S'''port}} - literally translated to "racing sport", but actually actually meaning ''"motor sport"''.  RS is Audi's highest performance 'top-tier' trim level, positioned distinctly above the '''"[[Audi S and RS models#S models|S]]"''' ("Sport") specification level of Audi's regular model range.  RS cars are usually produced in limited numbers over a limited [[time scale]], and [[innovation|pioneer]] some of Audi's latest and most advanced [[technology]] and [[engineering]] prowess, therefore, "RS" cars could be described as "halo vehicles".  Whilst RS cars generally command a much higher purchase price, compared to their 'lesser' brethren, they also retain very high [[residual value]]s too.

===S&nbsp;line===
[[Image:Audi S-line.JPG|left|200px|thumb|"S&nbsp;line" badge in front grille]]
{{See|Audi S and RS models#Audi S line}}
'''S&nbsp;line''' is a trim specification that allows customers to effect a sporty appearance in their otherwise mainstream [[Audi]] model.<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/>  Whilst the individual [[Audi S and RS models#Audi S line|S&nbsp;line]] parts and components are designed and manufactured by quattro GmbH,<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/><ref name="Audi.com2"/> Audi "S&nbsp;line" cars are still manufactured in the same Audi&nbsp;AG factories, on the same production lines as their related models with differing trim levels.  Cars with "S&nbsp;line" trim should not be confused with high performance "S" and "RS" models.  Audi cars with S&nbsp;line trim bear identical performance figures to their counterparts with SE or base trim levels.

===Audi exclusive===
quattro GmbH offers potential purchasers of new Audi cars the possibility of customising their new car beyond the scope of "conventional" options, to their own personal desires during the initial manufacturing process.<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/><ref name="Audi.com2"/>  This facility is called '''Audi exclusive''',<ref name="Audi.co.uk">{{cite web|title=Audi UK > New Cars > Audi exclusive - style and individuality|url=http://www.audi.co.uk/audi/uk/en2/new_cars/audi-exclusive.html|work=Audi.co.uk|accessdate=4 September 2009}}</ref> and extends to virtually all areas of the car.  The customer may choose unique exterior [[paint]], in any colour,<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/> and be complemented by [[alloy wheel]]s originally developed by quattro GmbH.<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/>  For the interior, the upholstery can be finished in various grades and grains of [[leather]]s (including [[nappa leather|nappa]]), again in a choice of colours.<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/>  These coloured leathers may also be applied to interior door coverings, and rear parcel shelves.  Headlining fabrics can be customised in colour, along with [[seat belt]] webbing.  The interior can be finished with a wide selection of fine wooden trims, sourced from around the world,<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/> along with colour coordinated piping on the edges of tailored floor carpet mats.  Finally, for the traveling business person, a range of in-car [[office supplies|office equipment]] is available.<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/>  quattro GmbH first offered this service at the 1995 [[Frankfurt Motor Show|Frankfurt International Motor Show]].<ref name="Audi.de"/>

===Audi lifestyle / Audi Accessories===
In the current markets, many consumers expect to find their favourite brand logo on objects other than the ''car''.<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/>  From 1985,<ref name="Audi.de"/> quattro GmbH have developed a range of '''Audi lifestyle''' products, known as '''Audi Accessories'''.<ref name="Audi.de"/>  These include [[mountain bike]]s, personal leather goods, such as [[briefcase]]s, handbags, [[purse]]s and [[wallet]]s.  Their highlight is the "Square chronograph" [[watch]].  These products allow Audi owners, and non-owners alike, the ability to express an affinity for the ''four rings'' emblem, in fields other than cars.<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="Audi.de"/>

==Car production==
[[Image:Audi A4 DTM Edition front.JPG|thumb|right|Audi (B7) A4 DTM Edition, one of the cars produced by '''quattro GmbH''']]
quattro GmbH has historically only been able to produce one specific model at a time.  Chronologically, the first quattro GmbH model produced was the [[Audi RS2 Avant]], a [[joint venture]] between [[Porsche]] and quattro GmbH, from 1994-1996.  After this initial joint venture, all subsequent cars were, and still are soley produced by quattro GmbH.  The second was the [[Audi S6#Audi S6 Plus|C4 S6 Plus]], produced from April 1996 to July 1997.  Third was 2000-2001 [[Audi RS4#B5|B5 RS4 Avant quattro]]; the fourth was the 2003 [[Audi RS6#C5|C5 RS6 quattro]]; the fifth was the 2005 [[Audi A4#B7|B7 A4 DTM Edition]] saloon.  Sixth out of quattro GmbH was the 2006 [[Audi RS4#B7|B7 RS4 quattro]], and, as of 2009, the seventh and latest offering is the 2008 [[Audi RS6#C6|C6 RS6 5.0 TFSI quattro]].<ref name="Audi.de"/><ref name="AudiMediaServices.com"/><ref name="Audi.com2"/>

The [[Audi R8]] is built in a new and separate quattro GmbH plant.

===Audi R8===
{{Main|Audi R8}}
The '''[[Audi R8]]''' two-seat [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]] [[sports car]] was exclusively [[automotive design|designed]], [[research and development|developed]], and is [[automotive engineering|produced]] by quattro GmbH.<ref name="Audi.com"/><ref name="AudiMediaServices.com"/><ref name="Audi.com2"/>  An old factory on the Audi [[Neckarsulm]] site was redeveloped, and [[euro sign|€]]28millon was invested in the new R8 production line.<ref name="Audi.com"/>  Around 250 employees work on this car.<ref name="Audi.com"/>

The [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally orientated]] 4.2&nbsp;[[litre]] [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) [[V8 engine]] used in the R8, rated at {{convert|309|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} and {{convert|430|Nm|0|lk=on}}, is shared from the [[Audi RS4#B7|B7 RS4 quattro]], but modified to use a [[dry sump]] lubrication system<ref name="dynotest">{{cite web|title=Dyno Test: 2008 Audi R8 vs. 2007 Audi RS4|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/0704_audi_r8_rs4_dyno_test/index.html|date=20 April 2007|work=AutomobileMag.com|publisher=Source: Interlink Media|accessdate=4 September 2009}}</ref> and induction system.

A new [[V10 engine]]d version of the R8 is now available, using a de-tuned version of their sister company's 5.2&nbsp;litre FSI V10, used in the [[Lamborghini]] [[Lamborghini Gallardo#LP560-4|Gallardo LP560-4]].  This variant produces {{convert|386|kW|PS bhp|0}} and {{convert|530|Nm|0}}.

Furthermore, quattro GmbH unveiled a [[diesel engine]]d R8 [[concept vehicle|concept]], the "R8 V12 TDI" (later renamed "R8 TDI Le Mans").  This was to use a 6.0&nbsp;litre [[V12 engine]], utilising [[Volkswagen Group]]'s long-established [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[turbodiesel]] technology.  This [[internal combustion engine|engine]] was rated {{convert|368|kW|PS bhp|0}}, and generated {{convert|1000|Nm|0}} of torque.

===Audi Q7 V12 TDI quattro===
{{Main|Audi Q7}}
quattro GmbH has developed the most powerful diesel powered [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV) in its class.<ref name="Audi.com2"/><ref name="AudiMediaServices.com"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The World’s Most Powerful Diesel Passenger Car|url=http://www.audiworld.com/news/06/q7-v12-tdi/|date=11 September 2006|work=AUDI AG|publisher=AudiWorld.com|accessdate=4 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="AudiMediaServices.com2">{{cite press release|title=The Ultimate High-Performance SUV - The New Audi Q7 V12 TDI quattro|url=https://www.audi-mediaservices.com/publish/ms/content/en/pressemitteilungen/2008/03/02/der_neue_audi_q7_v12.standard.gid-journalisten.html|date=02 March 2008|publisher=Audi-MediaServices.com|accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref>  The '''[[Audi Q7|Audi Q7 V12 TDI quattro]]''' is fitted with a [[V12 engine|V12]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI)<ref name="AudiMediaServices.com2"/> [[internal combustion engine]].  A world first,<ref name="AudiMediaServices.com2"/> this all new [[diesel engine]] displaces 6.0&nbsp;[[litre]]s,<ref name="AudiMediaServices.com2"/> generating a [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] output of {{convert|368|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}<ref name="AudiMediaServices.com2"/> at 4,000&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], and {{convert|1000|Nm|0|lk=on}}<ref name="AudiMediaServices.com2"/> of [[torque]] at 1,750-3,000&nbsp;rpm.  This is enough to complete the {{convert|0|to|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} dash in 5.5&nbsp;[[second]]s,<ref name="AudiMediaServices.com2"/> making it perform like modern [[sports car]]s.<ref name="AudiMediaServices.com2"/>  Top speed is electronically limited to {{convert|250|km/h|1|lk=on}}.<ref name="AudiMediaServices.com2"/>  quattro GmbH have developed this new engine using existing technology from [[Audi]]'s [[Le Mans]] endurance racing programme - the [[Audi R15 TDI]].

==Comparisons to other brands==
quattro GmbH can be regarded to Audi in a similar manner like the other German car manufacturers "performance divisions" - such as "[[Mercedes-AMG|Mercedes-AMG GmbH]]" to [[Mercedes-Benz]], or "[[BMW M|BMW M GmbH]]" to [[BMW]].

A similar operation called "Volkswagen Individual GmbH" is provided Audis [[Volkswagen Group]] sister company [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Passenger Cars]] at [[Wolfsburg]].  Volkswagen Individual GmbH produce the Volkswagen "'''.:R'''" series of cars, including the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] R32 and the latest [[Volkswagen Passat#R36|Passat R36]], and are also able to provide purchaser requested customisations, similar to "Audi exclusive", during the initial factory manufacturing process.  This service is also offered routinely to purchasers of Volkswagen Passenger Cars 'flagship' models - the [[Volkswagen Phaeton|Phaeton]] and the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]], at their respective [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|production plants]].
