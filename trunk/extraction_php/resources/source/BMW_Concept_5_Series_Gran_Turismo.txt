The '''BMW 5 Concept Series Gran Turismo''' was first displayed by [[BMW]] in 2009 at the Geneva Motor Show as a concept car.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/04/geneva-2009-bmw-5-series-gran-turismo-is-one-luxurious-automoti/ Geneva 2009: BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo is one luxurious automotive hermaphrodite]</ref> It is the first production-destined rendition for [[BMW|BMW's]] [[BMW Progressive Activity Series|Progressive Activity Sedan (PAS)]] series of cars and based on the [[BMW F07|F07]] automobile platform<ref>[http://www.bmwarchiv.de/e-code/f07.html BMW F07 Platform Information]</ref>. The 5 GT is to serve as a combination of a sport sedan, an [[SUV]], and a [[Gran Turismo]].

It has dimensions mimicking in length the [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]], a height and trunk space slightly more than the [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series]] wagon, and headroom comparable to the [[BMW X5]]. The concept was equipped with individual rear seats separated by the center console, whereas the production model will have 5 seats.<ref>[http://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/us02.nsf/fwPressemeldungFrame?readform&docid=799C8B36C8B493A2C125755C0001C92F BMW Concept 5 Series Gran Turismo at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show]</ref>

The production version is expected to launch as a 2010 model, with an expected price between $50,000 and $70,000, during the fourth quarter of 2009. There will be no M5 in the GT 5 Series lineup. There may also be no 550i. The models are 528i and 528i xDrive with the 3.0L direct-injection I6 with 230 horsepower, as well as the 535i and 535i xDrive with the 3.5L twin-turbocharged double-VANOS V6 with 255 horsepower. If production is approved for it, there may also be a 535d with the 335d's 3.5L twin-turbocharged double-VANOS diesel V6 engine with 255 horsepower. There is also talk about discontinuing the 528i and 528i xDrive models along with the 3.0L direct-injection I6 (230 horsepower) engine.  <ref>[http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0905_2010_bmw_5_series_gt_first_look/performance_safety_price.html Motor Trend First Look: 2010 BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo]</ref> 

==Design and style==

The Concept 5 GT features design cues from the [[BMW CS Concept]], as well as new designs indicative of upcoming models. The vehicle has a coupe-like roofline, elevated seating, and a unique "bi-modal" trunk which operates like a sedan or a traditional [[SUV]]. For the first time on a 4-door [[BMW]], the Concept 5 GT features frameless doors. The headlights contain the new LED Corona rings slanted at an angle and extending into the fenders. The concept is showcased with 21-inch wheels and a new liquid metal styled paintwork called Fluid Cuprite, made specifically for the concept.
