The '''Opel Trixx''' (also known as the '''Opel TRIXX''') was a [[concept car]] created by [[Opel]]. It was first introduced at the 2004 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. This city car concept was designed for the traveler's point-of-view because of the many devices built into it.

The Trixx used a 1.3 L [[diesel engine]] with [[Diesel engine#Common rail direct injection|common rail direct injection]]. This also gave the Trixx a top speed of 70&nbsp;mph (112.6&nbsp;km/h). The rest of its engine power has not been tested.

The design of the Trixx was very compact. Like any other [[city car]], the Trixx only seated about four. Although the Trixx was small, it could store things as large as [[bicycles]]. The Trixx featured an inflatable rear seat, power sliding doors, and a roof hatch that can be opened by the push of a button. The hatch could be used to store long items.
