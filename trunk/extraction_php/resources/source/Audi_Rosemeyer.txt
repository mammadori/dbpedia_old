The '''Rosemeyer''' is a [[concept car]] built and shown initially at [[Autostadt]] by [[Audi]] during 2000, and at various auto shows throughout [[Europe]].  Although it was never intended for production, its striking design and highly sporting nature drew considerable attention to the brand, and many potential buyers highly anticipated a production version, to no avail.  It does, however bear a striking resemblance to the [[Bugatti Veyron]] and uses the same engine.

==Information==
The vehicle was designed to evoke emotion and garner attention, and was unique in that it combined elements of modern design with styling strongly resembling the former [[Auto Union]]s "[[Silver Arrows]]" [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] racers, namely their 16-cylinder car driven by [[Bernd Rosemeyer]], after which the car is named.

Powered by a large capacity, mid-mounted 16-cylinder engine making {{Convert|700|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and featuring Audi's [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system, the vehicle promised high performance to match its appearance.  It was ultimately deemed unfit for production, both because of extremely high projected production costs, and Audi's unwillingness to create in-house competition for models from [[Lamborghini]], which Audi had purchased during the 1990s.  In some ways, Audi's [[Lamborghini Gallardo|Gallardo]]-based [[Audi R8|R8]] could be considered the Rosemeyer's successor.
