==History==
The Adler factory produced [[bicycles]], [[typewriters]], and [[motorcycles]] in addition to cars. Before [[World War I]], the company used [[De Dion]] two- and four-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] engines in cars that ranged from 1032 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] to 9081 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]]; beginning in 1902, they used their own engines as well. These cars, driven by [[Erwin Kleyer]], [[Otto Kleyer|Otto]] (both sons of the company founder, [[Heinrich Kleyer]]) and by [[Alfred Theves]] won many sporting events. In the 1920s, [[Karl Irion]] raced many Adlers; popular models of the period included the 2298 cc, 1550 cc, and 4700 cc four-cylinders and the 2580 cc six-cylinders. Many of the '''Standard''' models, built between 1927 and 1934, featured [[Gropius and Neuss]] coachwork. These had 2916 cc six-cylinder engines and 3887 cc eight-cylinder engines.  The Standard was the first European car to use hydraulic brakes, starting in 1926 when they were fitted with an ATE-Lockheed system. 1927 to 1929 [[Clärenore Stinnes]] was the first to circumnavigate the world by car, in an Adler Standard 6.<ref>Michael Winter, Pferdestärken.

In December 1930, Adler assigned the German engineer [[Josef Ganz]], who was also editor-in-chief of [[Motor-Kritik]] magazine, as a consultant engineer. In the first months of 1931, Ganz constructed a lightweight [[Volkswagen]] prototype at Adler with a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and [[Independent suspension|independent wheel suspension]] with [[Swing axle|swing-axles]] at the rear. After completion in May 1931, Ganz nicknamed his new prototype [[Maikäfer]] ([[May Beetle]]). After a shift in management at Adler, further development of the Maikäfer was stopped as the company's new technical director Hans Gustav Röhr concentrated on front-wheel driven cars.

In the 1930s, the company introduced [[front-wheel drive]] '''Trumpf''' and '''Trumpf-Junior''' models, ranging from 995 cc to 1645cc four-cylinder [[sv]] engines. These gained many successes in races, including in the [[Le Mans]] race. The 1943 cc '''Favorit''', the 2916 cc six-cylinder '''Diplomat''' (featuring 65 [[horsepower|hp]] (48 kW) at 3800 [[rpm]], and the 1910 cc four-cylinder and 2494 cc six-cylinder models (with [[Ambi-Budd]] and [[Karmann]] [[bodywork]]) were all [[rear-wheel drive|rear-driven]]; these were built until [[World War II]]. The last new car introduced by Adler was the '''2,5 Liter''' of 1937; it had a six-cylinder engine producing 58 hp (43 kW). Thanks to a streamlined body designed by [[Paul Jaray]], this car could run at 125 km/h (78 mph).

After [[World War II]], a decision was made not to resume automobile construction. Motorcycle production resumed in 1949 and continued for 8 years, leading to the production of the MB 250S. As part of the Allies war reparations, Adler motorcycle designs had been taken by [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] in Britain and later used by the British company [[Ariel (vehicle)|Ariel]] to produce their 'Arrow' and 'Leader' models. Increasingly, Adler focused on the manufacture of office equipment. The company associated with [[Triumph (TWN)|Triumph]] to form '''Trumpf-Adler''', and was taken over by [[Grundig]] in 1957, then later by [[Olivetti]].
