The '''9ff GT9''' is a sports car based loosely on the [[Porsche]] [[911]][http://www.evo.co.uk/news/evonews/207445/porsche_911.html]. It's built by German tuning company [[9ff]], founded by [[Jan Fatthauer]]. The base car is a [[Porsche 911]] (997) Turbo which is extensively rebuilt and fitted with a heavily modified 4.0 litre H-6 that produces 987 HP. One of the major differences from a normal [[911]] is the positioning of the engine. While every [[911]] throughout [[Porsche]]'s history (except [[Porsche 911 GT1]]) has been rear-engined for maximum rear-wheel grip, the GT9 is mid-engined for better weight distribution.

It takes the 9ff 4.2 seconds to reach 60 MPH (2.5 for the [[Bugatti Veyron]]), and 17.6 seconds to reach 186 MPH (0.6 of a second faster than a Veyron). The top speed is 254mph.<ref>[http://jalopnik.com/388902/9ff-gt9-hits-254mph-still-not-worlds-fastest-car 9ff GT9 Hits 254mph, Still Not World's Fastest Car]</ref>

The car weighs 1326 kilos and has a 6 speed manual transmission.

The interior of the car has been stripped out for lightness and is very basic compared to a standard 911 Turbo, with a blue leather, square patterned trim. Inside it has a [[roll cage]] for safety.

9ff has stated that only 20 conversions will be made at a cost of approximately Â£350,000, all of which have been sold.

==9ff GT9-R==
The GT9 is to be replaced by the GT9-R, offering 740 to 1105 horsepower, a variety of transmissions, and aero kits designed for various purposes. It has been designed to take the speed record for a street legal car with a speed of at least 258 miles per hour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=138586?tid=edmunds.il.home.photopanel..1.*|title=9ff Gives You Wings|author=Nick Hall|publisher=edmunds Inside Line}}</ref>
