The '''Opelit Mopetta''' was an egg-shaped, single seat, three wheeled [[microcar]] designed by [[Egon Brütsch]] (who also designed the [[Spatz Kabinenroller]]) in 1957 as '''[[Brütsch]] Mopetta''' using a 50&nbsp;cc ILO V 50 engine and an open [[roadster]] type [[Glass Fiber|glass fiber]] body. 

A single wheel was in the front. The car was only 67 inches (170 cm) long. There were negotiations with [[Opel]] to distribute the car, but only 14 were built.

Brütsch mopetta replicas are now available built in the UK with a modern Honda automatic engine.
