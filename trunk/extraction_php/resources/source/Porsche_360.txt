'''Porsche 360 Cisitalia''' is an [[automobile]] from [[Porsche]] introduced in 1949. The name [[Cisitalia]] (short for ''Consorzio Industriale Sportive Italia'')  is the name of the company that ordered the model.

==History==
The car was commissioned by [[Piero Dusio]] in 1946.  Dusio paid a large sum of money up front, part of which was used to free [[Ferdinand Porsche]] from the [[France|French]] prison in which he was being held effectively for [[ransom]].  Dusio gave Porsche only 16 months to complete the car which proved too short a time to sort out the advanced design.

==Design==
The Dr. Porsche designed unraced 1939 1,482.56 cc (53.0 x 56.0 mm) 2-stage Roots supercharged V12 Auto-Union had been projected to deliver {{convert|327|bhp|abbr=on}} at 9,000 rpm. This provided the basis of the Cisitalia 360 car which was built around a [[Mid-engine design|mid mounted]] [[supercharger|supercharged]] 1,492.58 cc (56.0 x 50.5 mm) [[Flat-12|flat 12]] engine giving a conservative {{Convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 8,500 rpm and a top speed of {{convert|300|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. A fully enclosed streamlined body for fast circuits was planned giving over {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Later bench tests showed about {{convert|385|bhp|abbr=on}} at 10,500 rpm. The chassis was of [[chromoly]] tubing and featured on/off four wheel drive with a sequential gear-shift and a rear mounted [[transaxle]] also sending power through a [[driveshaft]] to a front [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]].  Suspension was [[trailing arm]] in front [[De Dion tube]] in the rear.  Porsche's experience with the pre-war [[Auto_Union#The_Auto_Union_racing_cars|Auto Union]] Grand Prix cars showed through in the layout and design of the Cisitalia to the extant that it has been referred to as the "E Type".

==Legacy==
By the time the only prototype was finished Dusio was out of cash.  The car languished in development until 1951, at one point being shipped off to [[Argentina]] to try and persuade president [[Juan Per√≥n]] to invest in the company.  By 1952 [[Formula One]] rules had changed and while Dusio attempted to source a 2 liter motor for the car a lack of funds relegated one of the most advanced Grand Prix cars of its day to a few [[Formula Libre]] events and quick retirement.  The car is currently on display in the [[Porsche Museum, Stuttgart|Porsche Museum]] in [[Stuttgart]].
