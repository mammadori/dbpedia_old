'''MANSORY''' is an aftermarket tuning company that specializes in the modification of high-end British automobiles. Founder Kourosh Mansory became fond of British vehicles while living in the UK before moving to Germany and opening his tuning shop in the city of [[Brand,_Bavaria|Brand]] in [[Bavaria]]/[[Germany]] near the border of the [[Czech Republic]].

To date, Mansory has performed extensive modifications on vehicles such as the [[Bentley]] Continental GT, [[Ferrari]] 599 GTB Fiorano, [[Aston Martin]] V8 Vantage and [[Aston Martin]] Vanquish. What made the name Mansory known in the tuning world, however, was their bold decision to modify a [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] Phantom. Unveiled at the 2007 [[Geneva Motor Show]] the matte-black Phantom was nick-named the Conquistador.

The Mansory Conquistador was featured on the cover of the July 2007 issue of [[Modified Luxury & Exotics]] where it also received the nick-name Black Banshee. The article goes on to make some extraordinarily flattering comments about the modifications performed saying, "And so it is not without serious consideration that we categorically assert that Mansory, if we may be so bold, has beaten Roll-Royce at its own game; the German tuner offering a more sophisticated and more beautiful vehicle, with even more luxury and a more impressive road presence. This Black Banshee is easily in contention for being the most awesome car we at MLE have ever seen. That being said, such a superlative sculpture can only be achieved when you have the best clay to work with." <ref>''Modified Luxury & Exotics'' Black Banshee , PP. 38 to 46, By Colum Wood.

Unlike most Germany tuning companies, Mansory's main focus is not on horsepower but on aesthetics. Through the use of new aerodynamics, wheels and luxurious interior treatments Mansory transforms already exclusive vehicles into one-of-a-kind automobiles.

Performance is still a part of the Mansory philosophy as the company produces modest horsepower gains through ECU tuning and aftermarket exhaust systems. Mansory's high-performance brake systems are supplied by Italian brake manufacturer [[Brembo]].
