A '''cubic centimetre''' or cubic centimeter (symbol '''cm<sup>3</sup>'''—the abbreviation '''cc''', though widely used, is [[Deprecation#Other_usage|deprecated]]) is a commonly used unit of [[volume]] extending the derived [[International System of Units|SI]]-unit [[cubic metre]] and corresponds to the volume of a cube measuring 1&nbsp;cm × 1&nbsp;cm × 1&nbsp;cm. One cubic centimetre corresponds to a volume of {{Frac|1,000,000}} of a cubic metre, or {{Frac|1000}} of a [[litre]], or one millilitre; thus, 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> ≡ 1&nbsp;mL. The mass of one cubic centimetre of [[water]] at 3.98&nbsp;°C (the temperature at which it attains its maximal density) is roughly equal to 1&nbsp;[[gram]].

In many [[Science|scientific]] fields, the use of cubic centimetres has been replaced by the [[millilitre]]. The [[Medicine|medical]] and [[Automobile|automotive]] fields are two of the few fields wherein the term cubic centimetre was never discontinued in the United States. In the United Kingdom millilitres are used in preference to cubic centimetres in the medical field, but not the automotive. Most other English-speaking countries follow the UK example, but the use of cubic centimetres persists everywhere.

There is currently a movement within the medical field to discontinue the use of cc in prescriptions and on medical documents as it can be mis-read as "00" if poor handwriting is used, which can result in a massive, even lethal, overdose of medication. In the United States, confusion resulting from using "cc" instead of "mL" accounts for 12.6% of all errors associated with medical abbreviations.<ref>
