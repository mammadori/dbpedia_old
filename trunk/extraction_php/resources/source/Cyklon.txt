'''Cyklon''' was a German make of car produced from 1902 to 1931.  It was primarily noted for its unique three-wheeled design.

== Three-wheelers ==
The three-wheeled Cyklon Cyklonette was made for 1902.  It was a three-wheeler with a single wheel in the front to steer, and to provide propulsion from a 450 cc [[Single cylinder engine|one-cylinder engine]] mounted directly above it.  This made the Cyklonette one of the earliest front-wheel drive cars.  Power was {{convert|3.5|bhp|abbr=on}} in the first models.  Later models were equipped with a 1.3 L [[Straight-two|two-cylinder engine]] producing {{convert|6|bhp|abbr=on}}, though some had a [[Straight-4|straight-four]].  The Cyklonette was available until 1923, well after three-wheelers had vanished from the mainstream.

== Four-wheelers ==
The Cyklon Schebera was available for 1920 and sported a 1.2 L [[Straight-4|straight-four]] and was [[FR layout|front-engined with rear-wheel drive]].  The updated Cyklon 9/40 was released in 1926, with a [[Straight-6|six-cylinder engine]] displacing 2.3 L.  All Cyklon models were hit hard by the Great Depression.  Sales were sluggish in the final years, and the company went out of business in 1931.
