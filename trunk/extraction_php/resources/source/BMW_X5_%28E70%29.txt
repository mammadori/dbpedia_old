The '''BMW E70''' is the development name for the current X5 [[BMW Sports Activity Series|Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV)]]. It replaced the [[BMW E53]] in November 2006. It is manufactured alongside the new, 2008 [[BMW X6]] at BMW's [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]] plant in the [[United States|USA]].

==Differences from the previous==
The new generation BMW X5 is {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wider, {{convert|165|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer; with a {{convert|110|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer wheelbase, but remains at the height of the E53 X5 at {{convert|1766|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.

== Technology ==
The xDrive AWD system updates previewed in the facelifted X3 have continued with further detail improvements for the E70. It uses a double wishbone suspension at the front.<ref name="x5athens">[http://paultan.org/archives/2006/11/21/2007-bmw-x5-48i-and-30d-test-drive-in-athens/ 2007 BMW X5 4.8i Test Drive in Athens]</ref>  The [[manual transmission]] is entirely dropped, leaving only the [[automatic transmission]].

The E70 features many new technological advancements for this class as standard equipment including BMW's [[iDrive]] system, electronic 'joystick' gearshift (no mechanical connection to the gearbox to win space in the console), [[LED]] taillamps, and options such as head-up display [[HUD]], active steering, active damping, and Dynamic Drive which uses active anti-roll bars which use a hydraulic servo in the middle to actively counteract body roll.<ref name="x5athens"/>

The interior of the new, larger, X5 is completely new. It has a large center-mounted display screen and the simplified [[iDrive]], a man-machine interface system also found in the rest of the BMW model range. The E70 further incorporates many comfort options such as a glass panorama-roof, and, for the first time in a BMW, an optional third row seat which has increased the seating capacity in E70 to 7 passengers, addressing criticism of the E53 model which had been regarded as being slightly too small for this market segment.

The E70 is also the first production vehicle to use [[FlexRay]], a new extremely fast electrical bus system; it is only used for the control of the chassis damping system.  The new 'joy-stick'-style electronic space-saving shifter has since been adopted in the new 2008 BMW [[5 Series]].

For the 2010 model year the X5 will receive the new iDrive system and the BMW individual audio system along with various other minor updates.

Technical features which are found in other BMW models use also: 

* Active Steering system - changes the steering ratio depending on the speed and driving style 
*''Adaptive Drive'' with active roll stabilization and adaptive shock absorbers 
* [[Head-up display]] - critical information projected onto the windshield 
*''Comfort Access'' - keyless access and engine start to ensure 
* Daytime running lights on the "[[Standlichtringe|Corona Rings]]" around the main headlight units 
* Four-zone climate control 

New is the ''Park Distance system''that can be integrated into the image of the optional rearview camera.

==BMW X5 M (2010-)==
It includes a twin scroll twin turbo version of [[BMW S63]] engine with Cylinder-bank Comprehensive Manifold (CCM). Engine is rated {{convert|555|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|680|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 1500-5650 rpm.

Other features include 6-speed M Sports Automatic transmission with aluminum pull-style paddles on steering wheel, M Dynamic Mode feature, {{convert|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} lower Adaptive Drive suspension, 4-piston fixed calipers with {{convert|15.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} rotor at front and 4-piston floating calipers with {{convert|15.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} rotor at rear, 20-in alloy wheels with 275/40R20 front and 315/35R20 run flat tires, special gills in the front fenders, 20-inch light-alloy wheels.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/04/new-york-preview-bmw-x6-and-x5-get-the/ New York Preview: BMW X6 and X5 get the M treatment]</ref>

The 2010 BMW X5 M has MSRP of US$86,225.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/26/official-pricing-for-bmw-x5m-and-x6m-leaks-out/ Official pricing for BMW X5M and X6M leaks out]</ref>

The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 Shanghai Auto Show.<ref>[http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=10&article_id=8051 2009 Shanghai Auto Show: 2010 BMW X5 M]</ref>

==Specifications==
The E70 has also incorporated two new engines to the X5 lineup. BMW has begun a shift of replacing engines from the 2006 7-Series. The E70 will adopt the powertrains that were launched with the X6 coming in spring 2008.

A 3.0sd model based on the award-winning M57 3.0&nbsp;liter twin turbo [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] diesel engine has been available outside the USA since autumn 2007. A 50-State Diesel version of this power unit will form the basis of BMW's late 2008 diesel introduction into the USA as it seeks to reduce fuel consumption of this large (for BMW) SUV as fuel prices rise, while offering an attractive performance-economy compromise. It is contended by BMW and [[Mercedes Benz]] that in most (i.e. extra-urban) conditions, such modern diesel engines will offer better mileage than full-[[hybrid vehicle]]s in the same vehicle weight/performance category.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

===Transmissions===
All models include 6-speed Steptronic automatic transmission.
