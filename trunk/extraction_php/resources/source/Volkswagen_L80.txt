In 1994 [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] in Europe and [[Volkswagen Truck and Bus|Volkswagen of Brazil]] launched the jointly developed '''L80''' light truck for the European market.

The L80 came in only one specification with a MWM 4.3L 4cylinder diesel motor producing {{convert|103|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} @ 2600 rpm with torque of {{convert|430|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 1,600 to 2,000 rpm.
It met the European exhaust and emissions tests of 91/542/EEC Standard to EG/70/157.

The chassis of the L80 was tested extensively on South American roads and had a [[Gross vehicle weight|Gross Vehicle Weight]] of {{convert|7490|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|3270|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} loading capacity. 
Tyres had a dimension of 215/75 x 17.5 which complied German standards of the time. 

The cab was borrowed from the [[Volkswagen LT]] series with a different front bumper and headlights it gave the L80 a different appearance.

The L80 was discontinued from sale in Europe in 2000 due to stringent European emission regulations.
