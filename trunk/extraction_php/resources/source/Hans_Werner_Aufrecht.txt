'''Hans Werner Aufrecht''' (born 1939 in [[Germany]]) was in 1967 along with [[Erhard Melcher]] one of the founders of [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG Engine Production and Development]], a current subsidiary of [[Mercedes-Benz]].

When the company and the name "AMG" was acquired by Mercedes-Benz in the late 1990s, he used his initials for the name of Mercedes' official racing team, [[H.W.A. Racing]]. In 1999, the first car raced under that team name was the ill-fated [[Mercedes-Benz CLR]]. Since in 2000 the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] was started, the H.W.A. team is in charge of Mercedes-AMG official factory entry in DTM.
