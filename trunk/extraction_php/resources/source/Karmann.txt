'''Wilhelm Karmann GmbH''', commonly known simply as '''Karmann''', in [[Osnabrück]], [[Germany]] is the largest independent [[motor vehicle]] manufacturing company in Germany.  Over the course of more than a century, they have undertaken various roles, from design to production and assembly of components, for various [[automotive industry|automobile manufacturers]]; including [[Chrysler]], [[Porsche]], [[Volkswagen Group]] and [[DuraCar]].

==Notable programmes==
Some of the most well-known cars produced by Karmann in the 20th century are the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] Cabriolet (1949-1980), and, most closely associated with the Karmann name, the [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia]].  Between 1955 and 1974, 443,482 VW Karmann Ghias were manufactured, placing their own [[sports car]]-style body on the chassis of the Volkswagen Beetle.  Later in the 20th century, they assembled the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]], [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]], and [[Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet|Golf Cabriolet]] for [[Volkswagen]].  Karmann also built the [[Ford Sierra]] for the American market, sold under the [[Merkur]] brand by Lincoln / [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] dealers.  Many Karmann produced vehicles carry a small wagon wheel emblem, the coat of arms of [[Osnabrück]], where the company was founded.

Karmann assembled [[complete knock down]] (CKD) kits in an agreement with [[American Motors]] (AMC).<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Larry G.|title=AMC Muscle Cars|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI|date=2000|pages=43–44|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JHVaQFDrx_MC&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=Karmann+Javelin&source=web&ots=d-4c_ixeZF&sig=gIFWywZezPO0uBNRJsIzAM7yp_0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=16&ct=result|isbn=9780760307618}}</ref>  In 1968, AMC introduced the [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]], a new competitor in the U.S. "[[pony car]]" segment.  AMC did not have a manufacturing [[subsidiary]] in [[Europe]], therefore, Karmann assembled the American designed car for distribution in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mederle, Wolfgang A.|title=American Motors - 'Der Karmann Javelin'|url=http://www.american-motors.de/en/karmann|publisher=American-Motors.de|date=2005-12-27|accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref>  Karmann built the cars in Rheine with {{convert|280|hp|0}} [[AMC V8 engine#343|{{auto CID|343|1}} V8]] engines and they were named "Javelin 79-K".<ref>{{cite web|title=1961 to 1970|url=http://www.karmann.com/__C1256DF700512B86.nsf/html/en_69dbbd33fb9bc722c1256dc60034ab21.html|work=Karmann Company History|publisher=Karmann.com|date=undated|accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref>

Karmann is best known today for its work on [[convertible]]s / cabriolets.  It provides roof-components for many current cabriolet automobiles, such as the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK]], the [[Renault Mégane]] CC, and the [[Volkswagen New Beetle]] Cabriolet.

Both the [[headquarters]] in Osnabrück, and the additional facility in [[Rheine]] also construct complete vehicles, such as the former [[Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet]], the former [[Audi A4]] Cabriolet, the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK]], and the [[Chrysler Crossfire]].  A small number of vehicles are also produced in Brazil [[São Bernardo do Campo]].  The Osnabrück facility also produces the chassis and body panels of the [[Spyker]] C8 [[Spyder]].

Other facilities at [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] UK, [[Puebla]] Mexico, and [[Plymouth Township, Michigan|Plymouth Township]] U.S. are manufacturing roof systems for the [[Nissan March|Nissan Micra C+C]], [[Volkswagen New Beetle]] Cabriolet, and [[Pontiac G6]], respectively.

It is one of the only plants that built cars for the second and third-largest [[North America]]n automakers [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] (along with its now-defunct [[Merkur]] luxury brand) and [[Chrysler]].  

A large part of the development of the [[Chrysler Crossfire]] was done independently by Karmann, and the vehicle is produced at their Osnabrück facility.  Karmann U.S. also supplies the top for the third-generation [[Chrysler Sebring (convertible)]] and Ford Mustang Convertible.

==Karmann Motorhome production==
The first [[recreational vehicle|motorhomes]] produced by Karmann were based on the [[Volkswagen Type 2]] chassis, and was launched in 1974 on the late 'Bay Window' chassis.  The bodies of these early Karmann’s were of a sandwich structure, had two beds, kitchen, shower, waste water tank, rear body supports, secondary battery, toilet, hot water heater and gas heating.  It came with an optional luggage rack over the driving cab.  Production of the Type 2 vehicles continued through until 1979, with approximately 1,000 units.

With the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)|Volkswagen Type 3 (Vanagon/Transporter/T25)]] in 1979, Karmann gave the motorhomes a permanent overhead can area with a bed for two people.  Between 1980 and 1992, Karmann manufactured 741 Karmann Gipsy's using the chassis of Volkswagen Type 3.  This number excludes 30 or more Type 3 [[4motion|Syncro]] models made between 1986 and 1989, and 7 Syncro 16" models made between 1991 and 1992.  Parallel to that, 113 Karmann Cheetah's were manufactured, contributing to a grand total of 891 units. Contrary to popular belief, none of the Gipsy or Cheetah production was done at the Osnabrück factory. Production of these models was performed at the Karmann factory at Rheine. 

During the years of 1978 to 1996, approximately 3,103 Karmann Coachbuilt [[Volkswagen LT|LT's]] were produced.  These models were named the LT "M", LT "L 1", LT "L 2", LT "L Distance Wide", LT "L Distance-Wide Gold", LT "H Distance-Wide", LT "H Distance-Wide Gold", LT "S Distance-Wide", and arguably the ultimate Karmann Coachbuilt of the time, the LT "Distance-Wide Autovilla".

From 1996, the design was updated and new Karmann models were based on new [[Volkswagen Transporter (T4)|Volkswagen T4]] and were named Colorado and Missouri.

In the year 2000, Karmann Mobil was sold at Eura Mobil, although Karmann Mobil operates as an independent enterprise within the Eura Mobil group.

In the year 2003, new superstructures on basis of the [[Volkswagen Transporter (T5)|fifth Transporter generation, the T5s]] were introduced.
