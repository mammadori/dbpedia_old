The '''Ruf CTR''' also known as the '''CTR Yellowbird''' or simply '''Yellowbird''', was a limited-production, high performance [[sports car]] produced by [[Ruf Automobile]] of [[Germany]].

Introduced for the 1987 model year and based on the [[Porsche 911]], the CTR featured an enlarged and highly tuned version of Porsche's 3.2 litre flat-six cylinder engine, lightened body panels, an integrated roll cage (adding chassis stiffness in addition to occupant safety), uprated suspension and braking systems, a custom-designed transmission, and several unique trim pieces such as polyurethene bumpers, and the use of the fender-mounted oil filler (a Porsche feature for the 1972 MY only) necessitated by relocating the oil tank forward to clear the intercooler on that side.

Much attention was given to aerodynamic considerations, with the body being de-guttered/seam welded and the use of filler panels for the door pillars and 935-style mirrors. Prototype models had NACA-style intercooler intake ducts over the rear fenders (later dropped, as it was discovered that air was pulled out, rather than in, at speed due to a low-pressure area), while later models had additional slots in the rear bumper corners for the air to exit.

Developing {{Convert|469|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Auto ft.lbf|408|0}} of torque and weighing in it at only {{convert|2580|lb|kg}}, the CTR provided stellar performance, with a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of around 4.0&nbsp;seconds and a top speed in excess of {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h}}. Although a small group of vehicles such as the [[Ferrari]] [[Ferrari F40|F40]] and [[Porsche 959]] were faster to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h}}, the Yellowbird could outperform all competition when it came to top speed, topping out at {{convert|211|mi/h|km/h}}, a top speed that made it the fastest sports car in the world at the time of its release.

The car received its nickname, "Yellowbird", during testing by [[Road & Track]] magazine, whose staffers noted the contrast created by its yellow paintwork against the overcast skies on the day of their photo shoot.

== History ==

The CTR (abbreviation of "Group C Turbo Ruf") was based on the 1987 911 Carrera 3.2 as opposed to the [[Porsche 930|930]], Porsche's factory turbocharged version of the 911, a decision made because of the 3.2's slightly lower curb weight and drag coefficient. Factory body panels including the doors, hood and engine cover were replaced with aluminum pieces, helping to knock an additional {{convert|200|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} off the vehicle's factory curb weight. Shaved rain gutters to reduce drag, fiberglass front and rear bumpers and a pair of intake ducts on the rear flares to allow airflow to the intercoolers topped the list of body modifications.

In addition to the lighter panels, considerable modifications were made to the engine, including boring the cylinders out to {{convert|98|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} to increase displacement from 3.2 to 3.4 litres, adding an uprated [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] fuel injection system, and switching to the ignition setup originally designed for the [[Porsche 962]] race car. A specifically-designed turbo system featuring two large [[turbocharger]]s and twin [[intercooler]]s topped the engine work, bringing total output to {{Convert|469|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Auto ft.lbf|408|0}} of torque at 5950 rpm. The sound from the [[blow-off valve]] was also curiously close to the chirp of a [[canary]], helping the name "yellowbird" stick.

At the time, Porsche offered the 911 3.2 with a 5-speed manual transmission, but the 930 featured only a 4-speed transmission, chosen because it was the only unit manufactured by the company that could handle the turbocharged engine's high output. Not content with only four forward gears and unable to satisfactorily modify the 5-speed unit, Ruf choose to use a new five-speed transmission of their own design on the CTR, which also gave them full freedom to customize gear ratios. To ensure absolute control, an upgraded suspension system, 17&nbsp;inch Ruf Speedline alloy wheels, {{convert|330|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} diameter [[Brembo]] braking system, and [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]]'s Denloc system performance tires were used.

The company debuted the vehicle at the end of 1987 with pricing set at $223,000 per unit, although that number could vary depending on whether a given customer ordered their car directly from Ruf or brought in a unit purchased via dealer for conversion. Ruf made only 29 CTRs from chassis bought from Porsche; most of the CTRs produced were converted from existing customers' Carreras.

A curb weight of only {{convert|2535|lb|kg}} combined with the CTR's high power output made for fantastic performance; 0-60&nbsp;mph in 4.0&nbsp;seconds, 0-100&nbsp;mph in 7.3&nbsp;seconds, 0-125&nbsp;mph in 11.4&nbsp;seconds and a top speed of {{convert|212|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

The CTR could wholly outperform most other high performance cars of the time, including the [[Ferrari]] [[Ferrari Testarossa|Testarossa]] and [[Lamborghini]] [[Lamborghini Countach|Countach]].{{Fact|date=June 2008}} In addition, despite being slower to 60&nbsp;miles per hour, it also had a higher top speed than the [[Ferrari F40]] and [[Porsche 959]], regularly considered the benchmark performance cars of the 1980s.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

It was also a highly competent track vehicle, and for several years the CTR held the lap record at the [[Nürburgring|Nurburgring-Nordschleife]] track, generally considered the most difficult and demanding circuit in the world and the standard test course for all high-end performance vehicles.

== Successor ==

The CTR was succeeded in 1996 by the [[Ruf CTR2|CTR2]], a much more comprehensive vehicle based on Porsche's much newer [[Porsche 993|993 Generation]] [[Porsche 911|911]].
