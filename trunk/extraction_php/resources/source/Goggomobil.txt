The '''Goggomobil''' was a [[microcar]] produced in the [[Bavaria|Bavarian]] town [[Dingolfing]] after [[World War II]] by [[Hans Glas]].  

There was a conventional looking four passenger two-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and a very sleek [[sports coupé]].  The engine was an air cooled, two stroke, two cylinder unit originally of 250&nbsp;cc and {{Convert|15|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} but increased to 395&nbsp;cc and {{Convert|20|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  It had an [[Preselector gearbox|electric pre-selective transmission]] built by [[Getrag]] and a [[clutch|manual clutch]].  The engine was behind the rear wheels. Suspension was independent all round using coil springs with swing axles.

219,531 sedans and 66,511 coupés were built from 1955 to 1969. Between 1957 and 1961 some 700 [[sports car]]s called [[Goggomobil Dart]]s were produced by Buckle Motors Pty Ltd in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>[http://www.microcarmuseum.com/tour/goggo-dart.html A Dart in the Microcar Museum]</ref>

Glas also produced the highly rated Goggomobil motor scooter.

The Glas Auto works at Dingolfing were subsequently taken over by [[BMW]].
