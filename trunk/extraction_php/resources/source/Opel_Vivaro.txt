The '''Opel Vivaro''' &ndash; sold in the [[United Kingdom]] as the '''Vauxhall Vivaro''' &ndash; is a medium-sized light commercial vehicle (LCV or PKW) originally launched in 2001, and is available in panel van, minibus, combined bus/van and platform-cab configurations. Two wheelbases and two roof heights are available, as well as three [[diesel engine]]s and a [[Four-stroke cycle|petrol engine]].
==Joint venture==
The vehicle resulted from a joint venture between [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] (owners of [[Opel]] and [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]]) and [[France|French]] manufacturer [[Renault]], and is also sold as the [[Renault Trafic]] and, by their ally [[Nissan]], as the [[Nissan Primastar]]. It is primarily manufactured at [[GMM Luton Vehicles]] (previously IBC) in the [[United Kingdom]], and by Nissan at their Zona Franca facility in [[Barcelona]].

==Design==
The vehicle is distinguished by its somewhat flamboyant and unconventional front design, compared with its more traditional competitors such as the smaller variants of the [[Ford Transit]] and [[Volkswagen Transporter]].

There was a mild facelift in 2006 during which the front indicators were moved from the front bumper, up into the headlight housing.

==Awards==
The Opel / Vauxhall Vivaro won the [[Professional Van and Light Truck Magazine]] Van of the Year 2006 Award, having been judged against competitors by a panel of van users, buyers and asset management professionals.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
