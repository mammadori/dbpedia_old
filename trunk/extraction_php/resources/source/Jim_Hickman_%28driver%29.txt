Hickman died in a qualifying accident at the second [[Milwaukee Mile]] race of the 1982 season, practicing for the Tony Bettenhausen 200 at Wisconsin State Fair Park.  Published reports indicated that [[Champ Car|CART]] observers and technical personnel determined that a stuck throttle  was the cause of the accident.  Driving a 1982 [[March Engineering|March]]-[[Cosworth]] for Hoffman racing and sponsored by [[Stroh's]] Beer, his racer slammed into the concrete wall in the first turn of the one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) oval. It took safety officials about 15 minutes to pry the 39-year-old former Air Force fighter pilot out of the wreckage. He was pronounced dead about 12 hours later in a Milwaukee hospital. Dr. Steve Olvey, medical director for Championship Auto Racing Teams, said Hickman died of head injuries. Dr. Olvey said Hickman also suffered a broken arm in the crash. The accident occurred with less than five minutes remaining in the final practice session. Hickman was a driver in the 1982 CART [[American Championship Car Racing|Championship Car]] series and raced in 3 CART contests that year as well as the [[Indianapolis 500]], which, that year, was not a CART event.  He finished 3 of his 4 races in the top ten and was named Indy 500 Rookie of the Year, where he finished 7th. Hickman, owned a Nissan car dealership in Chamblee,(Atlanta) Ga.
