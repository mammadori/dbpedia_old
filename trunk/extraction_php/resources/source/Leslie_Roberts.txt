He also writes a weekly column "The Five things I learned this week" in  National Post every Saturday.

== History and family ==
Roberts was raised in a family full of journalists. He has stated "...it was not unusual to have both journalists and politicians at our dinner table."{{Fact|date=July 2008}} Roberts' great-grandfather John H. Roberts founded and ran a controversial reformist [[Montreal]] tabloid newspaper called The Axe,[http://bibnum2.banq.qc.ca/bna/axe/] between 1922-24 and his grandfather and namesake was a writer and journalist, while his father (Bill) was a morning-man for Montreal's [[CJAD (AM)|CJAD]] for 20 years. His mother was an assistant to a federal [[Member of Parliament|MP]]. Roberts' brother, Rob, is [[Toronto]] editor at one of Canada's major newspapers, ''[[National Post|The National Post]]''. 
 
At 18, Roberts interned in the newsroom at Montreal's CKGM Radio, specifically covering the [[1980 Quebec referendum]] and having the opportunity to interview [[René Lévesque]]. After finishing school, he was immediately recruited in 1985 as a medical reporter for [[CFCF-TV]], the [[CTV television network|CTV]] affiliate in Montreal. At CFCF for twelve years, Roberts found himself on a variety of different segments from travel to morning talk shows.

In 1995, a tape of an interview he conducted on his Morning TV show ''Montreal Today With Leslie Roberts'' landed on the desk of an agent in Los Angeles. Within six months he was offered a position with the TV tabloid show ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]''. A year later he moved to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] as a reporter/anchor for [[WNYW]] in [[New York City]]. Three years later Roberts answered a call from CFCF to return home as anchor/host of several shows. In 2000, The Global Television Network came calling. He was news director and senior anchor at [[CKMI-TV|Global Quebec]] until Global offered a position on the anchor desk in Toronto.

== Present work ==
In September 2001, Leslie was recruited by [[CanWest]]'s Toronto division to be a co-anchor with [[Beverly Thomson]] (who has since moved on to CTV), citing that the two of them were an ideal pairing for this broadcast.{{Who|date=July 2008}} Roberts arrived just a week before the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]]. The news team included meteorologist Michael Kuss (now at [[CITY-TV]]) and sports director Jim Tatti.  In 2009, Roberts continues working at ''News Hour'' on Global. His previous co-anchor was [[Anne-Marie Mediwake]]. He hosts ''The Leslie Roberts Show'' from 10 a.m. to noon on [[CFRB]]. Adult listeners of ''The Leslie Roberts Show'' have increased 40.2% in the Fall BBM Ratings. Female listeners of the show aged 25–54 have increased 174% in the Winter BBM Ratings.
