In an April 2009 interview with ''Automotive News'', Stefan Jacoby, CEO of [[Volkswagen Group of America]], stated that the NMS will be available in Spring 2011, and will have a price tag in the range of $20,000.<ref name="AutoBlog">{{cite web|title=REPORT: New VW mid-size sedan to start at $20,000, arrive in 2012|work=Automotive News|publisher=AutoBlog.com|date=April 2009|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/27/report-new-vw-mid-size-sedan-to-start-at-20-000-arrive-in-201|accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>  He also mentioned that the design of the NMS has been finalised, and is assumed to based on the leaked sketch that has hit the internet recently.<ref>{{cite web|title=First sketch emerges of Volkswagen's New Mid-Size Sedan from Tennesee|work=WRCBtv|publisher=AutoBlog.com|date=12 February 2009|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/02/12/first-sketch-emerges-of-volkswagens-new-mid-size-sedan-from-ten|accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>

==Market==
The NMS is part of [[Volkswagen Group]]'s strategy to sell upwards of 800,000 vehicles per year in the North American market, and be more competitive with [[Toyota]] and [[Honda]].  The vehicle is being developed by [[Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive]] and [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Passenger Cars]], and will be based on the latest generation [[Volkswagen Group A platform]].<ref name="Car&DriverSpied"/><ref name=PaulTan.org>{{cite web|title=First Sketch of the Volkswagen New Midsize Sedan|work=PaulTan.org|date=13 February 2009|url=http://paultan.org/archives/2009/02/13/first-sketch-of-the-volkswagen-new-midsize-sedan/|accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>  The company plans to sell 120,000 NMS vehicles per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=VW to add two new sedans in the U.S.|url=http://www.egmcartech.com/2007/11/05/vw-to-add-two-new-sedans-in-us-before-2010/|work=Automotive News|publisher=egmCarTech.com|date=5 November 2007|accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>

As of August 2009, Volkswagen has yet to decide whether the Passat saloon/sedan will continue to be offered in the North American market.<ref name=Car&DriverNames>{{cite web|title=Volkswagen's future products revealed for 2011, 2012, and beyond|work=Car and Driver|date=August 2009|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car/09q3/volkswagen_s_future_products_revealed_for_2011_2012_and_beyond-car_news/volkswagen_27s_future_products_revealed_for_2011_2c_2012_2c_and_beyond_page_2
|accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>  Two possibilities are currently being considered.  The first possibility would have the Passat sold as a premium model slotted above the New Midsize Sedan in Volkswagen Passenger Cars model range.<ref name=Car&DriverNames/>  The second possibility, and the more likely of the two, would have the New Midsize Sedan replace the Passat in North America, and use its name.<ref name=Car&DriverNames/>

According to an October 2009 report, Volkswagen has been leaning towards dropping the Passat in North America as Stefan Jacoby mentioned that the company has been telling dealers about the Passat's likely demise. In addition, the Passat wagon will not continue to be offered in the North American market beyond the current generation as Volkswagen believes the {{convert|9|in|0|abbr=on}} difference in length between the vehicle and the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta SportWagen]] does not justify having both available in the vehicle lineup.<ref name=Autoweek>{{cite web|title=Volkswagen likely to drop the Passat in the United States when new sedan debuts|work=Autoweek|date=October 2009|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20091019/CARNEWS/910199998
