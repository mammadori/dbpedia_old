'''Dr. Kurt Lotz''' ([[18 September]] [[1912]] – [[9 March]] [[2005]]) was the second [[post-war]] [[Chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Volkswagen]] automobile company in [[Germany]].  He succeeded the legendary [[Heinrich Nordhoff]] after Nordhoff died in 1968.

Lotz was the son of a farmer from the German state of [[Hesse]].  During [[World War II]], he became a [[Luftwaffe]] general-staff Major, assigned to assessing needs for the military, which Lotz later looked back on as his first experience with industrial planning on a major scale.

After the war, Lotz worked as a clerk in [[Mannheim]] with the German subsidiary of the Swiss electrical company Brown, Boveri & Cie, which makes all kinds of electrical equipment from home appliances to locomotives.  Within twelve years, Lotz rose to chairman.  He attempted to diversify the firm, by investing in a  small computer company to compete with American computer companies, but when it lost money, a rift between Lotz and his Swiss superiors ensued, and he left.  By the time he agreed to become Nordhoff's successor at Volkswagen, he was thought of as a ''wunderkind'' of German industry for his rapid rise to the top.

Lotz had been scheduled to take over as VW chairman in October 1968, when Nordhoff was to retire; instead, Nordhoff died six months earlier, and Lotz immediately took over then.  He made it VW's priority to wean itself off production of its exceedingly popular [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] when that model began to look dated in comparison to newer small cars in the [[North America]]n and [[Europe]]an markets.  Beetle sales actually peaked in the [[United States]] the same year Lotz took over.  In addition to that, a serious recession in [[West Germany]] the previous year, coupled with serious competition at home from [[Opel]] and from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s newly merged British and German operations, weakened the Beetle's dominace.

Lotz bought out the small German carmaker [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]], gaining its expertise in the watercooled, four-stroke engines and front-wheel-drive layouts necessary to stay ahead of the competition {{Fact|surely VW's salvation came from cars based on front-wheel drive Audi's with their highly efficient Mercedes designed engines.  NSU brought other things to the party, but not the template for the Passat/Golf. The K70 and Ro80 faded away without inspiring anything in the VW family beyond regrets from the NSU fans and a lot of investment in rotary engine research which has yet to see much pay-back|date=June 2009}}.  Work began on a new small car in 1969, a prototype of which was exhibited for the European auto press. The car would become the perennially popular [[Volkswagen Golf]], also known as the Rabbit and the Caribe in the Western Hemisphere.{{Fact|I don't think the Golf turned up even as a prototype under Lotz: surely it was under Leiding, after 1971, that they went full steam ahead with the Audi based fwd Volkswagens (Passat, Golf, Polo)).|date=June 2009}}

At a time when Germany was swinging decisively towards [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politics, Lotz as a [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] man found himself increasingly out of tune with the political mood of the time, while his position placed him at the head of a particularly political company.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197708>{{cite journal| authorlink = Hans-Robert Richarz| title = Die Macher: VW-Manager von Porsche bis Leiding| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 8 1977| pages = Seite 62 - 64 |date = date 13 April 1977}}</ref>     His relationship with the VW trades union leaders was not constructive and he failed to retain the support of the [[Supervisory Board]].<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197708/>   The struggle to maintain management control of the business left him with insufficient time to drive through resolution of the increasingly urgent issues involving product policy:<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197708/> he resigned as chairman in 1971, with [[Rudolf Leiding]] succeeding him.  

In the Autumn/Fall of 1977 Lotz published a memoir entitled "Lebenserfahrungen - Worüber man in Politik und Wirtschaft auch sprechen sollte"<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197716>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ferdinand Simoneit (Ed)| title = Personalien| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 16 1977| pages = Seite 7 |date = date 3 August 1977}}</ref>.   It was reported that those familiar with the manuscript had identified no "indiscretions" concerning his time with Volkswagen<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197716/>.   These reports were accompanied by speculation that his substantial retirement settlement of a monthly DM 16,000 pension would render any printed indiscretion superfluous<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197716/>.

When Lotz died in 2005, [[Ferdinand Piech]], chairman of VW from 1993 to 2002, eulogized him as "a strong entrepreneurial personality" who "set his mind thoroughly on steering Volkswagen into the future."

Lotz received a Doctorate from the [[University of Mannheim]].
