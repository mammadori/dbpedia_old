The '''Opel Sintra''' was a [[minivan|large MPV]] manufactured by [[General Motors]] for the [[Europe]]an market (in the [[United Kingdom]] under the '''Vauxhall Sintra''' nameplate) between 1996 and 1999. The Sintra is one of the second-generation [[GM U platform|U-body]] MPVs (known internally as GMX110s). Its name was chosen by a computer from a list of short, easy to pronounce words and not after the historic [[Portugal|Portuguese]] town of [[Sintra]]. It featured sliding rear side doors on both sides and was available in different seating configurations, which provided seating for from 5 to 8 passengers.

The Sintra is specifically based on the short-wheelbase version of the second generation U platform and has the same wheelbase, front and rear track as the short-wheelbase [[Chevrolet Venture]] and [[Pontiac Montana]]/Trans Sport, and similar exterior dimensions. Along with other U-body minivans, it was made in [[Doraville, Georgia]]. It did not, however, use the [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LA1|LA1 3400 V6]] engine, but rather a selection of Opel engines (which had to be imported to the United States for assembly).

The Sintra had an important influence on U-body development – because GM wanted to keep it similar in dimensions to European large MPVs (like the [[Renault Espace]] or the [[Eurovan (PSA/Fiat)|eurovans]]), the platform was made quite narrow, which in turn made the GMX110s narrower than the previous "dustbuster" minivans, and more importantly than most American competitors. This influence also continues through the present generation U-body minivans, even though none of them are sold in Europe.

Many reviewers and customers found that the materials, fit and finish were below the usual Opel–Vauxhall quality, and also below what European competitors offered – this was only partially addressed by several changes made throughout the model lifetime, like replacing the upholstery fabric for the 1997 season.<ref name="yahoo">[http://uk.cars.yahoo.com/car-reviews/car-and-driving/vauxhall-sintra-2002931.html A review referring to the Vauxhall Sintra as "Britain's worst car"]</ref> The model also proved relatively unreliable.<ref name="yahoo"/>   In 2001 the Sintra, by now no longer sold in the UK,  achieved position 182 out of 182 in a [[J. D. Power and Associates#Automotive surveys|J D Power]] "customer satisfaction survey" covering cars first registered in the UK between August 1998 and August 1999<ref name=TopGearMag200105>{{cite journal| authorlink = Kevin Blick (Ed)| title = J D Power Survey 2001| journal = BBC Top Gear Magazine| volume =Issue 92| pages = Pages 99 - 124|date = date May 2001}}</ref>.

On top of that, the [[EuroNCAP]] frontal impact crash test performed on a 1998 model revealed significant deficiencies – the cabin structure proved unstable and the steering wheel (along with the airbag) broke off, which might have caused fatal neck injury to the driver. Despite relatively good performance in side impact tests, the Sintra only managed to score 2.5 stars (3 stars with one struck due to the fatal neck injury hazard).<ref name="euroncap">[http://www.euroncap.com/tests/opel_vauxhall_sintra_1999/62.aspx EuroNCAP crash test results]</ref> Consequently, the Sintra's popularity plummeted even further, forcing Opel and Vauxhall to drop the model in 1999. Because the [[Opel Astra|Astra]]-based [[Opel Zafira]] [[compact MPV]] debuted at the same time, it is sometimes said that the Zafira replaced the Sintra, but in fact Opel never had a large MPV after the Sintra, and GM eventually abandoned this segment of the European market altogether.
