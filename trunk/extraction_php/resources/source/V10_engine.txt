A '''V10 engine''' is a [[V engine]] with 10 [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s in two banks of five with a distinct exhaust note.

The V10 can be considered to be constructed by mating two even firing straight-5 engines together. The straight 5 engine shows first and second order rocking motion. Here it should be assumed that the crankshaft with low second order vibration is used and the first order is balanced by a balance shaft. By mating the straight-5 banks at 90 degrees and using 5 throws the balance shafts balance each other and become null. The firing sequence is odd (BMW M5, Dodge Viper). Using an 18° split journal crankshaft the firing order can be made even, and the two balancer shaft do not balance each other completely, but are combined into a single very small balance shaft (Lamborghini Gallardo, [[Ford Modular engine#6.8&nbsp;L V10|Ford 6.8 V10]]). Using a 5 throw crankshaft and 72° bank angle the firing order can be made even, and the two balancer shafts do not balance each other completely, but are combined into a single <!-- compared to the last sentence: not as small --> small balance shaft. <!-- OR :-( . I would definitively like a source for this. But as it stands this is no controversial topic and the two sentences just serve to stop the reader thinking about an ideal V10 --> A 36° degree bank angle and a 108° flying arm crankshaft would allow even firing without a balance shaft and smaller counterweights, but are impractical.

The V10 configuration is not an [[Engine balance|inherently balanced]] design like a straight-6 or [[V12 engine|V12]] or a flat-6 or a straight-8 or a crossplane V8 (ignoring the counterweights) and does still have a small second order rocking motion, which can only be compensated by two additional balance shafts.

==Road cars==
Until recently, V10s had rarely been a popular configuration for road cars: a [[V12 engine|V12]] is only slightly more complicated, and runs more smoothly, and a [[V8 engine|V8]] is less complex and more economical.  Nevertheless, modern engineering has made it possible to use V10 engines for applications where a V8 would produce insufficient power and a V12 would be too complicated or bulky.

[[Dodge]] was the first to develop a modern V10 engine, originally designing a version of its [[Chrysler LA engine|LA series small block]] for use in trucks.  However, the engine saw its first production use in substantially revised form in the [[Dodge Viper]].  The original truck version of the engine was eventually used starting in 1994 in the [[Dodge Ram]].  It discontinued in that application after 2003.  However, 2003 also saw the introduction of the [[Dodge Ram SRT-10]], a performance model meant to rival Ford's successful [[Ford SVT Lightning|F-150 SVT Lightning]].  The Viper engine (a 90-degree engine with odd firing order to obviate the need for a balance shaft) has been tweaked through the years, and now produces {{convert|600|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} (447&nbsp;kW) in a standard state of tune from its 8.4 liter displacement.  The engine is also used by [[Bristol Cars|Bristol]], in tuned form, in their two-seat [[Bristol Fighter (car)|Fighter]] [[coupe]], where it can produce upward of {{convert|630|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} (470&nbsp;kW).

Ford also developed a heavy-duty V10 version of their [[Ford Triton engine#6.8 Triton V10|Triton]] engine to replace the aging [[Ford 385 engine|460 big block]] in truck applications.  It was introduced in the [[Ford E-Series|E-Series/Econoline]] full-size [[van]], and also saw duty in the [[Ford F-Series|F-Series Super Duty]] line and the [[Ford Excursion]] SUV, and is still in production in 2008.

[[Europe]]an [[marque]]s were slower to adopt the V10 configuration.  However, high-revving V10 powerplants were incorporated into supercars from [[Lamborghini]] and [[Porsche]].  [[BMW]] and [[Audi]] later unveiled ten-cylinder versions of their mid-range saloons (the BMW 5-Series and Audi A6 families, respectively).  Interestingly, [[Volkswagen]] developed a ten-cylinder engine as well, but as a [[turbodiesel]].

== Racing ==

The most widespread use of the V10 has been in [[Formula One]] racing. Alfa Romeo made the first modern Formula One V10 in 1986; although it was never used in a Formula One car.<ref name="velocetoday.com">{{Cite web|url=http://velocetoday.com/cars/cars_134.php|title=164 Pro-Car|accessdate=2007-12-28|work=velocetoday.com}}</ref> Later the configuration was introduced by [[Honda F1|Honda]] and [[Renault F1|Renault]] before the [[1989 Formula One season|1989]] season. The introduction of the 3.5 litre rule after turbos were outlawed made the V10 seem the best compromise between the V8 and the V12. V10 motors became common-place after the reduction from 3.5 to 3 litres, and V10 engines were exclusively used by teams from the 1998 season. [[Renault F1|Renault]] had a more flat 110° angle motor in 2002 and 2003, but reverted to a more conventional layout (a 72° angle) following the change in rules which dictated that an engine must last two race weekends. In a further change to the rules, V10s were banned for the 2006 season in favour of 2.4 litre V8s. 

There are also cars with V10 engines in [[sports car racing]], usually with [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] powerplants with 4 or 5 litre engines, made available for customers, although the first V10 was seen in the works [[Peugeot 905]], in the final races of the 1990 [[World Sportscar Championship]].
