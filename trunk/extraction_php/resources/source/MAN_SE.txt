==History==
MAN traces its origins back to 1758, when the "St. Antony" ironworks commenced operation in [[Oberhausen]],<ref name=MAN_history/> as the first heavy-industry enterprise in the [[Ruhr region]].<ref name=MAN_history/>  In 1808, the three ironworks "St. Antony", "Gute Hoffnung" ({{lang-en|"Good Hope"}}),<ref name=MAN_history/> and "Neue Essen" merged, to form the ''Hüttengewerkschaft und Handlung Jacobi'' ({{lang-en|"Iron Mining and Trading Company"}}), [[Oberhausen]], which was later renamed ''Gute Hoffnungshütte'' (GHH).  In 1921, GHH bought up M.A.N., the South German predecessor of MAN.

In 1908, the ''Vereinigte Maschinenfabrik Augsburg und Maschinenbaugesellschaft Nürnberg A.G., Augsburg''<ref name=MAN_history/> ("United Machine Works Augsburg and Nuremberg Ltd."), which came into being through the 1898 merger of ''Maschinenbau-AG Nürnberg''<ref name=MAN_history/> (founded 1841), and the ''Maschinenfabrik Augsburg AG'' (founded 1840) was renamed '''''Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Nürnberg AG''''', Augsburg, or in short M.A.N.

The early predecessors of MAN were responsible for numerous technological innovations, such as the first German rotary printing press for newspapers, the first refrigerating machine "System Linde" (1873), and co-operation in the development of the [[diesel engine]] between 1893-97.  In those years [[Rudolf Diesel]]’s invention was realized with the help of the engineers at the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg.<ref name=MAN_history/>

During 1921, the majority of M.A.N. was taken over by the ''Gutehoffnungshütte Actienverein für Bergbau und Hüttenbetrieb, Sterkrade'' (GHH), (founded 1873).<ref name=MAN_history/>

In 1924, the company showed a diesel [[truck]] at the [[Berlin Motor Show]], which was purchased in numbers by the [[Bavaria]]n [[Post Office]].<ref>''Great Trucks''</ref>

During the 1930s, MAN marine diesels were produced under license in the U.S., and installed in their [[fleet submarine]]s, where they proved troublesome and unpopular in the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory'' (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1975).</ref>

Early in 1942, using a hull designed by MAN, along with a [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]]-designed turret, the [[Panther tank]] used by Germany in [[World War II]] was created and deployed in Europe.

===Post war===
After the [[Second World War]], M.A.N. GHH lost all its foreign operations and suffered heavy war damage{{clarify|is this damage from Allied attacks, or war reparations?|date=May 2009}}.  Allied Forces took control of all GHH companies and broke up the company, placing the steel production facilities into separate ownership.  Thus the focus shifted towards the South German plants and commercial vehicles.

In 1986, GHH was merged into M.A.N., with its headquarters in Munich.<ref name=MAN_history/>

The MAN Group took over the truck builder Steyr Nutzfahrzeuge AG (formerly know as [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] AG) of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] in 1991, which also has truck building works in Turkey (MAN-A.S.) and India (Shakti-MAN).<ref>The World Encyclopdia of Trucks, by Peter J. Davies, pub by Select Editions, ISBN 1-84309-201-8</ref>

===21st Century===
On 18 September 2006, MAN made a €10.3 billion offer for a takeover of [[Scania (company)|Scania AB]], one of the leading truck and bus companies in [[Sweden]].  MAN AG bought 15.6% of the voting shares in Scania AB.  [[Volkswagen Group]] (VWAG), Scania's largest shareholder, acquired a stake of 20% of MAN, and has since raised that stake to 29%.  VWAG has a majority stake in Scania, owning over 51% of the company.  It was widely expected that the two truck manufacturers would be combined, and that a combined MAN-Scania would also absorb [[Volkswagen Trucks and Buses]], Volkswagen Group's Brazilian heavy truck (now former) subsidiary of [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]].  A more recent interview with VWAG CEO Martin Winterkorn stated that Volkswagen Group has no immediate plans to attempt to merge Scania and MAN, but he would also not rule out a MAN takeover of VWAG's Volkswagen Trucks and Buses.  However, in the first quarter 2009, Volkswagen Group sold its Brazilian Truck and Bus operations - Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus Indústria e Comércio de Veículos Comerciais Ltda, to MAN SE.<ref>{{cite web|title=Volkswagen sells heavy truck business in Brazil to MAN|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/vwag/vwcorp/info_center/en/news/2008/12/Volkswagen_veraeussert_Nutzfahrzeuggeschaeft_in_Brasilien_an_MAN.html|work=[[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft]]|publisher=VolkswagenAG.com|date=15 December 2008|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>  It was also originally speculated that Volkswagen intended to acquire MAN Truck and Bus division by the end of 2008.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/innovationNews/idUSWEB769220080305 Reuters.com - Volkswagen plans full MAN takeover in '08]</ref>  This has not been officially confirmed, and there has been no current action by VWAG in attempting to acquire MAN shares, or to buy the company's commercial vehicle division.

In 2008, MAN celebrated the 250th [[anniversary]] of the company, with a gala event in Munich, exhibitions in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, the corporate museum in Augsburg, and the ''[[Rheinisches Industriemuseum]]'' in [[Oberhausen]].  One highlight should be an "Oldtimer Truck Convoy" on a historical route from Munich over Augsburg to Nuremberg in June.

On 19 May 2009, MAN completed the switch from a German [[Aktiengesellschaft]] (AG) public company - to a [[European Company Statute]], or ''Societas Europaea'' (SE).
