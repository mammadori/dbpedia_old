'''[[Audi]] Ur-S4''', and '''Audi Ur-S6''' were unofficial names for the original models of the [[Audi S4]] and [[Audi S6|S6]] automobiles.

The Ur-S4 was produced from 1992 to 1994, while the Ur-S6 was produced from 1995 to 1997.  They both featured a 227 [[horsepower]] 2.2 liter, 5-cylinder engine with [[turbocharging]] and an [[intercooler]], with a torque of {{Auto ft.lbf|258|0}}.  In Europe, V8-powered versions of both S4 and S6 were available.  The S4 version sported a {{Convert|280|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine (the same "ABH" engine as in Audi V8), the S6 had an upgraded engine "AEC" with {{Convert|290|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

==Explanation of "Ur-"==
The '[[Ur-]]' is used in the [[German language]], as a [[Affix|prefix]] to signify 'original', and is used informally by car enthusiasts worldwide to refer to the ''original'' <ref name="carautoportal">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-urs4-s6.php|title=Ur-S4 / Ur-S6|accessdate=2009-07-09|work=carautoportal.com}}</ref> [[Audi Quattro]] that was produced from 1980 - 1991 (the "Ur-Quattro").  The use of the term has now been extended to the original S4 and S6 models, to differentiate them from later models with the same name. 

The 'S' prefix letter has signified [[Audi]]'s sporting high-performance production models since the early 1990s.  The S4 was the high-performance version of the [[Audi 100]] saloon, and was known originally as the [[Audi 100]] S4.  It featured a 20-valve, 5-cylinder turbocharged engine and [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]], providing outstanding traction and roadholding in all weathers.  Befitting its status at the top of the [[Audi 100]] series, it was luxuriously appointed and featured as standard a lot of equipment that was optional on lesser models.  The car was available in [[sedan (car)|saloon/sedan]] and [[station wagon|Avant (estate/wagon)]] versions. 

In the mid 1990s, Audi's model designation system changed, with the [[Audi 80|80]] and [[Audi 100|100]] series being superseded by the A4 and A6 nomenclature respectively.  While the A4 was an entirely new car, the first A6 was a facelift of the [[Audi 100]].  The changes were minor and mostly cosmetic, and consisted of minor engine and specification changes, new bumpers, wheels, and front lights for an updated look.  As the S4 name was now earmarked for a performance version of the A4, the updated performance version of the A6 became the S6.  Still sporting the 5-cylinder turbocharged engine, performance was essentially unchanged.  The 1997 S6 was the last production Audi fitted with the famous 5-cylinder turbo engine that first came to prominence in [[Audi Quattro]] rally cars in the 1980s.  There was also a European version called the "S6 Plus", which featured a 4.2 litre V8 engine with {{convert|326|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} first model from [[quattro GmbH]], Audi's equivalent to BMW's M division.
