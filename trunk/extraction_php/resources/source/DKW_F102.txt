The '''DKW F102''' is a car that was produced initially by German manufacturer [[Auto Union|Auto Union AG]] and later by [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen AG]] after Volkswagen acquired the Auto Union brands from [[Daimler Benz|Damiler-Benz AG]] in 1964.

It succeeded the [[Auto Union 1000]] and 1000S models in 1963. It was the last model developed before the Volkswagen take-over, and under their auspices it provided the base for the later [[Audi F103]] models (the "Audi" and later "Audi 72", plus 60, 75, 80, and Super 90).

The F102 featured state-of-the-art two-stroke technology for its time and a unibody of modern design. Nevertheless, the market of the 1960s shunned two-stroke engines as old-fashioned. The F102 in consequence sold below the company's expectations and was the source of huge financial losses. Due to this situation Volkswagen was forced to do a radical cut in 1966. The production of two-stroke-engines was ceased, and the F102 was redesigned to fit a four-cylinder-four-stroke-engine. At this point the name of DKW was abandoned, and the F103 became the first car with [[Audi]] label since [[World War II]].
