The '''Zafira''' is a [[compact MPV]] produced by [[Opel]]. The Zafira is branded as '''Vauxhall''', '''Holden''' and '''Chevrolet''', depending on the market. In [[Japan]], the Zafira was sold as '''Subaru Traviq'''. The car first appeared in 1999, and a second generation model was introduced in 2005.

The Zafira has seven seats arranged in three rows, the back row of which can be folded into the floor to create more space, individually or together, rather than requiring that extra seats are physically removed from the vehicle. The system was named Flex 7.

The first generation of Zafira is usually referred to as Zafira A, as is customary for Opel models. The car was based on the same [[GM T platform|platform]] as the 1998 [[Opel Astra|Astra G/B]] and shared much in common with that car. The Zafira A body was used in GM's [[Concept car|concept]] [[Hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen-powered]] [[fuel cell]] vehicle the '''HydroGen3'''.

The Zafira A was replaced by Zafira B in Europe and Japan from 2005, but is still sold in most other markets, except for [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], where the model was cancelled altogether.

The Zafira B debuted in Europe in 2004, and sales started in 2005. It also shares the platform and mechanicals with the Astra, this time the H/C model.

In February 2006, Zafira B was launched in [[Singapore]]. By March 2006, the model had only been introduced in [[Europe]], [[Singapore]] and [[Japan]], superseding the previous Zafira and the Subaru Traviq, respectively. In April in [[Mexico]] and later in September 2006 in [[Chile]], this model was introduced, branded as Chevrolet Zafira.

=== Names and markets ===
* '''Opel Zafira''' – Europe (except for UK), Hong Kong, Japan, South Africa, Singapore, Taiwan
* '''Vauxhall Zafira''' – United Kingdom
* '''Chevrolet Zafira''' – Mexico and Chile
In Mexico the Zafira was discontinued after the 2006 model year, and replaced by the 5-passenger [[Chevrolet HHR]] (discontinued in [[Mexico]] since 2009).

It has so far been a huge sales success in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], proving even more popular than its predecessor. In 2006 it was the UK's tenth best selling new car, proving more popular than the [[Opel Vectra|Vectra]] that just eight years earlier had been the brand's best selling product.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

=== Assembly sites ===
* [[Bochum]], Germany
* [[Gliwice]], Poland

=== Engines ===
The Zafira B's engine lineup is partly adopted from the previous Astra/Zafira generation, but Opel replaced the old 2.0 and 2.2 turbodiesel [[Straight-4|I4]] engines with 1.9 L common-rail turbodiesels developed by Fiat (Multijet). [[Opel Performance Center]] developed a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}} 2.0&nbsp;L performance version of the Zafira B as well. A CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) version of the new Zafira with a 1.6 L engine is also available.
