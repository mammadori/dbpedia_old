The '''BMW E90''' series is the fifth generation of the [[BMW 3 Series]] range of [[compact executive car|compact executive]] cars. The car is also available as a [[station wagon]]/estate (designated as E91), [[coupé]] (E92) and [[retractable hardtop|coupé cabriolet]] (E93). A high performance [[BMW M3]] version of the E90, E92, and E93 is also available. It is the successor to the [[BMW E46|E46]] model, and was launched in March 2005. The E90 is slated to be replaced in 2012 when a new 3 Series body is introduced.

In 2002, Head of Production [[Norbert Reithofer]] and Development Chief Burkhard Goeschel halved the standard BMW time it took to reach full production of the E90 from six months to three.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_42/b4005075.htm A Role Model For The Team Player ] BusinessWeek - October 16, 2006</ref> First marketed in March 2005, it had quickly become BMW Group's best selling automobile worldwide by the end of the year with 229,900 vehicles delivered.<ref>[http://www.bmwgroup.com/, BMW Group, annual report 2005 (accessed 11 Oct 06)]</ref>

== E46 comparison ==
The E90 sedan is {{convert|49|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer, {{convert|78|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wider and {{convert|9|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} taller than its predecessor (E46). The [[wheelbase]] is longer by {{convert|35|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.  In previous 3 Series models, space for passengers and luggage were common criticisms; however, BMW made significant improvements to the poor leg and headroom in those previous models.  BMW's brochure even highlights, 'Now long legs can be enjoyed even by the people who have them'. Large amounts of [[aluminium]] were used in the body work and suspension in an attempt to keep the weight close to previous models; however, the E90 weighs between {{convert|50|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|lb|abbr=on}} more than comparable older models. The [[N54B30]] engine is all aluminum, while the N51 and N52 engines largely consist of magnesium with an outer shell of aluminum and even aluminum bolts to prevent corrosion from dissimilar metals. The piston sleeves in each are steel and have copper coating.

The E90 also introduced [[run-flat tire]]s to the 3 Series range. Consequently, cars with run-flats are not equipped with a spare tire. While these theoretically improve performance and handling, run-flats cost much more to replace and give a harsher ride.

== Body styles and models ==
=== Sedan (E90) ===
[[File:2009 BMW 335i -- 07-13-2009.jpg|thumb|left|200px|2009 BMW 335i sedan (US)]]
The sedan (saloon) model of the 3 series was the first model sold of the 5th generation BMW 3 series. Debuting in the US in 2006, the E90 came in two trims, the 325i/x and 330i/x models. Later, the US E90 received an engine boost with the debuts of the 2007 328i/x and 335i/x models.

BMW released an [[BMW M3|M3]] variant of the E90 sedan for the 2008 model year. The [[BMW M3|M3]] features the same [[V8]] Engine as the Coupe. It separated itself from the standard E90 by utilizing the E92 coupe's front fascia.

=== Touring (E91) ===
The Sports Wagon (Touring) model of the 3-Series is available with both rear-wheel drive and xDrive AWD. This model features a large Panoramic roof, which stretches far enough for passengers in the rear to enjoy.

=== Coupé (E92) ===
The two-door coupé model of the 3-Series became available in August 2006. It is the second BMW coupé offered with xDrive, after the 325 ix of the late '80s and early '90s. The coupé's body is now its own design and no longer derived from the sedan minus two doors unlike its predecessors, being longer and narrower than its E90 counterpart. The E92 is installed exclusively in the BMW Werk Regensburg.

All E92s also come standard with [[Xenon arc lamp|Xenon HID]] headlights and "retractable seatbelt helpers" that extend from the B pillar to hand you the seatbelt when the key fob is in the ignition and the door is closed. The E92 comes with 320i, 325i, 325xi, 328i, 328xi, 330i, 330xi, 335i, 335xi, 320d, 325d, 330d, 335d and 330xd models (availability of certain models depends on region; diesels not available to the US market).

The [[BMW M3|M3]] high-performance variant of the coupé debuted in 2007. It features an [[BMW_S65|S65B40]] [[V8]] engine for the first time for the public.

The BMW M3 GTS is high-performance variant of M3 debuted in November 2009. It features an modified 4.4 M3 V8 engine with 450 bhp. In addition to engine upgrade it has improved brakes with 6 pot front brake calipers, new sports suspension, light weight body and adjustable rear spoiler.

=== Cabriolet (E93) ===
For the first time, the 3 Series convertible is no longer available with a folding soft top, the traditional fabric has been replaced with a 3 piece folding metal [[hardtop]] roof. The new Coupé-cabriolet is also the center of many new technological advancements for BMW as well as the recipient of many existing safety and performance technologies that have been improved upon for the new model. The new 3 Series convertible improves upon BMWs "Comfort Access" option, by allowing the user to completely raise and lower the folding roof by simply pressing and holding the respective buttons on the [[key fob]]. </br>
The E93 are installed exclusively in the work Regensburg.
The [[BMW M3|M3]] High Performance variant of the Cabriolet debuted in 2008. It featured a [[V8]] Engine for the first time.

On the [[Canada]]-spec 2007 323i an [[Straight-6|I6]] engine block heater is not available—though one can be retrofitted—for the E90, making extremely cold weather starts problematic.

The '''[[IIHS]]''' gives the 3-series a "Good" overall rating in both the frontal and side impact crash tests.  The 3-series received "Good" marks in all six of the frontal crash test categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=561 |title=IIHS-HLDI: BMW 3 series |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2009-04-12}}</ref>  And "Good" marks in six of the nine categories in the side impact test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=622 |title=IIHS-HLDI: BMW 3 series |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2009-04-12}}</ref>  The IIHS also gave the 3-series the ''Top Safety Pick'' award.

[[File:BMW 3er Touring E91 Facelift 20090425 rear.JPG|thumb|Touring (E91) since 9/2008]]
In September 2008 sedan and Touring were updated. Compared to typically subtle BMW facelifts the change to the E90 and E91 were relatively extensive.

The front and rear bumper, the wing mirrors, the headlamps and the tail lamps which return to the classic BMW L-shape as well as bonnet ("hood") and boot lid ("trunk") were changed. The rear track on some models were increased by 24&nbsp;mm (0.9 [[Inch|in]]). The BMW kidney grilles were re-arranged with a wider appearance. In the interior high-quality materials and trim are used, also some control elements were changed. The front seats were equipped with crash activated head restraints.

There were also technical changes to the optional navigation system "Professional", that provided with an internal non-removable disk and high-speed keys (now supplied by Harman Becker instead of Siemens VDO). In addition to the new updated iDrive, internet access (special equipment) was also introduced.

Only the 330d engine was changed. It was changed to the new BMW N57 all-aluminium diesel engine with a variable geometry turbocharger, and will develop 245 PS (180&nbsp;kW; 242 hp).<ref>[http://paultan.org/archives/2008/07/15/facelifted-2009-bmw-3-series-full-details-and-photos/ Face lifted 2009 BMW 3-Series full details and photos]</ref>

The E90 M3 only received the new rear design and iDrive system from the E90 2009 model year facelift.

== Special edition ==
[[Image:Andy Priaulx - BMW 320si WTCC 01.jpg|thumb|[[Andy Priaulx]]'s BMW 320si WTCC.]]
The 320si is a special [[homologation]] version, built in order to qualify the car for the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[World Touring Car Championship]] (WTCC).<ref>{{cite web | title=World Touring Car homologation special | url=http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/evocarreviews/200502/bmw_320si.html | accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> It was released in 2006 and limited to 2,600 units.  The 320si uses a modified 4 cylinder engine ([[BMW N45|N45]]) different from the standard 320i ([[BMW N46|N46]]). Modifications include an increased redline to 7,300 rpm, a shortened stroke (by 2&nbsp;mm), an increased bore (by 1&nbsp;mm) and a higher compression ratio (11.0:1).  The engine is mostly hand built and does not have Valvetronic, decreasing the number of moving parts. Acceleration from 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h (62 mph) takes 8.1 seconds and acceleration in fourth gear from {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} takes 7.7 seconds compared with a standard 320i which achieves them in 9.0 and 9.1 seconds respectively.  Fourth gear acceleration is comparable to that of the 325i which achieves the {{convert|80|to|120|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} sprint in 7.5 seconds.

The BMW 320si is used by [[Team RAC]] and [[Motorbase Performance|Airwaves BMW]] in the [[British Touring Car Championship|British Touring Car Championship (BTCC)]]. [[Colin Turkington]] won the 2009 [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]] Drivers championship using the BMW 320si.

== Awards ==
*In April 2006, the E90 was awarded the [[World Car of the Year]] title by a jury of 46 international automotive journalists. The car was praised for its balance between performance and practicality, as well as between style and seriousness. The jury also praised the new diesel engines and the all wheel drive variants.<ref>{{cite web | title=BMW 3-Series declared World Car of the Year | work=World Car of the Year Awards | date=2006-04-13 | url=http://www.wcoty.com/media/?release=23&year=2006 | accessdate=2006-10-11}}</ref>
*''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine listed the E90 3-series on their [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for the 16th time in 24 years of the list's publication.
*  The E90 was named "''Best New Sports Sedan''" in the 2006 ''Canadian Car of the Year'' awards.
