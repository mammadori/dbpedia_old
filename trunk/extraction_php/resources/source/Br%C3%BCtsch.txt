'''Egon Brütsch Fahrzeugbau''', usually shortened to '''Brütsch''', was a [[Germany|German]] [[automotive design]] and [[automaker]] based in [[Stuttgart]], [[Baden-Württemberg]].

Brütsch were best known for producing a large number of different [[microcar]] designs, but only produced small numbers of each design and the primary function of the company appears to have been that of the development and promotion of each design to sell licences to manufacture to other companies.

Between 1952 and 1958, eleven different models of car were manufactured by Brütsch, but the total production of all models by the company is believed to be only eighty-one cars.

Many of the bodywork designs were simple two-piece mouldings of [[polyester]] reinforced with [[fiberglass]], bonded at a waistline join, which was then covered by a protective strip. [[Chassis]] and [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] design was very rudimentary and after a misguided court action in 1956 by Brütsch against a licensee, at least one of Brütsch's designs was condemned as dangerous.
The abbreviated chassis's used on the majority of the cars meant that for structural integrity they could not have doors and all these models had low sides to facilitate entry and exit.

A 3-seater, 3-wheeled [[roadster]], powered by a single cylinder 191&nbsp;cc [[Fichtel & Sachs]] engine driving through a four speed gearbox. Top speed was around {{convert|90|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and about five cars were produced. Also built under licence by A. Grünhut & Co of [[Switzerland]] with minor changes and sold as the Belcar. Another licence was sold to Alzmetall for production by Harald Friedrich GmbH of Germany, but so many faults were found with the original design that their production model, the [[Spatz Kabinenroller]] was fundamentally a different car. Because of this Brütsch took Alzmetall to court to ensure payment of his licence fees but lost the case.
