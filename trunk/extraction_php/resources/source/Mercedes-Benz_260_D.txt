The '''Mercedes-Benz 260 D''' was the second [[diesel engine]]d production passenger car and was introduced in 1936. It was named in reference to its engine's cubic capacity. Nearly 2,000 vehicles were assembled until 1940, when the [[Daimler-Benz]] group had to devote itself entirely to military manufacture. 

The 2545&nbsp;cc [[overhead valve]], 4 cylinder engine employed the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] diesel injection system and produced {{convert|45|bhp|abbr=on}} at 3000&nbsp;rpm. The car weighed approximately 1530 kg and could attain a top speed of 95 km/h. 

The chassis was based on contemporary Mercedes technology and had transverse [[leaf spring]] independent front suspension and [[swing axle]]s at the rear.  The brakes were hydraulic. A range of body types were made including saloons, [[landaulette]]s and [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolets]].

Two series were manufactured, 170 pullman-landaulets used only as taxis based on the W21 chassis, called the ''Nullserie'' from 1936 to 1937, with a three speed plus overdrive transmission, without syncromesh on the first gear, and, from 1937 on, the regular production 260D based on the W143 chassis, with a four speed fully synchronized transmission.
 
A surviving example of the car is displayed at the [[Mercedes-Benz]] museum in Germany.
