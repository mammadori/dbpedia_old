The '''BMW X6 M''' is a proposed [[Sport Activity Coupe]] to be  introduced by the [[BMW M]] GmbH. 

Mr. Ludwig Willisch, Head  of BMW M GmbH, confirmed in an interview with the German automotive press in July 2008 that there would be a BMW X6 M.  This was further confirmed in December 2008 in an interview on the M Power World with Mr. Albert Biermann, Head of Engineering M GmbH. The addition of the BMW X6 M Sports Activity Coupe´ extends the BMW M line up, currently consisting of variants of the M3, M5 and M6. BMW officially revealed of its BMW X6 M high-performance crossover at the New York Auto Show (Apr 09-19, 2009). Built to compete with Porsche’s Cayenne Turbo S, Mercedes ML63 AMG and other high-performance crossovers, the BMW X6 M may very well be in a class of it’s own: a high-performance Sport Activity Coupe. At the time of its launch it is the world's most powerful car in its class.

== Performance ==

The BMW X6 M uses a version of BMW’s latest twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8. Output is pegged at 555 horsepower at 5,750 rpm and peak torque is 501 pound-feet, available between 1,500 and 5,650 rpm. The car can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds, according to BMW.

== Advanced technology ==

The BMW X6 M and BMW X5 M are the first xDrive all-wheel-drive vehicles from the M GmbH, BMW’s . Coupled with special  suspension specificall optimized for M that features Adaptive Drive and the newly developed M Servotronic power steering, the performance Sport Activity Vehicle promises very competent handling. Other high-tech features include launch control for maximum acceleration and a six speed  M  Sport automatic transmission optimized for performance. Drivers can manually select gears using either paddles or an an electronic gear selector lever.
Electronically controlled, variable power distribution to the front and rear axle prevents even the slightest tendency to over- or understeer right from the start, before DSC Dynamic Stability Control is even required to cut in.
BMW is referring to the new 4.4-liter motor as its “M TwinPower Turbo” unit. The name reflects the fact that the motor features Twin Scroll Twin Turbo Technology and a common exhaust manifold encompassing both rows of cylinders.
Although traction control is standard, the M Dynamic Mode (MDM) greatly optimises the aggressiveness of the system. The MDM setting allows the driver to enter a controlled drift and push the vehicle’s handling to the limit. There’s also a DSC-Off Mode for drivers seeking a more purist experience.

== The first modern turbocharged M engine: twin scroll twin turbo technology with a patented exhaust manifold ==

Using BMW’s innovative, “M TwinPower Turbo” unit with High Precision Direct Injection and twin turbochargers as a basis, the new M engine introduces twin-scroll twin turbochargers and patented exhaust manifold technologies to achieve outstanding thrust and pulling force, while preserving the most compact dimensions possible. Two low-mass twin-scroll turbochargers are positioned together with the catalytic converters in the “V” section between the two banks of cylinders. By reversing the flow of gases through the engine from traditional arrangements, the intake and exhaust ducts are shortened and widened. The result is that pressure losses on the exhaust side are minimized. 
The goals: virtually eliminate turbocharger lag while maximizing combustion efficiency and power output. Tremendous power and performance are delivered by the engine in the BMW X5 M and BMW X6 M through a new design and construction principle. The new M V8 engine with twin-scroll twin turbo technology uses a single exhaust manifold with tuned-length runners, incorporating both cylinder banks and connecting cylinders in carefully-selected pairs. This configuration, patented by BMW M and known as Cylinder-bank Comprehensive Manifold (CCM), offers lightning-quick response, a linear build-up of engine power, and a broad, consistent torque curve by feeding each of the twin turbochargers with a “charge pulse” at approximately every 90 degrees of crankshaft rotation, rather than the more traditional “irregular schedule” of charging. 
The managed flow of exhaust gas provided by the CCM ensures high-velocity flow of combustion gases. The appropriate separation of exhaust gas flow from different cylinders is maintained until the gas reaches the turbine wheel, spooling the two twin-scroll turbochargers without back-pressure. With maximum boost pressure of 1.5 bar (21 psi), the use of twin-scroll twin turbo technology and the CCM exhaust manifold allows complete exploitation of the benefits of turbocharging.
