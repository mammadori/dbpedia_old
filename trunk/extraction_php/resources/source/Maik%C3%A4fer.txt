'''Maikäfer''' was the nickname of an [[automobile]] [[prototype]], built in [[1931]] by German engineer [[Josef Ganz]] at [[Adler (automobile)|Adler]].

==History==
Josef Ganz, an independent engineer and editor-in-chief of [[Motor-Kritik]] magazine, was assigned by Adler in December [[1930]] as a consultant engineer. In the first months of 1931, Ganz constructed a lightweight [[Volkswagen]] prototype at Adler with a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and [[Independent suspension|independent wheel suspension]] with [[Swing axle|swing-axles]] at the rear. After completion in May 1931, Ganz nicknamed his new prototype Maikäfer ([[May Beetle]]).<ref>"''Eine Seite "Maikäfer"''", ''Motor-Kritik'', issue 21, early November 1931.</ref>

After a shift in management, further development of the Maikäfer was stopped towards the end of 1931 and Adler concentrated on new car models with front-wheel drive. Josef Ganz was allowed to keep the Maikäfer prototype and kept on using it as his personal car and demonstration model for his patented Volkswagen design until around 1950.

==The Maikäfer today==
In the 1990s, the original Maikäfer prototype was discovered in [[Switzerland]] by a German collector and restored to its original condition.

==The Volkswagen Beetle connection==
With the [[Ardie-Ganz]], Adler Maikäfer and [[Standard Superior]] cars, as well as his progressive writings and promotion of the concept of a Volkswagen in [[Motor-Kritik]] magazine since the 1920s, Josef ganz is claimed by some to be the inspiration behind the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. But he could not build the car in Hitler's  Germany, because he was Jewish. So Ferdinand Porsche, a designer much admired by Hitler, got to connect his name to the "People's Car" (Volkswagen) the regime needed to appease the masses.

==New investigation==
While the Volkswagen Beetle was produced in its millions after World War Two, the name of Josef Ganz was largely forgotten. In 2004, Dutch journalist [[Paul Schilperoord]] started researching the life and work of Josef Ganz. He has unearthed many new facts and is currently working on a new book and documentary.
