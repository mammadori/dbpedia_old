[[File:FormulaPalmer Audi Blah!.jpg|thumb|268px|A Formula Palmer Audi car]]
'''Formula Palmer Audi''', commonly known as '''Palmer Audi''' or '''FPA''', is a form of [[open wheel racing]] founded in 1998 by former [[Formula One]] driver, [[Jonathan Palmer]].  It is based in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), and has a high proportion of British drivers and venues, but it also features international drivers and races in Continental Europe.  The series is most famous for producing ex-F1 driver and IndyCar race-winner [[Justin Wilson]] and triple World Touring Car Champion [[Andy Priaulx]].

==Introduction==
The cars are powered by a [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#1.8 20vT 110-176kW|1.8&nbsp;litre, inline-four cylinder]], {{convert|300|bhp|kW PS|0|lk=on}} [[turbocharger|Turbocharged]] [[Audi]] production engine, capable of over {{convert|150|mph|0|lk=on}}.  The cars also feature a turbo 'boost' button, which temporarily gives the car a {{convert|60|bhp|kW PS|0}} increase.  The body is made of [[aluminium]] honeycomb [[monocoque]], the basic structure of which complies with the current [[FIA]] [[Formula 3]] safety regulations.  The car was manufactured by, and based on an original design by [[Van Diemen]] International.

The series was originally set up as a cost-effective rival to [[Formula 3]] in the UK.  After a brief foray into [[Europe]], FPA evolved into a series predominantly for gentleman drivers looking to combine business with pleasure.{{fact|date=July 2009}}

However, having produced nominees for the prestigious [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] [[Autosport]] Young Driver Award for five consecutive years from 2004 to 2008, including 2007 winner Stefan Wilson, FPA is re-emerging as a viable option for young aspiring drivers on the path to [[Formula One]].  This has been aided by recent scholarship deals that have been announced between FPA and the Stars of Tomorrow karting programme, and between FPA and the [[FIA Formula Two Championship]], which have established a clear progression path for young drivers into top-level single seaters.

FPA still maintains itself as a cost-effective form of open wheel racing, with the [[2009 Formula Palmer Audi season|2009 season]] costing driver [[British pound|£]]55,000 plus [[VAT]],<ref>Formula-Palmer-Audi.com [http://www.formula-palmer-audi.com/ 2009 FPA brochure and pricing]</ref> whereas similar series such as [[Formula Renault]] or [[Formula BMW]] require estimated budgets two to three times higher in order to race with a front-running team.{{fact|date=July 2009}}

==FPA race weekend==
FPA race weekends normally take place over two days, but may be spread over three if the series is supporting an international event such as [[A1GP]], [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (DTM) or the [[World Touring Car Championship]].  After free practice, drivers take part in two 20-minute qualifying sessions, for which they have an unlimited number of laps at their disposal.  The first qualifying session sets the grid for Race 1, while the second sets the grid for Race 2.

Races are 35 miles in length, with a time limit of 30 minutes.  In the event of three races being held over a weekend, each driver's fastest lap from Race 2 counts at their qualifying time for Race 3.

Points are awarded to the first 19 finishers of each race in the following order:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!Position || 1st||2nd||3rd||4th||5th||6th||7th||8th||9th||10th||11th||12th||13th||14th||15th||16th||17th||18th||19th
|-
!Points || 24||20||18||16||15||14||13||12||11||10||9||8||7||6||5||4||3||2||1
|}

Drivers must take the chequered flag to score points.  Retirees do not score, even if fewer than 19 drivers finish the race.

Another interesting feature is that each driver is supplied with just one set of [[slick tire|slick]] [[Cooper Tire & Rubber Company|Avon]] tyres to last them for the entire weekend of practice, qualifying and racing. While tyres may be replaced in the event of puncture, extensive damage or safety issues, any 'flat-spotting' of tyres done by a driver is not sufficient for an exchange.

==Features of Formula Palmer Audi==
Formula Palmer Audi has always been run as an 'arrive-and-drive' series, and was one of the first major motor-racing series to do so.  In order to keep a level playing field as much as possible, all the cars are run by a specialist team of FPA mechanics, rather than having separate teams.  This concept of a large group of deliberately-equalised cars has since been adopted by [[A1 Grand Prix]].

The series has raced on many different circuits in the UK and Europe throughout its ten-year history.  These include the following:

FPA championships are also known for close title battles.  In 2004, [[Jonathan Kennard]] beat [[Rob Jenkinson]] to the series title by just two points.  The following year [[Joe Tandy]] and [[David Epton]] finished tied on points, Tandy winning the championship courtesy of having won more races over the course of the season.

==Autumn Trophy==
After each FPA season, a mini-series known as the Autumn Trophy is held in early November.  Originally called the Winter Series, it involved two meetings of three races each, held at different UK circuits on consecutive weekends - often Brands Hatch and Snetterton.

The Autumn Trophy often features the Team USA Scholarship, a programme set up by [[ChampCar]] journalist and commentator [[Jeremy Shaw]] to allow promising young American drivers the chance to gain experience of European racing.  Originally designed to send American drivers to the [[Formula Ford Festival]], drivers such as [[Jimmy Vasser]], [[Philip Giebler]], [[AJ Allmendinger]] and [[JR Hildebrand]] have taken part in the Scholarship.

In 2007, a new feature was introduced to the Autumn Trophy - the FPA Shootout.  This was a separate competition within the second weekend of the Autumn Trophy at Snetterton where the driver that accumulated the most points from two out of the weekend's three races received automatic nomination for the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award.  In 2007, the FPA Shootout winner was Nick Tandy.

==Formula Palmer Audi on TV==
At present, Formula Palmer Audi is broadcast on [[Motors TV]], a pan-European subscription satellite station.  Highlights and interviews are shown as part of a 30-minute programme.  For the Championship, each programme covers one race, while the Autumn Trophy features two races to each programme.  Up until the end of the 2006 Championship, the programmes were presented by radio DJ and former Top Of The Pops presenter [[David Jensen]].  For the 2006 Autumn Trophy, the format was changed to a presenter-less magazine-type format as David's son [[Viktor Jensen]] had stopped racing in FPA.  All the races are commented on by legendary motorsport [[sportscaster|commentator]] [[David Addison]].
