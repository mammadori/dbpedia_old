The '''BMW 328''' is a [[sports car]] made by [[BMW]] between 1936 and 1940, designed by Kurt Joachimson. 
It featured many advanced features for its time, such as a tubular space frame and a [[hemi]]spherical combustion chamber engine.
It was much praised at the time for its performance and handling, proving to be suitable not only for the BMW factory drivers, but also perfect for everyday motoring.

===Engine===
The engine has hemispherical or cross flow combustion chambers. The intake valves are opened by the usual overhead valve push rod arrangement of a side cam, push rods, and rocker arms. The exhaust valves, on the other side of the [[cylinder head]], are opened by the same cam shaft, vertical push rods, rocker arms, horizontal push rods, and a second set of rocker arms.

==Awards==
In 1999 the BMW 328 was named one of 25 finalists for [[Car of the Century]] by a worldwide panel of automotive journalists.

==Motorsports==
It won the [[RAC Rally]] in 1939 and came in fifth overall (first in its class) in the 1939 [[Le Mans 24]] hours.

===Mille Miglia===
In 1938, BMW 328 became a class winner in [[Mille Miglia]].

In 1940, the Mille Miglia Touring Coupe won the Mille Miglia with average speed of {{convert|166.7|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

In 2004, the BMW 328 Mille Miglia Touring Coupe became the first car to win both the Mille Miglia (1940) and the modern-day classical version of the race.<ref>[http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147863833 Revealed:new BMW Mille Miglia!]</ref>

==Production==
After [[World War II|the Second World War]], the manufacturing plant in [[Eisenach]] where the 328 had been built found itself in the Russian occupation zone, and automobile manufacturing in Eisenach would follow a state directed path until [[German Reunification]] in 1989. 

==Influence on Bristol==
One of the Mille Miglia 328s (disguised as a [[Frazer Nash]]) and BMW's technical plans for the car were taken from the bombed BMW factory by English representatives from the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] and Frazer Nash companies. Fiedler, the BMW engineer, was persuaded to come too. [[Bristol Cars]] was set up to build complete cars, called Bristols, and would also supply engines to [[Frazer Nash]] for all their post-war cars. The first Bristol car, the [[Bristol 400|400]], was heavily based on the BMW plans.
This Bristol engine was also a common option in [[AC Cars|AC cars]], before the [[AC Cobra|Cobra]].
