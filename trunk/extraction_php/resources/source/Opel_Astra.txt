:''See also [[Vauxhall Astra]] and [[Holden Astra]] for the usage of the nameplate by other General Motors subsidiaries.''
The '''Opel Astra''' is a [[small family car]] designed and manufactured by [[Opel]], the European subsidiary of [[General Motors]].

It is branded as an Opel in [[continental Europe]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], [[India]] and [[Taiwan]], as '''Vauxhall Astra''' in the United Kingdom, as [[Holden]] in [[Australasia]], as '''Chevrolet Astra''' in [[Latin America]] and as a [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

The Astra is now built in [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Brazil]], [[South Africa]], [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]], as well as being assembled from [[complete knock down]] (CKD) kits in other countries.

== Naming convention ==

The Astra nameplate originates from [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] who had manufactured and marketed earlier generations of the [[Opel Kadett]] (the Kadett D ([[1979]]-[[1984]]) and Kadett E ([[1984]]-[[1991]])) as '''Vauxhall Astra'''.  Subsequent GM Europe policy standardised model nomenclature in the early 1990s whereby model names were the same in all markets regardless of whether the vehicle was being sold as an Opel or a Vauxhall.

As of 2009, there have been four generations of the vehicle (six if the two earlier Vauxhall badged generations of the Kadett are included). In a fashion typical for Opel models, they are designated with subsequent letters of the [[Latin alphabet]]. Opel's official convention is that the Astra is a logical continuation of the Kadett lineage, thus referring to the first generation of Opel Astra as the ''Astra F'' (the last Opel Kadett was the Kadett E). Another convention used by GM starts with ''Astra A'', adopting the notion that the Astra is a separate model. Models sold as Vauxhall, Holden or Chevrolet have different generation designations reflecting the history of those nameplates in their home markets and their naming conventions.

The Astra F debuted in 1991. With the Kadett E's successor, Opel adopted the Astra nameplate, which was already used by Vauxhall for the Kadett D and E (see [[Vauxhall Astra]]). It was offered as a three or five-door [[hatchback]], a [[sedan (car)|saloon]] (sedan), and an [[station wagon|estate]] (wagon), known as the Caravan. A [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] was also offered, designed and built by [[Bertone]] in [[Italy]]. This car was offered in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as [[Turkey]] for name Astra Classic for 1998 to 2002. The Astra F finished production in 2002.

The model was launched in [[South Africa]] in 1992, where it was produced under licence by [[Delta Motor Corporation|Delta]]. However, the Kadett name was retained for the Astra hatchback until 1999. The South African Astra included a variant with a 2.0&nbsp;L [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine called the 200tS which was produced in limited numbers in both sedan and hatchback guise. The engine (C20LET) in the 200tS was sourced from the Calibra 2.0 L turbo 4wd found on European markets, but local engineers converted the 6 speed drivetrain to front wheel drive only and as such was unique to that market. Sedan and station wagon models were offered under the Astra name. Controversially, the Kadett and Astra in South Africa won the title of 'Car of the Year' in two consecutive years (1993 and 1994) even though they were versions of the same car. South African nomenclature was denoted in centilitres, so the Astra and Kadett ranges featured 140, 160i, 180i and 200i models.

[[File:The Unisouth Wagon.JPG|thumb|left|An early Vauxhall Astra F]]
The Astra also became available in [[Australasia]] badged as a [[Holden]], first in [[New Zealand]] in 1995, and then [[Australia]] in 1996. The first models were imported from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but the current model is imported from [[Belgium]]. The original [[Holden Astra]] was originally a rebadged [[Nissan Pulsar]], first sold in the mid-1980s.

Opel Astra's first generation was imported to Brazil. Chevrolet of Brazil sent the 2.0 liter/115&nbsp;bhp engines to Belgium whence the completed cars took their way to Brazil. In 1996 the Brazilian government increased the import rate, though the car remained very expensive {{citation needed|date=March 2008}}. The second generation was manufactured in Brazil.

The Astra F consisted of two main revisions and was revised in 1995, with the launch of Opel's new Ecotec engine. For a short period, a submodel which consisted of parts from both revisions was produced. The submodel used all the new Ecotec running gear, but many parts from the previous revision were used in order to use up leftover parts. Other main changes included mildly-altered exterior styling, and availability of new specification models.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Aside from the South Africa-only 200TS, the lead model was the GSi — a 2.0&nbsp;L [[Straight-4|I4]] 16v petrol injected model with {{convert|147|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, available as a 3-door only. However, this was substituted between 1995 - 1996 and was renamed the ASTRA SPORT, although only a limited number were produced. It also featured sports bodykit and interior. The GSi too was updated in 1997, with the engine being replaced for a lower-powered but more modern 'Ecotec' version.

[[File:Vauxhall Astra Mk4 convertible 2.jpg|thumb|left|A Vauxhall Astra for the British Market]]
The Astra was launched in Europe in 1998, though sketches of the car can be seen as early as 1992. It was available as a 3 and 5-door [[hatchback]], 4-door saloon and two special versions: the Astra [[Coupé]] and the Astra [[Convertible|Cabrio]], both of them designed and built by [[Bertone]]. The Astra G/B saw the introduction of a [[natural gas]]-powered engine. Its chassis was tuned by Lotus and formed the base of a seven-seater [[compact MPV]], the [[Opel Zafira]].

The manufacturing of Astra G/B continued at Opel's [[Gliwice]] plant in [[Poland]] after the debut of the next-generation Astra H/C, with the older model being branded as '''Astra Classic''' in a similar fashion to its predecessor, catering to the lower end of the market. Apart from European markets, these models were sold in Australia and New Zealand as '''Holden Astra Classic''', until they were replaced by the [[Holden Viva]] in 2006.

The Astra G/B continues as the locally-built '''Chevrolet Astra''' in Brazil. It was facelifted in 2003, and is sold in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and other Latin American markets. In Brazil, the Astra G/B remains as the leader of its segment in sales since 1999.{{citation needed|date=April 2007}} The GM Brazilian 2.0 8v [[Straight-4|I4]] engine which equips the Astra has the "flexpower" technology, that allows the car to run on both petrol/alcohol fuels, providing 128/140&nbsp;hp (G/A) @ 5.200 rpm.

A taxi version of the Brazilian sourced model, powered with gasoline 2.0 engine was sold in [[Chile]] as the '''Chevy Urban'''.<ref>[http://www.lun.com/economia//detalle_noticia.asp?cuerpo=701&seccion=804&subseccion=901&idnoticia=C385069223124653 ]{{dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edicionesespeciales.elmercurio.com/hoy/detalle/index.asp?idnoticia=0110012006021X0060060&idcuerpo=485 |title=Ediciones Especiales - El Mercurio |publisher=Edicionesespeciales.elmercurio.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref>

In 2004, GM's Russian joint venture, [[GM-AvtoVAZ]], launched the '''Chevrolet Viva''', a four-door version of the Astra G/B. It was sold through Chevrolet dealers in Russia, while Opel dealers were (and are, as of July 2008) selling the newer Opel Astra H/C. Sales were poor from the start due to high pricing: the only version launched was equipped with 1.8L with above-average trim level, placing Viva price above [[Toyota Corolla]].<ref name=exp>[http://www.expert.ru/news/2008/03/18/gmavto/ Expert online, March 19, 2008]</ref> A project costing $340 million was selling less than a thousand cars annually<ref name=exp/> (801 car in 2007);<ref>[http://www.autoreview.ru/archive/2008/03/stat/ Autoreview, No. 3, 2008]</ref> rumours of shutting down Chevy Viva production circulated as early as summer of 2005.<ref>[http://www.newsru.com/arch/finance/29jul2005/avaz.html Newsru.com, July 29, 2005]</ref> GM-AvtoVAZ shut down small-scale production of Viva in March 2008.<ref name=exp/>

=== Astra V8 Coupe in DTM ===
The Astra G series Coupé look was used for the V8 powered dedicated race cars in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (DTM) series. These DTM cars are purpose built race cars with barely any parts taken form the road cars save for lights or door handles. The car's bodywork featured [[gull-wing door]]s that were each supported by two gas struts. The race cars were powered by 4.0L V8 engines with nearly {{Convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}. Opel did poorly during several season of DTM as only [[Manuel Reuter]] placed significantly in the championship once, taking second in the inaugural season 2000. Opel won the [[24h Nürburgring]] in 2003, though.

=== Astra XTreme ===
The Astra XTreme, a concept presented at the 2001 Geneva motor show, was a single-production [[V8]] powered Astra based on the G-series Astra DTM. Like the DTM race car, it featured a 4.0L V8 engine, producing {{Convert|444|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, [[gull-wing door]]s supported by gas struts, carbon fiber panels, and race-specification interior with five-point seatbelts.

[[Opel]] launched Astra H/C in March 2004. Based on the then-new [[GM Delta platform|Delta platform]],{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} its size was increased compared to the previous version. Each engine is provided with its own [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]]-tuned suspension settings.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The Astra H/C was first launched as a five-door hatchback, which by the end of 2004 was joined by a five-door Caravan [[Station wagon|estate]] and a sporty three-door hatchback, designated the GTC for European markets, Sport Hatch in the UK and the Coupé in Australia. The GTC has the option of a windscreen called "panoramic windscreen" (unique for a production car at the time of its launch) which extends into the roof area.

[[Image:Chevrolet Vectra Sedan - 2006 Montevideo Motor Show.jpg|thumb|left|The current Chevrolet Vectra sedan in Brazil is a twin of the Opel Astra C sedan]]

In 2005, GM Brazil replaced the aging Vectra B by developing a Astra H/C's sedan version on the full length GM Delta platform, that was named as [[Chevrolet Vectra]]. The model received also a facelift to match the others models offered in Brazil.

On 19 October 2006 at the international auto show in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], Opel launched this version of the sedan, to be manufactured in [[Gliwice]], [[Poland]] as an Opel for several Eurasian markets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wardsauto.com/ar/astra_output_poland/ |title= GM Launches Opel Astra Sedan Output in Poland|accessdate=2008-01-30 |last= Homola |first= Peter |date= 2007-08-23 |publisher= WardsAuto.com}}</ref> At that time, a 3-door van variant of the wagon was introduced by Vauxhall in Britain. 

In September 2007, GM Brazil lauched a version of 5-door Astra C hatchback, marketed as Chevrolet Vectra GT to differentiate from the already existing Astra G/B, which remains in production with a lower pricepoint.

The Astra sedan was launched in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as the Opel Astra Saloon in 2008, the only country in Western Europe where it was sold, and also the first [[right hand drive]] market for the model. <ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20080309/ai_n24426715 Motoring: OPEL ASTRA 4-DOOR FOR YOUR EYES ONLY] ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' March 9, 2008</ref>

GM Russia launched [[Complete knock down|SKD]] assembly of Astra on a temporary production site near [[Saint Petersburg]] in February 2008, with a potential capacity of 25,000 vehicles annually.<ref>[http://www.autoreview.ru/news/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=15956 Autoreview, March 2008]</ref>

A first for any major [[Europe]]an car is the availability of digital radio on some versions of the new Astra, while for the Astra product class first are electronic Continuous Damping Control (CDC) and AFL (Adaptive Forward Lighting). In 2005, the new Opel Astra [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel-Electric Hybrid]] appeared. By the end of 2005, estate and coupé versions were also launched. In 2008, sales of the Astra commenced in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], where it is sold as the Saturn Astra. 2008 was the last model year for the Chevrolet Astra in [[Mexico]] as a result of withdrawal of [[Opel]] products from the brand, replaced by the [[Chevrolet Cruze]] sedan for the 2010 model year.

The Saturn Astra debuted during the 2007 [[Chicago Auto Show]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061207/FREE/61207008/1063/PROMOBLOG01|title=Saturn's next Opel: 2008 Astra|work=[[AutoWeek]]|accessdate=December 7, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=119466|title=Inside Line: 2007 Chicago Auto Show: Saturn Takes the Wraps off Euro-Flavored 2008 Astra|work=Edmunds.com|accessdate=February 8, 2007}}</ref>

Due to a large number of unsold 2008 & 2009 models remaining on dealer lots, GM announced it would end production of the Saturn Astra<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=2009&make=Saturn&model=Astra&trimid=-1 |title=2009 Saturn Astra Specs and Features - MSN Autos |publisher=MSN Autos |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref>.  On June 5, 2009 GM announced it was selling the Saturn Corporation to [[Penske Automotive Group]]. Under the terms of the sale GM will continue to produce [[Saturn Aura]], [[Saturn Vue|Vue]], and [[Saturn Outlook|Outlook]] models for two years, expressly excluding the Astra. Production of the Saturn Astra effectively ended.  In addition, GM also withdrew Saturn sales from [[Canada]].

On September 30, 2009, [[Penske Automotive Group]] announced the deal to acquire Saturn from GM had fallen through, throwing into doubt the continued future of the Saturn brand.  GM is expected to close Saturn down sooner than the previously announced two-year plan. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33107120/ns/business-autos/|title=GM to shut down Saturn after Penske ends talks|work=MSNBC.com|accessdate=September 30, 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Martin Johnson Vauxhall Astra.jpg|thumb|right|[[Martin Johnson (racing driver)|Martin Johnson]]'s Astra that currently competes in the [[British Touring Car Championship]].]]
The Astra has been used in auto racing around the globe, in particular in [[touring car racing]]. Its highest success were achieved in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (see [[BTC-T Vauxhall Astra Coupe]]). The Astra Coupe soon became one fo the most successful cars in Touring Car history after taking both 1st and 2nd in the BTCC in 2001, 2002, 2003 & 2004 with it also managing to take the Teams and Manufacturers Championships at the same time. During its 4 years in the hands of the works [[VXRacing]] team it was almost invincible. after 2004, it was decided that Vauxhall would retire the Astra Coupe and move on to the Mark 5 Astra Sport Hatch for the next two years. The newer cars struggled to match the coupe's pace and were beaten by the Hondas and SEATs on many occasions. [[Yvan Muller]] was runner-up and [[Colin Turkington]] sixth in 2005. [[Fabrizio Giovanardi]] finished fifth, [[Gavin Smith (racing driver)|Gavin Smith]] seventh and [[Tom Chilton]] eight the next season. For 2007, [[VX Racing]] dropped the Astra in favour of the Vectra C. Due to the reliability and speed fo the cars, they were used by many independent teams such as GA Motorsport, Collards Motorsport, Thurlby Motors and Arkas Racing for the next few years with one car entered this year by Martin Johnson.

In 2002, 2003 and 2006, three different drivers were [[FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers|European Rallycross Champions]] in the Division 2 driving Astras. The 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 runner-ups also raced in that car. [[Christian Ledesma]] was 2004 TC 2000 champion with an Astra and [[Matías Rossi]] took that title in 2006 and 2007.

The Astra has been used in the shape of [[silhouette racing car]]s as well. It was featured in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] from 2000 to 2003 ([[Manuel Reuter]] was runner-up in 2000) and the [[Stock Car Brasil]] from 2004 to 2008 (Giuliano Losacco won the tournament in 2004 and 2005). In 2009, the Astra B body was replaced Stock Car Brasil by a [[Chevrolet Vectra|Vectra]], which is in fact the same as the European Astra C.
