The '''Volkswagen Polo''' is a [[supermini car]] manufactured by [[Volkswagen]].  It is sold in [[Europe]] and other markets worldwide in [[hatchback]], [[sedan (car)|saloon]], [[coupé]] and [[station wagon|estate]] variants.

==History==
[[Image:Vw derby 2 v sst.jpg|thumb|Volkswagen Derby]]

As of 2009, there have been five separate generations of the Polo, usually identified by a "Series" or "Mark" number.<ref name="media.vw.com">{{Cite web
| title = VW: POLO HISTORY
| accessdate = 2008-10-16
| url = http://media.vw.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=9381
}}</ref> 

Some generations were [[facelift (automobile)|facelifted]] mid way through production, with the updated versions known unofficially by an addition of the letter F to the mark number, e.g. Mark  IIF.  Some press and enthusiasts consider the facelifts to be separate models and hence have used the unofficial designations Polo Mark 1 to Mark 7 for previous generations.<ref name="poloshow">{{Cite web
| title = VW Polo History
| accessdate = 2008-10-16
| url = http://www.vwpoloshow.co.uk/historyframes2.htm
}}</ref> Each model of Polo is also identified by a two- or three-character Volkswagen Group ''Typ'' number. Official VW Polo history describes Mark I to Mark IV using either [[Roman numerals]]<ref name="media.vw.com"/> or [[Arabic numerals]], with facelifted variants known as "Phase II" models.<ref name="used-polo-uk">[http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/used/search Volkswagen UK: Used car locator]</ref>

The [[car body styles|body style]] has been varied through the life of the car, originally as a hatchback which derived from the [[Audi 50]].<ref name="poloshow"/>  A [[sedan (car)|saloon]] version was marketed as the [[Volkswagen Derby]].

Volkswagen vehicles built off different platforms have carried the Polo [[nameplate|name plate]].  For example the '''Volkswagen Polo Playa''' hatchback sold in [[Southern Africa]] in the late 1990s was a rebadged [[SEAT Ibiza]] which has a different body shell from the Mark III Polo sold in Europe at the same time.  The current saloon is only available in [[China]], [[Latin America]] and [[South Africa]] and other Southern Africa countries.

===Position in the Volkswagen range===
On its introduction in 1975, the Polo was Volkswagen's second front wheel drive hatchback model, fitting into the range beneath the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], which had been launched the previous year.  It remained the smallest model in the Volkswagen range until 1998, when the [[Volkswagen Lupo]] was introduced.  The Polo is still Volkswagen's second smallest model, larger than the [[Volkswagen Fox|Fox]] and smaller than the Golf.  (In North America, the Golf is the smallest Volkswagen available, the Polo never having been sold in this territory.)

Over the generations, as with many other long-lived car brands, the Polo's size has increased, and the latest incarnation of the Polo is actually larger than the original Golf Mark I.

The fifth generation Polo is mechanically very similar to the [[SEAT Ibiza]] Mk4 and the upcoming [[Audi A1]], being based on a standard [[Volkswagen Group]] platform used for several models.

===Performance versions and motorsport===
Volkswagen pioneered the so-called [[hot hatch]] genre of high performance hatchbacks with the [[Volkswagen Golf GTI|Golf GTI]] in 1975, and has produced a number of performance versions of the Polo. The first of these was the Polo ''GT'' version of the Mark 1F.

The Mark II and IIF were available as [[supercharger|supercharged]] [[Volkswagen Polo G40|G40]] models.  The GT [[Volkswagen Polo G40|G40]] with its 1.3-litre 85&nbsp;kW (115&nbsp;bhp) could reach 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) in 8.1&nbsp;s from standstill and had a maximum speed of 196&nbsp;km/h (122&nbsp;mph).  It was used by Volkswagen to set a number of world endurance speed records, such as the 1.3-litre class records for speed over 24 hours and speed over a distance of 5000&nbsp;km.

The fastest version of the [[Volkswagen Polo Mk3|Mark III]] on the UK market was the 16-valve h {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} model. A 120&nbsp;PS (88&nbsp;kW) [[Volkswagen Polo GTI|Polo GTI]] model was also produced, but only in a limited edition in Germany, and this was the first time the GTI label had been used for a Polo.  A GTI version of the Mark IIIF Polo, with a 125&nbsp;bhp (92&nbsp;kW) 1.6-litre petrol engine was also produced.

In 2004 ''Volkswagen Individual'', a specialist division of Volkswagen, produced a limited number of ([[Volkswagen Polo Mk4|Mark IV Polo]]) Club Sports with a 1.8T 180&nbsp;hp/132&nbsp;kW engine.  Available only in Germany, this was based on the one-make racing series ''Polo Cup Racer'' hatchback.  The Club Sport came with a roll cage inside the vehicle and [[Recaro]] racing seats as standard.
 
A GTI version of the Polo Mark IVF was launched in 2006.  This features styling similar to that of the contemporary Golf GTI and a [[turbocharged]] 20-valve 150&nbsp;bhp 1.8-litre petrol engine.  It has a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 8.2&nbsp;s and a top speed of {{convert|134|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

Volkswagen Individual have also engineered an even faster Polo called the ''Polo GTI Cup Edition''.  Available with the same 1.8T engine, albeit with 180&nbsp;bhp (130&nbsp;kW), its claimed 0–100&nbsp;km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph) is 7.5&nbsp;s and it has a claimed top speed of {{convert|225|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

''Volkswagen Racing'' in [[South Africa]] [[rallying|rallied]] a [[four-wheel drive]] Mark IVF Polo which shared some components with its sister [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC) [[Škoda Fabia]]; the S2000 has a 2.0&nbsp;L 191&nbsp;kW (260&nbsp;bhp) engine.

Mark IV Polos have been entered into the [[Junior World Rally Championship]] (JWRC).

There have been a number of one make race series for the Polo, starting with the [[Volkswagen Polo G40 Cup]] for Mark II and Mark IIF G40 versions.  The current Polo Cup championship for {{convert|105|bhp|abbr=on}} cars is a support race at rounds of the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]].

==Related models==
The first Polo was effectively a [[rebadged]] version of the [[Audi 50]] hatchback launched in August 1974.<ref name="poloshow"/>
The Audi 50 was discontinued in 1978 as Audi concentrated on larger luxury models.  The Mark I and Mark II versions of the Polo were then standalone models in the Volkswagen range.

With the expansion of the [[Volkswagen Group]], [[Audi]] (in the 1960s), [[SEAT]] (in the 1980s) and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] (in the 1990s) were acquired, and the [[Automobile platform|platform]] used for the Polo was shared with other models.

The Mark III Polo shared its platform with the [[SEAT Ibiza]] Mark II.  The Ibiza was actually launched before the Polo, and shared essentially all its mechanicals, the dashboard and other interior components, although there were no body panels shared between the two cars.  The saloon and estate versions of the Mark III Polo were actually re-badged [[SEAT Córdoba]] models, and had no body panels in common with the Polo hatchback.  The [[SEAT Inca]] and [[Volkswagen Caddy]] vans were also based on this model.  The [[Volkswagen Lupo]] and [[SEAT Arosa]] were also based on a shortened version of the Mark III Polo platform.

The Mark IV Polo continued this trend of platform sharing, with the [[SEAT Ibiza]] Mark III and [[Škoda Fabia]] Marks I & II both being developed on the same platform and featuring several of the same engines.

The 2009 Mark V Polo is developed on the newest platform PQ25, the same platform used in the [[SEAT Ibiza]] Mark IV that was launched in 2008 and the upcoming [[Audi A1]].

==Bodystyles==
[[Image:Polo 2 a h sst.jpg|thumb|Mark II Polo "Wagon" shape]]
The first Polos were [[hatchback]]s, with the [[sedan (car)|saloon]] being marketed as the [[Volkswagen Derby]].

On the arrival of the Mark II model, the saloon was renamed the '''Volkswagen Polo Classic''' and the hatchback style was renamed as a [[coupé]], the '''Volkswagen Polo Coupé'''.  Unusually, the Polo that was marketed as a hatchback was closer in concept to an estate.  This version was the most popular in virtually every country where the Polo was sold.

From the Mark III onwards, the range was more straightforwardly conventional, including unambiguous saloon, hatchback and estate models.

====Body style summary====
*3-door [[hatchback]] (all versions) - the Mark II and Mark IIF were available in two separate 3-door hatchback styles, one of which was badged as a coupé
*2-door saloon (Mark I, Mark IF, Mark II, Mark IIF)
*4-door saloon (Mark III, Mark IIIF)
*5-door hatchback (Mark III, Mark IIIF, Mark IV, Mark IVF)
*5-door estate (Mark III, Mark IIIF)
*5-door [[crossover SUV]]-style ([[two wheel drive|2WD]]) hatchback (Mark IV, Mark IVF)

==Mechanical layout==
The Polo is a compact car, with a traditional [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]] engine and [[front-wheel drive]].  Mark I Polos only came with four-cylinder [[petrol]] engines, but for the Mark II, a [[diesel engine]] was offered for the first time, although only in certain markets, others having to wait until the launch of the Mark III.  The current range includes a variety of three- and four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines.

Early versions used four speed [[manual transmission]], whilst the current car is available with either five-speed manual or four-speed [[automatic transmission]].  The suspension system on all models uses a fully independent [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension, and a [[Twist-beam rear suspension]].  Most models use [[disc brakes]] at the front and rear [[drum brakes]], although some recent models have all round disc brakes.

The differences between the Audi and Volkswagen models were minor, with the Polo being cheaper and much more basic.  The two cars were initially sold alongside each other, but the Audi 50 never sold as well, and was withdrawn in 1978.  The Polo was manufactured at the Volkswagen plant in [[Wolfsburg]].

In 1977, the Derby saloon was released, which was simply a Polo, identical to the hatchback from the [[C-pillar]] forward, with a large boot attached (an [[Audi]] proposal which was never sold by them){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

The Mark I Polo was available with the following engines:
*895 cc, straight-4 petrol (hatchback only)
*1093&nbsp;cc straight-4 petrol, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW)
*1272 cc, straight-4 petrol, (Polo GT, Derby sedan models, [[Audi 50]] only)
Different levels of compression were used on each size to achieve different power outputs, and the variations are numerous, often differing depending on the country of sale, ranging from 35 to 60&nbsp;PS (26 to 44&nbsp;kW).

The Mark I Polo and Derby were facelifted in 1979. Sometimes referred to as the Mark IF, the facelifted model featured plastic bumpers, a different front grille and a revised dashboard. The round headlights of the Derby were replaced with square ones, bringing it into line with the similar (but larger) Golf-based [[VW Jetta|Jetta]] saloon.

The Polo Mark II (or ''Typ 86C'') was introduced in October 1981,<ref name="media.vw.com"/><ref>{{Cite web
| title = Polo Mark II
| accessdate = 2008-10-16

}}</ref> with the major change being the introduction of a third body style with a steep (almost vertical) rear window, in addition to a version resembling the original Mark I shape with a diagonal rear window.  These two body styles were called the ''Wagon'' (in some markets) and ''Coupé'' respectively, although in fact both were three-door hatchbacks, and in some markets the Wagon designation was not used, with that car being simply the "Volkswagen Polo" without a suffix.  The sedan version was now called the '''Polo Classic''', and the Derby name became extinct.  Production was expanded to [[Spain]] in the mid-1980s following Volkswagen's takeover of [[SEAT]]. By 1983, the millionth Polo was produced. The second million were produced by 1986.<ref name="media.vw.com"/>.

Although it was still marketed as a supermini to compete with the likes of the [[Austin Metro]], [[Ford Fiesta]] and [[Renault 5]], the Polo was larger than most – if not all – of its competitors, and was almost as large as small family cars like the [[Ford Escort]] and [[Vauxhall Astra|Vauxhall Astra/Opel Kadett]].  Its price, comfort and specification were also more comparable with these larger cars.

The Mark II Polo was used extensively by Volkswagen to develop future innovations, for example [[supercharging]] with a 40 [[Millimetre|mm]] [[G-Lader|G-Lader supercharger]] in the GT [[Volkswagen Polo G40|G40]] version.  A 60&nbsp;mm G-Lader would later be used on the larger and more technically challenging [[G60]] engine used in the Golf and [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]].

A fuel efficient two-cylinder diesel was prototyped in the mid 1980s with a [[G-Lader#Sizes_and_car_models|G40 supercharger]] to overcome its small capacity, although this did not make it to production.  A high fuel efficiency model which did make production was the ''Formel E'' (E for Economy), introduced in 1983.  This used a high compression 1272&nbsp;cc engine, taller gear ratios and an early stop-start ignition system (called "SSA") which would cut the engine when idle for more than two seconds to save fuel whilst temporarily stopped in traffic, and re-start the engine on moving the gear lever to the left in neutral.  Similar systems were later used on the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3]] and various systems from other car manufacturers.

It was a popular import in the UK, competing with the likes of the [[Peugeot 205]], [[Fiat Uno]] and [[Nissan Micra]].  Its reliability and build quality were among the best to be found on a small car of this era.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The Mark II was available with the following engines:
*1093&nbsp;cc straight-4 petrol (1981–1983)
*1272&nbsp;cc straight-4 petrol (1981–)
*1043&nbsp;cc straight-4 petrol (1983–)
*1272&nbsp;cc straight-4 petrol with [[fuel injection]] and equipped with a [[catalytic converter]]. (1983–) GT 
*1272&nbsp;cc straight-4 [[supercharger|supercharged]] petrol with 113&nbsp;PS (83&nbsp;kW) ('' [[Volkswagen Polo G40|G40]]'' version 1987 only)
*1.3&nbsp;L straight-4 diesel (1986–)

|production = 1990–1994
}}
The Mark II Facelift(referred as the Mark IIF, also unofficially known as the "Mark 3") saw square headlights, enlarged and reshaped tail-lights, bigger bumpers and a new interior ([[dashboard]] and door trim)<ref>http://www.vwpoloshow.co.uk/history/mk2f.htm</ref>.  The three different body styles were maintained.  As well as the cosmetic differences, under the skin the car received modifications to the chassis, suspension and brakes.  The new Polo still had the 4-cylinder engine but now as well as the carburettor 1.0&nbsp;L, a fuel injection model was available with single-point injection and all engines came standard with a catalytic converter to combat tightening European laws on car emissions.  The saloon was only produced in Spain, and production of it ceased in 1992.

A clever feature on this version of the Polo was a stereo/cassette player unit which could be completely removed.  This feature caught on well with buyers, who were able to remove it from the car as a security measure.

At the time of launch of the Mark IIF Polo, the highest performance model was the Polo GT.  This featured a multi-point fuel injected version of the 1272&nbsp;cc engine.  This produced {{convert|75|bhp|abbr=on}} and had a quoted top speed of {{convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. 0-60 figures from stand still stood at 11.1 seconds.  Defining features of the GT include red piping in the bumpers, black overhead cloth, a rev counter and a red "GT" badge in the grille.  This was succeeded by the launch of the [[Volkswagen Polo G40|G40]] in May 1991, displacing the GT as the most powerful Polo at the time.  The GT squareback was discontinued in 1992 due to poor sales in comparison with the coupé version.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Soon after the launch of the Mark IIF, another sporting model was added to the range &mdash; a new version of the [[supercharger|supercharged]] [[Volkswagen Polo G40|G40]], now as a full production model in all markets rather than the limited batch of Mark II G40s.  As with the previous model, [[Volkswagen Motorsport]] modified G40 Cup cars were sold for racing in a one-make series, the ''Volkswagen Polo G40 Cup''.  Features that define the [[Volkswagen Polo G40|G40]] from other Polo models at the time (on top of the GT) include a bee-sting aerial, BBS cross-spoke alloy wheels, Le Mans interior trim and front and rear red "G40" badges.

}}</ref> and was a completely new model (on a new chassis), available as 3- and 5-door hatchback versions.  It shared its platform with the [[SEAT Ibiza#Second generation (6K, 1993-2002)|SEAT Ibiza Mark 2]].  This platform actually used the floorpan of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3]] (a multitude of mechanical parts and all of the suspension components were interchangeable among the three models).  Although the dashboard and a number of mechanical components, including engines, were shared with the Ibiza, outwardly the two cars were different, with no shared body panels.

The saloon and estate versions of the Mark III were essentially rebadged [[SEAT Córdoba]]s, which were launched a year earlier.  They were referred to internally by Volkswagen as the ''Typ 6KV'', and shared body panels with the SEAT model rather than the Polo hatchback models, with some cosmetic alterations such as new rear and front bumpers and headlights.  The [[Volkswagen Caddy#Caddy Type 9K|Volkswagen Caddy 9K]] van also shares the same platform and front-end styling as the 6KV models.

The Volkswagen Lupo and [[SEAT Arosa]] [[city car]]s were based on a shortened version of the Typ 6N platform, and shared many components.

The car was available with the following engines:
*1043 cc straight-4 petrol {{convert|45|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} (1995–97)
*1272 cc straight-4 petrol {{convert|55|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} (1995–96)

Although the car was similar in appearance to the Mark III, Volkswagen claimed that 70% of the components were new.  The bodyshell was fully galvanised and stiffened but not fully redesigned, although some panels were changed.  Power steering, [[anti-lock brakes]] and twin airbags were made standard.  The saloon and estate versions received the new interior, but not the full exterior facelift.  Also, the 3-cylinder 1.4&nbsp;TDI engine was introduced for the 3 and 5-door hatchbacks as well as a 1.6 16v [[Volkswagen Polo GTI|GTI]] version. The Mark IIIF '''Polo Classic''' is still sold in [[Mexico]] and [[Argentina]]. In Mexico is known as the '''Derby'''.

Both versions of the Mark III Polo were strong sellers in the UK, never quite a match for market leaders such as the [[Ford Fiesta]] and [[Vauxhall Corsa]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, but a strong competitor for the likes of the [[Fiat Punto]] and [[Nissan Micra]].  At the time of its launch, it was arguably the best small car on sale in Britain in terms of build quality and "upmarket" feel, something that was noticeably absent from the likes of the Citroen Saxo and [[Peugeot 106]].  By the time of the Mark III's demise however, many of its competitors had matched and even exceeded its standards{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.  The 1.4 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] was considered the best in the range due to its reliability, fuel consumption, and relative power, for a small engine.

The '''Volkswagen Polo Playa''' was a model for the [[South Africa]]n market.  It was sold instead of the European Polo Mark III from 1996 until 2002, and was effectively a rebadged [[SEAT Ibiza]] Mark II.  In 2002, the Mark IV Polo was adopted in South Africa, and the separate Polo Playa model was dropped.

Unveiled in September 2001, the all-new Mark IV (or ''Typ 9N'', sometimes also referred to as the "Mark 6") model was put on sale in early 2002.<ref name="media.vw.com"/>  It shares its platform with the [[SEAT Ibiza]] Mk3 , [[Škoda Fabia]] Mk1 and [[Škoda Fabia]] Mk2 .  The car is all new compared to the Mark III/F, and bears more structural resemblance to the Typ 6KV than the Typ 6N; outwardly the most recognisable change is the use of quad round headlights similar to the Lupo's.

Volkswagen Racing rallyed a Polo S1600 in the 2003 Junior [[World Rally Championships]], winning the [[Rally of Turkey|Turkish]] round.  The Super 1600 developed 165&nbsp;kW/215 to its front wheels.

This version of the Polo was a mixed success in the UK.  It sold reasonably well (though not as well as some earlier Polos) but several customer satisfaction surveys by high profile motoring magazines such as [[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] gave the Polo a very low rating.  Top Gear's 2005 survey rated the Polo as the third least satisfying supermini to own, with only the [[Fiat Punto]] and [[Rover 25]] receiving a worse rating.  It fell behind most of its crucial rivals, namely the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Vauxhall Corsa]], [[Renault Clio]] and [[Peugeot 206]].

There was also a [[crossover SUV]] version of the Polo, similar to the [[Rover Streetwise]], with "off-road" styling, named '''Polo Fun''' ('''Polo Dune''' in the [[UK]]), but despite its appearance the car was never available with [[4motion]] [[four-wheel drive]].  A saloon version, called Polo Classic, was produced in [[Brazil]], [[South Africa]] and [[China]], and exported to the rest of [[Latin America]] and to [[Australia]].

The Polo Classic for the [[Australia]]n market is sourced from China, making it the first Chinese built car to be exported to a [[right hand drive]] country.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,12336955-13232,00.html Volkswagen Polo Classic sedan] ''[[The Australian]]'', 23 February 2005</ref>{{-}}

In 2005, the Mark IV was face-lifted with new [[Volkswagen Passat]]-style one piece headlights and tail lights, and a different hatch. This facelifted model is officially known as the Mark IV Phase II<ref name="used-polo-uk"/> or ''Typ 9N3'', and sometime referred to as the Mark IVF or "Mark 7".  Designed by [[Walter de'Silva]], in the UK, the Mark IVF is available in seven different trim levels, ranging from the basic Polo E model to the [[Volkswagen Polo GTI|Polo GTI]].  The engine range is as for the Mark IV, with the addition of the following engines:

}}

A mini SUV-styled (but still two wheel drive) '''CrossPolo''' version of the Mark IVF was also produced as a successor to the Polo Fun.  In 2007, Volkswagen premiered its [[BlueMotion]] range with the emphasis of lower emissions and high fuel economy.  Volkswagen's first car under the BlueMotion range is a modified 1.4 litre VW Polo TDI with longer gear ratios, aerodynamic changes and lightweight alloys with low rolling resistant tyres.  The end result is a car capable of producing less than 100g/km of CO2 with a stated fuel economy of 74.3mpg on a combined cycle.  Volkswagen plan to use the platform set by the Polo on expanding their BlueMotion ranges which includes the [[Volkswagen Golf]] and the [[Volkswagen Passat]].

Volkswagen launched the fifth generation Polo (internal designation ''Typ 6R'') at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in March 2009.

It shares its platform with the 2008 [[SEAT Ibiza]] Mk4 and the upcoming [[Audi A1]]. Production for the UK market is scheduled to start in summer 2009, with first deliveries in October 2009.<ref name="vwuk-polo5">{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/volkswagen-world/news/item/131|title=Volkswagen News: Smarter, lighter and even cleaner: fifth generation Polo unveiled|date=2009-03|work=www.volkswagen.co.uk|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref>

The Polo Mark V is 36&nbsp;mm longer and 32&nbsp;mm wider and sits 13&nbsp;mm lower to the road than the previous generation Polo. Boot capacity is increased by 10 litres to 280 litres of storage space with 952 litres with the seats folded down. The car is 7.5% lighter than its predecessor. The Polo has thorax airbags and has been awarded a five-star [[EuroNCAP]] crash impact rating.<ref>{{Cite web

GTI and [[BlueMotion]] versions of the Polo are speculated to go into production in 2010. The next generation Polo may also become available in North America as soon as 2010, as Volkswagen was looking to add a subcompact vehicle to its lineup there. It is confirmed that the Polo will be sold in North America, but it is uncertain whether it will be the current generation version or its successor.<ref>{{Cite web

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=July 2009}}
*The Polo name has been a source of speculation.  Some people believed it was a reference to polar winds, in keeping with Volkswagen's penchant for naming its watercooled cars after winds and currents, but many fans insist that it is in fact a pun on the Golf's name, because "golf" and "polo" are both words (in both English and German) for upper-class sports.  The fact that the Polo's original saloon derivative was named the Derby gives more credence to the latter theory, since derby, like polo, refers to an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport.

*It should be noted that in 1989-1991 the small displacement Polo engine (1043cc) and trans-axle were used in an attempt to revive the [[Trabant|East German Trabant]] replacing the 600cc 2 cylinder two-stroke and awkward column shift transmission.  Both two-stroke and Polo versions were produced side by side but Trabant production soon fell after the collapse of the Berlin wall, November 9, 1989, because people could now own other cars.  Many new Trabants were unsold and sent back to the factory in Zwickau.  Trabant production ended in 1991.

*Some Polo models from the 1970s and 1980s used the emblem of the city of [[Wolfsburg]] on the steering wheel hub rather than the normal Volkswagen logo seen today.  This was typical of older Volkswagens, such as the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]].

*In 2004, a [[viral video]] advertisement was widely circulated on the internet.  In it, a [[suicide bomber]] drives a Polo to his target; the bomb is detonated but the car remains completely intact, to the extent that the event goes unnoticed by bystanders.  The ad finally displays the Polo's established [[tagline]], ''Small but tough''.  The ad was created by the secretive, London based, freelance advertising partnership, ''Lee and Dan'', who claimed it was not intended to be viewed by the public.  Despite legal action against the partnership by Volkswagen in 2005,<ref>Stephen Brook, {{cite web | title=VW to sue Polo bomb ad duo | work=The Guardian, 26 January 2005| url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1398826,00.html | accessdate=June 28, 2006 }}</ref> there are rumours the ad was secretly commissioned by the company as a form of [[Viral marketing]].
