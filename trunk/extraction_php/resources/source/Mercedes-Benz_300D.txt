The first '''[[Mercedes-Benz]] 300D''' [[automobile]] (not to be confused with the [[Mercedes-Benz_Type_300#W189|300d]]) was introduced in 1975 ([[United States|U.S.]]) and started its life by placing the newly developed 3.0 litre five-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[naturally aspirated]] [[diesel engine]] 617.910 in a [[Mercedes-Benz W115|W115 chassis]] four-cylinder [[Mercedes-Benz 240D]] diesel. For the American market those cars only came with [[power window]]s and [[automatic transmission]].

The W123 chassis of the Mercedes-Benz 300D was introduced as a [[1976]] model ([[1977]] U.S.). Its 3.0 litre five-cylinder [[diesel engine]] with [[indirect injection]] (using a Bosch MW for the American market, or W for the rest of the world) piston-type mechanical fuel injection pump, produced 80 to 88 [[horsepower|hp]] (59 to 65&nbsp;kW), depending on the year or country. This model features an extra 600&nbsp;cmÂ³ [[Engine displacement|displacement]] compared to the four-cylinder Mercedes-Benz 240D diesel.  The W123 chassis evolution continued with the addition of the 300D Turbo Diesel in 1982 (1981 for station wagon), sporting a 3.0 litre five-cylinder [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] turbocharged engine which was originally developed in 1978 and first offered in the US market for 300SD models in 1979. This engine developed 118 to 123&nbsp;hp (88 to 91&nbsp;kW) and considerably improved the car's performance while still maintaining the superb reliability and efficiency of earlier models. In addition to the sedan (300D) a station wagon (300TD) and coupe (300CD) were also produced. The 300TD also had optional rearward facing third row seat which could fold flat into the floor, which was also seen on [[Volvo]], [[Saab 95]] and [[Ford Taurus]] station wagons.

Production of the [[Mercedes-Benz W123|W123 chassis]] ended in [[1985]] but in many countries as many as 75% of the cars originally registered remain on the road today 20 years later, a testament to the quality and durability of the original design. The 300D badge continued on in the [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124 chassis]] family until [[1993]], but as a completely different design.

The [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124 chassis]] 300D (pre [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|E Class]] facelift) has the [[Mercedes-Benz OM603|OM603]] engine, which is a 3.0 litre six-cylinder turbocharged engine that appeared for one year only, 1987.  The Turbo Diesel W124 appeared anew in 1990 until 1993, as the 300D 2.5 Turbo, with the [[OM602]] engine.  The latter engine was a 2.5 litre five cylinder turbocharged engine.
