The '''Porsche 953''' was a heavily modified variant of the [[Porsche 911|911]], designed and built specifically to compete in the 1984 [[Paris-Dakar Rally]]. It was a short lived model, replaced in 1985 by the [[Porsche 959|959]]. It is sometimes referred to as the 911 4x4, as it used the developmental, manually controlled [[four-wheel drive]] system that was intended to be used on the 959. Travelling on an extremely enhanced suspension, powered by a {{convert|300|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}, 6 cylinder engine, and weighing in at {{convert|2750|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, it was extremely successful. Three of them finishing Paris-Dakar, one taking overall first place.
