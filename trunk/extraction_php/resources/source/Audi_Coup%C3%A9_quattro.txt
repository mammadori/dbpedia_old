The '''Audi Coupé quattro''' (''Typ'' 85) was introduced in very late 1984, and was based on the updated [[Audi Coupé GT]], introduced in the Autumn of 1984.
__TOC__

The updated GT was given a new sloped radiator grille and [[headlamp|headlights]], large wrap-around [[bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] with integrated spotlights and turn signals, plastic sill covers, and the large rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] from the [[Audi Quattro]].  These changes brought the [[drag coefficient]] down to 0.36.  The [[internal combustion engine|engine]] given to the Coupé quattro (CQ) was the {{convert|2226|cc|abbr=on|lk=on}} {{convert|136|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} KV series.  A new [[dashboard]] was introduced, along with a new interior.

Both the GT and CQ models would appear to be almost identical from the outside except for a few minor "quattro" specific.  The GT had "COUPE GT" on the rear side windows, the CQ had the "quattro" decal from the Ur-Quattro.  Similarly at the rear, the badging was "GT" and "quattro" respectively.  The CQ also had twin [[exhaust system|exhaust]] tips, the Ur-Quattro rear windscreen with "quattro" written into the heater elements (very obviously so on a cold and frosty morning).  The front grille was also adorned with the "quattro" badge from the Ur.  Inside the cabin was identical, except the [[center console (automobile)|centre console]] received the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] lock switch, and [[light-emitting diode|LED]] [[bar chart|bargraph]] displays in place of the GT's three analogue-style gauges.

Mechanically, the CQ took components from the GT and the previous [[Audi 80]] quattro.  The [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] [[powertrain|drivetrain]] was similar, almost identical to that used on the Ur-Quattro - the main differences being the use of the GT front struts, smaller diameter front [[disc brake|brake disks]] at {{convert|256|mm|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}, and lower [[gear ratio|ratios]] in the gearbox and rear differential.  The [[shock absorber|damper]] and [[spring (device)|spring]] rates were also different from the Ur.

The CQ was mechanically identical to the Audi 90 quattro, and shared many components with the 80 quattro.  There was also a high degree of commonality with the [[North America]]n Audi 4000 quattro.  [[wheel|Roadwheels]] were 6.0Jx14", with steel or [[aluminium alloy]] rims being standard, dependent on the market.  7.0Jx15" Ronals, almost identical to the Ur wheel were also available.  The CQ/90Q/4000Q also received their own exhaust manifold and downpipe (5-3-1, the GT's was 5-2-1).

Production ran from late 1984 to 1988, and was in the total region of 8000 cars.
