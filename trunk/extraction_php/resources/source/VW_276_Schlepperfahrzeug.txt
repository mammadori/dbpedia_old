The '''Volkswagen Type 276 Schlepperfahrzeug''' was a derivative of the [[Volkswagen K端belwagen|K端belwagen Type 82]] which was modified to enable it to tow a load, gun or a trailer, that would be deployed in a unit which comprised two modified K端belwagen, a small caliber [[anti-tank gun]] (37 PaK), an [[Limbers and caissons (military)|ammunition trailer]] laden with 16 cases of three rounds of [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|A. P. shell]] , and seven men (drivers included). The Typ 276 only saw light at the end of 1944 and never went into mass production. It is thus not surprising that collectors have remained largely unaware of its existence. 

==Differences==
The Typ 276 differed from the standard Typ 82 on the following points: 

===Suspension and tyres===
On the first model, the rear suspension was beefed-up, and the car shod with bigger tyres (BF 200C16) on 7.00C16 rims (with a smaller offset inwards: 13&nbsp;mm. instead of 33&nbsp;mm).  These were the same tyres and rims fitted on the [[Volkswagen Schwimmwagen|VW 166 'Schwimmwagen']].

===Gearing===
To improve traction which proved to be grossly inadequate when towing off-road, these Typ 276 were later fitted with different gears in the rear axle reduction boxes (14:29 = 1:2.07 instead of 15:21 = 1:1.4); this increased the ground clearance by 15&nbsp;mm. (19/32") at the rear, brought the top speed down from 80 Kmh. (50 Mph) to 54 Kmh.(34 Mph) at an engine speed of 3300 rpm., and lowered the mileage to 37 mpg. on the road. 

===Governor===
To prevent over-revving, especially when driving without a trailer, the engine was fitted with a governor on the generator shaft (as fitted on the Type 155 static engine). 

===Drawbar pull===
With these modifications, the drawbar pull reached, on tarmac, 700&nbsp;kg. (1550 Lbs.) when starting from a stand, and 500&nbsp;kg. (1100 Lbs.) at a speed of 8 Kmh.(5 Mph) and the Typ 276 would (happily ?) pull a load of about 550 to 565&nbsp;kg (1210 to 1250 Lbs.) at top speed.
