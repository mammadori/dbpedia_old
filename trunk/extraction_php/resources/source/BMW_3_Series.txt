The '''BMW 3 Series''' is a [[compact executive car]] manufactured by the German automaker [[BMW]] since May 1975. Successor to the [[BMW New Class]], it has been produced in five different generations and in no less than five different [[car body style|body style]]s. It is BMW's best selling automobile, accounting for nearly 40% of the company's auto sales in 2005.

==Social and marketing significance==
BMW released its [[BMW E21|E21]] in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]], attracting customers seeking both prestige and economy, nearly doubling BMW's worldwide auto sales figures in three years, and winning numerous automotive world awards and honors.

Three decades later, the 3 Series is still the best-selling of its class,<ref name="bmwgroup.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwgroup.com/e/nav/index.html?http://www.bmwgroup.com/e/0_0_www_bmwgroup_com/investor_relations/finanzberichte/geschaeftsberichte/2005/zahlen/marke_bmw.shtml|title=Investor Relations/Annual Report 2005|accessdate=2007-07-27|work=bmwgroup.com}}</ref> as commonplace in Asia, America and Australia as in Europe, and it has even outsold some cheaper models, like Ford Mondeo in the UK.

While some argue that the popularity of the car had reduced its prestigious image, the 3 Series still remains the benchmark and its competitors are often judged on how close they come to this car.

The 3 series has also maintained [[BMW in motorsport|BMW's racing heritage]]. The [[BMW M|M]] version of the 3 series, [[BMW M3|M3]], debuted in 1988.<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=66153 BMW 3 Series<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The 3 series cars usually sell well, but two-door versions usually do not sell as well as sedan versions.

==History==
3 Series vehicles can be largely differentiated by the series number:
* [[BMW 3 Series#E21.2C 1975-1983|BMW E21]] - (1975–1983) 3 Series
* [[BMW 3 Series#E30.2C 1982-1992|BMW E30]] - (1983–1991) 3 Series

{{main|BMW 3 Series (E21)}}
The E21 line was produced from May 2, 1975 (1977 in the USA) through 1983. Originally a replacement for the [[BMW New Class|2002]] [[coupe]], the first 3-Series was a 2-door model only. The [[BMW New Class|New Class sedans]] would be replaced by the [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series]]. A factory authorised cabrio version was built by [[Karosserie Baur|Baur]]. The series was superseded by the [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|BMW E30]] platform.

The cockpit design of the E21 marked the introduction of a new design concept, with the center console angled towards the driver. This feature has become part of BMW’s interior design philosophy for many years. As a sign of passive safety, all edges and control elements within the interior were rounded off and padded.

At the E21's release, three models were available: with 316 (1.6 litre), 318 (1.8 litre) and 320 (2.0 litre) versions of the BMW M10 four cylinder engine. To draw clear visual distinction within the new model series, the 320 models came with dual headlights, while the 316 and 318 had single round headlights.

At the 1977 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], BMW unveiled its new variants of the E21, featuring the new [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] M20 engines. The four cylinder 320 model was replaced with the 320/6, featuring a 2.0 litre version of the M20 engine. The 323i model was introduced, featuring 2.3 litres and {{convert|143|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The braking system was also upgraded, with the 323i featuring disc brakes on all wheels.

For the 1979/80 model year, the four-cylinder models were upgraded: the 1.8 litre power unit was revised and entered the market as a {{convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} carburetor engine in the 316, while addition of Bosch K Jetronic fuel injection to the 1.8 litre engine raised the 318i to {{convert|105|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.

Since there was now also room for a new entry-level model, the 315 powered by a {{convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.6 litre M10 engine made its appearance in 1981.

}}
{{main|BMW 3 Series (E30)}}
The E30 was sold from 1982 through 1991 in sedan form, through 1993 in convertible form. The E30's introductory price of [[USD|US$]]18,210 was nearly double that of the E21 just 7 years earlier, but the availability of a [[Straight-6|six cylinder]] engine and 4-door body style (in 1984) earned sales. The torquey "eta" six in the 325e produced 121&nbsp;hp (90&nbsp;kW) and {{convert|172|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, but met the strict emission standards of the time. The E30 was the most powerful compact BMW offered in the United States since the [[BMW 2002|2002 Tii]].

The lineup was joined in 1985 by the high-output 325i and 325is. Though the engine displacement was reduced to 2.5&nbsp;[[Liter|L]], output was up to 168&nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] (125&nbsp;[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]]) but torque dropped to {{convert|164|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} as the company focused on performance rather than economy. The rev limit for the new motor was raised from 5000 rpm to 6500 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]].

The 325is was an upgrade from the standard 325i, as some new features were added to the car as standard. These included the full electrics package, BMW sports seats, black roof-liner, BMW "iS" rear lip spoiler, front 2" valance spoiler, BMW 14 inch BBS wheels "Basketweaves" and a Close Ratio gearbox. Other features also found on the 325is were options, however over time, some have been mistaken for standard features. These options include a Limited Slip Differential (LSD), leather interior, sunroof and BMW 15 inch BBS wheels (with an offset of ET24, were only available in Europe, Japan and the Middle East). Options differed on vehicles produced in the United States.

An [[all wheel drive]] version, the 325ix, joined the lineup for 1986. The four-cylinder 318 was dropped in 1985, but was brought back with a new, 1.8&nbsp;L [[DOHC]] motor (M42B18) for 1991.

In the end of 1987, BMW introduced the touring version of the E30. It was very popular during its production up to 1994. It was available with a 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 or 2.5 liter engine and also 2.4 liter turbo diesel. The 325ix touring was equipped with 4WD.

The most powerful American BMW E30 in 1989 came in the form of the [[BMW M3|M3]]. It used a 192&nbsp;hp (143&nbsp;kW) ''[[BMW S14|S14]]'' [[straight-4]] with a [[multi-valve|4-valve]] head adapted from the ''[[BMW M88|M88]]'' six and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[fuel injection]].

{{main|BMW 3 Series (E36)}}
The '''E36'''  BMW 3 Series is a [[entry-level luxury car]] / [[compact executive car]].  It was the successor to the [[BMW E30]] and was eventually superseded by the [[BMW 3 Series (E46)|BMW E46]] starting in 1999 for sedans, and 2000 for coupes and cabriolets.  The E36 was introduced in late 1990.

The E36 experienced enormous success in the market. It laid strong foundations for the success that the BMW E46 experienced in subsequent years.

The E36 was sold from 1991 through 1999. It employed the "Z-axle" multilink suspension in the rear which had been proven in the Z1. [[VANOS]] variable valve timing was introduced on the DOHC engines in 1993.

The four-door E36 was sold from Autumn, 1991, in the United States but the E30 coupes were retained until well into 1992. The E36 convertible was delayed until 1994. The hatchback 318ti Compact was introduced in 1995, was very popular in Europe, but it was not very successful in North America. The BMW Compact was identical to the regular E36 sedan from front bumper to A-Pillar. Everything else was unique, namely its rear semi-trailing arm suspension, based on the old E30, instead of the Z-Axle Multilink employed in all other E36's. The Z3 and M Coupe have similar rear suspension setups as well. The "Touring" station wagon was sold in Europe from 1995, but was not offered in the United States.

The 2.5 L M50B25 used in the 325 models was replaced in 1996 with the 2.8 L M52B28, creating the 328i line. Another 2.5&nbsp;L engine, the M52B25, was reintroduced in 1998 but the cars were sold as 323 rather than 325.

[[Image:BMW E46 rear 20080822.jpg|left|thumb|2002 E46 Sedan Facelift]]
The '''E46''' is the fourth generation of [[BMW]]'s 3 Series [[entry-level luxury car]] / [[compact executive car]]. The sedan was introduced in 1998 and replaced the [[BMW 3 Series (E36)|E36]] sedan the same year. The smaller-engined version, despite having a 2.5L engine, was designated "323," not "325," to increase the apparent spread between it and the correctly-numbered (to purists) 328. The [[Station wagon|touring]] and [[coupé]] models appeared in 1999 with BMW's newly designed [[steptronic]] [[semi-automatic transmission]]s (available in all 3 series models), and the convertible and [[BMW M3|M3]] later in 2000. The E46 [[BMW Compact|Compact]], a 3-door hatchback, was revealed in 2001 to be sold in European and Australian markets. XDrive was introduced as an option in 2001.

In 2000, the E46 lineup received an engine boost when the new [[BMW M54|M54]] engines appeared for Model Year 2001 cars; with the new 3.0&nbsp;L 330 replacing the 328, BMW renamed the 2.5&nbsp;L car the 325. Outside of the engine and exhaust upgrades, there were few cosmetic changes, the most noticeable being the 330 receiving silver accents on the front fascia.

Also in 2000, the E46 lineup expanded to include the new (model year) 2001 M3 Coupe. The M3 only came in a coupe and convertible (model year 2002) platform, with either a 6 speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|SMG]]. Unlike its predecessor, the E46 M3 shared very few parts with the standard 3 series. The exteriors of the two cars only shared the doors, roof, and trunk. The exterior of the M3 had wider fenders and "M styled" bumpers, side skirts, mirrors, a protruding hood, spoiler, and the new tradition of M marked grills on the front fenders and four exhaust pipes. The interior of the M3 was accented with an M steering wheel, seats, rear view mirror, and instrument cluster.

The first major overhaul occurred when the E46 sedan underwent a [[Facelift (product)|facelift]] in 2002, which included re-designed headlights, new bumpers and a stiffer chassis. Also, the 316i and 318i models received new, more powerful engines. Then in 2004 the coupe and convertible had a facelift which included new headlights, new front wings and bumpers, new selections in exterior colour, and redesigned sidemarker lights and LED tail lights.  The M3s got a much more mild facelift that same year, with the inclusion of the updated boot and LED tail lights from the coupe/convertible.

Despite being introduced last, the E46 compact was the first to be replaced when [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]] was launched in September 2004. In mid-2005 the E46 sedans were phased out with the introduction of the new [[BMW 3 Series (E90)|E90]] saloons. The E46 touring was also replaced later that year with [[BMW 3 Series (E90)#Touring (E91)|E91]]. The E46 remained in production as coupé, convertible and [[BMW M3|M3]] until the E92 coupé and E93 convertible was revealed in late 2006. The new M3 coupé concept was later unveiled in March 2007 during [[Geneva Motor Show]].

The E46 experienced enormous success in all markets and was widely considered the performance benchmark of its class. The record year for the E46 was 2002, when 561,249 vehicles were sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/01/27/178201.html | publisher=The Auto Channel | accessdate=2006-07-24 | title=Successful 2003 Financial Year for the BMW Group}}</ref>

As a credit to the E46 platform, it was chosen for [[Car and Driver|Car and Driver Magazine]]'s "10 Best Cars" every year of its production. See [[Car and Driver Ten Best]].

[[Image:2009 BMW 328i sedan.jpg|left|thumb|2009 BMW 328i sedan (Facelifted) (USA)]]

The E90 is the currently available generation, which debuted as a sedan (E90) and wagon (E91) for the 2006 model year, coupe (E92) and cabriolet (E93) for the 2007 model year {{Fact|date=March 2009}}. It is completely re-engineered from the E46, including changes to engines, transmission, the passenger compartment, suspension technology, as well as the addition of a host of high-tech features and options. The coupé/cabriolet body is now its own design and no longer derived from the sedan (unlike its predecessors), and is slightly longer and narrower than its E90 counterpart.  Major features include [[Advanced Key|Comfort Access]], bi-Xenon [[Headlamp#Advanced front-lighting system .28AFS.29|adaptive headlamps]], [[adaptive cruise control|Active Cruise Control]], and [[Active Steering]]. The sedan and wagon received a mid-generational facelift for the 2009 model year which comprised changes to the grille, headlights, tailights and trunk. The coupe and cabriolet are expected to be refreshed in the 2011 model year.

Currently, four engine options are offered, two being part of the new 'N' series of BMW inline engines featuring a host of new technologies. Technological innovations such as lightweight magnesium/aluminum construction, electric water pump, [[Valvetronic]] (steplessly variable valve lift), and Double-VANOS steplessly [[variable valve timing]] contribute to produce a lighter and more powerful motor than its predecessor, but yield a 15% increase in fuel economy. The E90 also marks BMW's return to turbocharging with the introduction of the BMW 335. The N54 engine produces {{convert|306|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} torque.

The E90 series also marks the return of —a [[Convertible#Retractable hardtop roof|retractable hardtop]] convertible, which last featured on BMW Individual models of the E36 M3.

Sales of the E90 have been very strong in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 2007, a record total of more than 58,000 vehicles were sold and it was the seventh most popular car in Britain.<ref>http://www.economicnews.ca/login.php?page=reportsDetails&newsid=38779&prevview=&view=details&country=Europe&plimit=0&category=European%20Economic%20Reports</ref>

==Future models==
The next full revision of the 3 Series is expected in for the 2012 model year, and will feature improved aerodynamics, lightweight materials and the option of smaller displacement engines. A hybrid version is still under consideration.

==Awards and recognition==
The 3 Series has been on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's annual [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best]] list 18 times, from 1992 through 2009, making it the longest running entry in the list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/best_worst_lists/2009_10best_cars_10best_cars+page-2.html |title=2009 10Best Cars - 10Best Cars/Best/Worst Lists/High Performance/Hot Lists/Reviews/Car and Driver |publisher=Car And Driver |date=2008-03-23 |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>  The E90 was named "Best New Sports Sedan" in the 2006 [[Canadian Car of the Year]] awards. Also, it was awarded the ''[[World Car of the Year]]'' at the [[New York Auto Show]] in 2006. Ironically, it received the [[Top Gear (Series 7)|2005 Top Gear Award]] for being the ugliest car in the world - with [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and [[Richard Hammond]] saying that it was 'dull' and that it is just some '15ft of ''car'' '.  BMW emerged as the brand winner at the International Engine of the Year Awards for 2007 with its award in the 2.0 to 2.5 liter segment won by the 2.5 liter 6-cylinder petrol engine with VALVETRONIC, which is found in the BMW 325i.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newbmwseries.com/2009/10/seven-international-engine-of-the-year-awards-won-by-bmw/ | publisher=New BMW Series | accessdate=2009-10-23 | title=New BMW Series Reporting}}</ref>

The 3 Series has received nearly unanimous critical praise; it is consistently ranked as one of the top three vehicles on [[Seven Car Garage]]<ref>[http://sevencargarage.com/Vehicles/Small-Cars/bmw-3-series-328i-2009 Seven Car Garage - BMW 3-Series]</ref>.

==Racing==
The original E30 M3 is considered one of the most successful race cars ever{{Fact|date=August 2008}}.

The E36 320d won the [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] in 1998, after the M3 had won in the previous years.

The [[World Touring Car Championship]] (WTCC) is one of the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA's]] three World Championships (along with [[Formula One]] and the [[World Rally Championship]]).  [[Andy Priaulx]] and BMW Team UK won the ETCC in 2004, and continued the winning form in WTCC in [[2005 World Touring Car Championship season|2005]] in an E46 3-series, while the E90 3-series repeated this feat in 2006 and 2007.  The 3-Series' [[rear-wheel drive]] layout and design have both been attributed{{Who|date=August 2008}} to its victory, though in [[Touring Car Racing]], as almost every other motor sport, the skill driver and their team tactics are also important.

The 3-Series cars in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC) and other touring car championships have been penalized under racing rules for being rear-wheel drive and thus having better grip than its front-wheel drive competitors. For example, the 320si has been penalized in the WTCC in previous seasons in order to keep the sport competitive with the rest of the grid ([[Ford Focus (International)|Ford Focus]], [[Chevrolet Lacetti]], [[SEAT Leon]], [[Alfa Romeo 156]]). Despite these ballast weight penalties, the 320si's of the British, German and Italian/Spanish teams continually win races and points.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}
However, in the middle of the 2002 [[European Touring Car Championship]] (ETCC) season, FIA changed the handicap rules to add an extra {{convert|15|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ballast to front-wheel drive cars (such as the [[Alfa Romeo 156]]) and the ballast in rear-wheel drive cars (including BMW) was reduced by {{convert|15|kg|lb}}.<ref name="fiatouringcars.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatouringcars.com/2k4/Default.asp?callPage=Archive2002/contentReadNews.asp&id=275|title=NEWS [ 275 ] - 26 Jun 2002 FIA WORLD COUNCIL APPROVES ETCC RULE CHANGES|accessdate=2008-02-05|work=fiatouringcars.com}}</ref>  Today, the WTCC series has a rolling start to eliminate the benefit of better grip that rear-wheel drive cars have from a standing start.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}
[[Image:WTCC 2006 Race 10 Curitiba later.jpg|thumb|[[Andy Priaulx]]'s BMW 320si (E90) during the [[2006 World Touring Car Championship season]].]]

The BMW 3-Series is currently used in both the SCCA Pro Racing [[Speed World Challenge]] Touring Car Series and the [[Grand American Road Racing Association]] Series. In the final 2006 Grand Am standings, BMW finished second in the manufacturer's standings in both the Grand Sport and Street Tuner classes, while E46 BMWs prepared by [[Turner Motorsport]] won the driver's and team championships.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}
