The '''Opel Kadett''' is a [[small family car]] produced by the [[Germany|German]] automaker [[Opel]] between 1937 and 1940, then from 1962 to 1992.

[[Delta Motor Corporation|Delta]] in [[South Africa]] used the Opel Kadett name until 1999.

The first Opel car to carry the Kadett name was presented to the public in December 1936 by Opel's Commercial-Technical director, [[Heinrich Nordhoff]], who would in later decades become known for his leadership role in building up the [[Volkswagen]] company.   

The new Kadett followed the innovative [[Opel Olympia]] in adopting a chassis-less [[monocoque]] construction, suggesting that like the [[Vauxhall 10-4|Vauxhall 10]] introduced in 1937 by Opel's English sister-company, the Opel Kadett was designed for high volume low cost production.  Competitive pricing led to commercial success, and Kadetts continued to be produced during the early months of the [[Second World War|war]]: by the time production was interrupted in 1940 following intensification of [[World War II|hostilities]], 107,608 of these Opel Kadetts had come off the assembly line at Opel's Rüsselsheim plant, which had been the first major car plant in Germany to apply the assembly-line production techniques pioneered by [[Henry Ford]]. 

After the war, Opel production facilities from Rüsselsheim (cars) and [[:de:Opelwerk Brandenburg|Brandenburg an der Havel]] ([[Opel Blitz|trucks]]) were crated up and transported to the [[Soviet Union]] as part of a larger reparations package agreed upon by the victorious powers.  From 1948 the prewar Kadett was manufactured as the [[Moskvitch 400/420]]: it continued to be produced on the edge of [[Moscow]] as a Moskvitch until 1956.

The first Opel Kadett after the war appeared in October 1962.   

In 1957 Opel Product Director Karl Stief was mandated by [[General Motors]] headquarters in Detroit to develop "the perfect Anti-Volkswagen" ''(„einen perfekten Anti-VW")''.   The development team was headed up by Stief, supported by Hans Mersheimer (car-body) and Werner K. Strobel (engine and running gear), under conditions of such secrecy that even now very little is known of the development history of the 1962 Kadett.  649,512 of cars had been built at the company's new [[Bochum]] factory by the time it was replaced in July 1965. 

The car later became known as the Kadett A. In addition to the standard [[sedan (car)|saloon]] there was an L (luxury model), a [[coupé]], and an [[station wagon|estate]] (called '''Caravan'''). The new [[Opel OHV engine]] was available as 1.0 with 40&nbsp;hp (30&nbsp;kW) and as 1.0 S with 48&nbsp;hp (36&nbsp;kW).

The Kadett clearly featured a much more modern design than the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]] which then dominated the market for small family cars in Germany and various surrounding countries.   The Kadett offered more passenger space, massively more luggage space and a much less encumbered view out.   Its water cooled engine enabled it to provide a far more effective heater.   Even fuel consumption was under most conditions superior to that of the Volkswagen, and many commentators much preferred the Opel's handling and its light and effective brakes to those of the market leader.   

However, by the mid-1970s the Kadett's greatest relative weakness was already painfully apparent, as the cars disappeared rapidly from German roads while the Beetles endured.  The Kadett's bodywork was not well protected from corrosion.

==Kadett B (1965&ndash;1973)==

The Kadett B was sold from 1966 to 1973, with two- and four-door saloons (the latter in [[notchback]] and, from 1967, also in [[fastback]] form), a three-door estate, and two coupés (regular and fastback, or Coupé F). There was a sporting Opel Kadett Rallye, with a 1.9&nbsp;L engine. Additionally, the two-seat [[Opel GT]] was heavily based on Kadett B components, its body made by a French contractor, [[Brissonneau & Lotz]].

Between 1965 and 1973 Opel produced 2,691,300 Kadett Bs<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23>{{cite journal| authorlink = Günther Zink  (verantwortlich)| title =Oldtimer Katalog| journal = | volume = Nr. 23| pages = Seite 265|date = 2009|isbn = 978-3-86852-067-52009|publisher=HEEL Verlag GmbH|location=Königswinter }}</ref> which makes this model one of the most successful Opels to date in terms of sales volume.   The Kadett benefitted on the domestic market from a progessive slowing of demand for the old [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]], while the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Volkswagen Golf]] which would compete for sales more effectively against the Kadett C both got off to a relatively slow start respectively in 1968 and 1974.  

A "luxury" derivative of the Kadett B was sold as the [[Opel Olympia|Opel Olympia A]].

The Kadett B was sold in the [[United States]] through [[Buick]] dealers from 1967 until 1972 simply as the '''Opel'''. U.S. models were later granted the front end and trim of the new [[Opel Olympia]], introduced in 1966 as an upmarket version of the Kadett. The car took part in the [[Trans-Am Series]] during its commercial life. Kadett A and B were technically simple cars whose task was to compete with the market leader, the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. This lack of sophistication caused the U.S. car magazine ''[[Car and Driver]]'' to publish a highly critical test of the Kadett in 1968, featuring photos of the car in a junkyard. Reportedly, GM withdrew any ads from that magazine for several months as a consequence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The Kadett C appeared in 1973 and was Opel's version of [[General Motors T-car|General Motors' "T-Car"]]. The T-Car was also built in Japan by [[Isuzu]] and sold as the [[Isuzu Gemini]] and in Australia where it was marketed as the [[Holden Gemini]]. In [[South Korea]], [[Saehan Motor]] then [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo Motor]] built a version known as the '''[[Daewoo Maepsy]]''' and Maepsy-Na. 

The Kadett C formed the basis of the British [[Vauxhall Chevette]], which had a restyled front end and launched with a [[hatchback]] body, in addition to using a 1256&nbsp;cc OHV (over-head valve) Vauxhall engine rather than the 1196&nbsp;cc OHV Opel engine. The Chevette made the Kadett C notable by allowing it to become Opel's first hatchback &mdash; a version named '''Kadett City''' appeared in August 1975,<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975/> based on the Chevette's hatchback body. Although Kadett C production ended in 1979, the Chevette was produced until January 1984. Unusually for Vauxhall models, the Chevette was imported to Germany starting in 1979 to satisfy the needs of the rear wheel drive traditionalists and was quite a success for a year or two.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The Kadett C today is a cult car in Germany, especially in [[fastback]] (coupé) form. The most sought after versions of the Kadett C Coupé are the Rallye and GT/E models. These models were built first with the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] fuel injected 1897&nbsp;cc OHC (over-head cam) Opel engine, and followed by the updated 1998&nbsp;cc OHC engine. [[Right-hand drive]] versions of these sports models are now rarely seen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Included in the range from 1976<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1976/> was very rare version, the '''Aero-Kadett''', an open-top Kadett with targa roll bar, detachable roof insert and a separate convertible top aft of the roll bar (like the contemporary [[Lancia Beta|Lancia Beta Spider]]). This car was built in very limited numbers by [[Karosserie Baur]] in [[Stuttgart]].  One clue concerning its rarity is the manufacturer's recommended retail price of DM 15,500 at a time when Volkswagen's trusted (if slower and heavier) [[Volkswagen Type 1|1303 Cabriolet]] was offered for DM 12,735.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1976>{{cite journal| authorlink = cpb| title =Kurztest: Kadett Aero : Windjammer.

The Kadett C reached the United States as the '''Buick–Opel'''. In reality, however, this was an Isuzu Gemini; an updated version of this car was marketed in the USA as the '''Isuzu I-Mark''' in the early 1980s.

In [[Brazil]], the Kadett C was released six months before its European release, as '''Chevrolet Chevette'''. It was available with a choice of three [[petrol engine]]s, in 1.4&nbsp;L, 1.6&nbsp;L, and 1.0&nbsp;L displacements (the latter available only for the 1992/3 model year); 1.4&nbsp;L and 1.6&nbsp;L versions were also available running on [[ethanol]]. This Chevette went through several redesigns &mdash; first front and rear panels similar to the Opel version, then a look similar to the British Vauxhall Chevette, and finally a design reminiscent of the updated USA [[Chevrolet Chevette]] version. It was available in several different bodies: hatchback (1979–87), estate (called [[Chevrolet Marajó]], 1980-89), [[Pickup truck|pickup]] (Chevy 500, 1984–95) and saloon (1973–93). The Chevette sold over 1.6 million units in Brazil, being replaced by the [[Chevrolet Corsa]].

The Kadett D was introduced in 1979, going on sale in the UK some five months before the British version, the [[Vauxhall Astra]] Mark 1, was launched in April 1980. All models were designed as three- or five-door hatchbacks and estates or [[station wagon]]s. There were also two- and four-door sedans, which used the same bodyshells as the hatchbacks, but these were soon dropped.

Technologically, the Kadett D was a major departure, as it was Opel and Vauxhall's first front wheel drive car. It also introduced the [[GM Family II engine|Family II]] [[engine]] design with an [[single overhead camshaft]], [[aluminium]] [[alloy]] [[cylinder head]], [[hydraulic]] valve lifters, with capacities of 1300 and 1600&nbsp;cc, and had a unique transaxle design which allowed the clutch to be replaced without removing the transmission unit. Later, an 1800&nbsp;cc version was introduced for the Kadett/Astra GTE model. This range of engines was also used for later models of the [[General Motors Corsa|Corsa/Nova]], and the mid-sized [[Vauxhall Cavalier|Cavalier/Ascona]]. The Kadett D was also equipped with a 1600 cc diesel engine that was possible to drive as cheap as 5.0 L/100&nbsp;km.

The Kadett E (Vauxhall Astra Mark 2 in the UK) was introduced in 1984, and was voted [[Car of the Year]] in 1985, largely due to its advanced [[aerodynamic]] body styling. The 1984 model was also developed into a more conventional "three box" design with a boot (trunk), badged as the '''Vauxhall Belmont''' in the UK and the '''Opel Monza''' in South Africa. A convertible version was also available, for the first time in 1987, built by Bertone of Torino/Italy. For the 1988 model, capacities were raised to 1400, 1800 and a new 2000&nbsp;cc engine, again used on the GSi and Vauxhall Astra GTE. In 1988, a 16-valve twin-cam version was developed for a high performance GSi/GTE model, yielding 156&nbsp;hp (115&nbsp;kW) in manufactured form. 

The Kadett E has been seen as a [[grey import]] in the UK, but it is not as popular as the Vauxhall Astra Mark 2. It was never officially sold in Britain, and by 1989 [[General Motors]] was only marketing the Vauxhall brand in the UK.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, South African Kadett GSi's were upgraded for touring car competitions and around 500 were built for homoligation purposes. They featured more aggressive cams, a locally developed limited slip differential and special 15" wheels, they were nicknamed the Superboss, produced {{Convert|125|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}.

The Kadett E was introduced in Brazil as the '''Chevrolet Kadett''', but the three-door station wagon was called the '''Chevrolet Ipanema'''.

It formed the basis of the [[Daewoo LeMans]] (later known as the '''Daewoo Cielo''', '''[[:de:Daewoo Racer|Racer]]''' and '''[[Daewoo Nexia|Nexia]]''') in [[South Korea]], and also as '''Heaven''' in Chile ('''Nexia''' being the HB version), which was sold in the United States and [[New Zealand]] as the [[Pontiac LeMans]], and in [[Canada]] (initially) as the Passport Optima. LeMans sales ended in 1993. The Nexia is still being produced at [[UzDaewoo]] plant in Asaka, [[Uzbekistan]]. The Cielo was last being produced at a semi-independent (from GM) plant in [[Craiova]], [[Romania]] (the license expired in fall 2006).

==Kadett F==
In 1992, GM Europe decided to standardise model names across its two brands, and Opel adopted Vauxhall's name for the Kadett, [[Opel Astra|Astra]], for the replacement car for Europe which débuted that year. Only in South Africa did the Kadett name continue on the first Opel Astra hatchback, until 1999, when all models took the Astra name.
