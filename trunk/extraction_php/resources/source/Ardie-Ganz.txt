'''Ardie-Ganz''' was the name of an [[automobile]] [[prototype]], built in 1930 by German engineer [[Josef Ganz]] at the German motorcycle manufacturer [[Ardie]].

==History==
In 1930, Ardie President Willy Bendit assigned German engineer [[Josef Ganz]] to build a prototype of a small [[Volkswagen]] according to his design. This Ardie-Ganz prototype was finished in September 1930 and achieved highly successful road-test results. The car featured a tubular chassis, mid-mounted engine, and [[Independent suspension|independent wheel suspension]] with [[Swing axle|swing-axles]] at the rear.<ref>Article ‘''Der Ardie-Versuchs-Kleinstwagen 1930'',’ ''Motor-Kritik'' magazine, issue 18, mid-September 1930.</ref>

==The Volkswagen Beetle connection==
With the Ardie-Ganz, [[Adler]] [[Maikäfer]] and [[Standard Superior]] cars, as well as his progressive writings and promotion of the concept of a Volkswagen in [[Motor-Kritik]] magazine since the 1920s, Josef ganz is claimed by some to be the inspiration behind the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].

==New investigation==
While the Volkswagen Beetle was produced in its millions after World War Two, the name of Josef Ganz was largely forgotten. In 2004, Dutch journalist [[Paul Schilperoord]] started researching the life and work of Josef Ganz. He has unearthed many new facts and is currently working on a new book and documentary.
