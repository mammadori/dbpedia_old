'''Zündapp''' was a major [[Germany|German]] [[motorcycle]] manufacturer. The company was originally founded in 1917 in [[Nuremberg]] by Fritz Neumeyer, together with the Friedrich [[Krupp]] AG and the [[machine tool]] manufacturer Thiel under the name "'''Zünd'''er- und '''App'''aratebau G.m.b.H." as a producer of [[detonator]]s. In 1919, as the demand for weapons parts declined after the [[World War I|First World War]], Neumeyer became the sole proprietor of the company and two years later, he diversified into the construction of [[motorcycle]]s. The company folded in 1984.

The first Zündapp motorcycle was the model '''Z22''' in 1921. This was the ''Motorrad für Jedermann'' ("motorcycle for everyone"), a simple and reliable design that was produced in large series. Zündapp's history of heavy motorcycles began in 1933 with the K-series. The "K" stands for ''"Kardanantrieb"'', ''i.e.'' enclosed driveshaft with two universal joints, the type of  drivetrain that these models used. They introduced the enclosed engine case, a novelty at the time. The series encompassed models from 200 to 800&nbsp;[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] [[Engine displacement|displacement]] and was a major success, increasing Zündapp's market share in Germany from 5% in 1931 to 18% in 1937.

From  1931 [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and Zündapp developed the prototype ''Auto für Jedermann'' ("car for everyone"), which was the first time the name "[[Volkswagen]]" was used. Porsche preferred the 4-cylinder flat engine, but Zündapp used a water-cooled 5 cylinder radial engine. In 1932 three prototypes were running. All three cars were lost during the war, the last in 1945 in [[Stuttgart]] during a bombing raid.

From 1936 to 1938 Zündapp produced the KKS500 model. This was the first Zündapp with a foot gearchange, and 170 examples were built.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/1937-zundapp-kks500.aspx|title=1937 Zundapp KKS500|publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=2009-08-04|date=July/August 2009|author=Greg Williams}}</ref> From 1940 onwards Zündapp produced more than 18,000 units of the KS750.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/Motorcycle-Reviews/1942-Zundapp-KS750.aspx|title=1942 Zundapp KS750|publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=2009-08-11|date=July/August 2007|author=Margie Siegal}}</ref> This is a [[sidecar]] outfit with a driven side wheel and a [[locking differential]], supplied to the German [[Wehrmacht]].

After the [[World War II|Second World War]] the company gradually shifted to producing smaller machines, notably the "Bella" [[motor scooter]], which was however a relatively heavy machine for its type. In 1951 Zündapp released the last of its heavy motorcycle models, but also one of its most famous: the KS601 (the "green elephant") with a 598&nbsp;cc two cylinder engine. From 1957 to 1958 the company also produced the [[Zündapp Janus]] [[microcar]].

In 1958 the company moved from Nuremberg to [[Munich]]. Subsequently, the company developed several new smaller models, discontinued the development of [[four-stroke cycle|four-stroke]] engines and only produced [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] models. Initially, Zündapp scooters and [[moped]]s sold well, but later sales declined and in 1984 the company went bankrupt and closed.

Zündapp models were taken over and built in the 1980s by [[Enfield India]]. Enfield India developed a link with Zündapp, and built a plant in Ranipet near [[Chennai]] in the 80’s to manufacture small, light weight two stroke two wheelers. Enfield India launched a slew of light weight machines. The 50 cc Silver Plus step-through and Explorer motorcycle and the Fury 175 and these bikes redefined the entry-level segment. The Fury with a five-speed gearbox came fitted with a hydraulic disc brake a first in the country.
