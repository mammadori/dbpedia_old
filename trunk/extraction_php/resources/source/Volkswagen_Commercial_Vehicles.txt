===Unique Volkswagen commercial vehicles===
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles have made some rare commercial vehicles in its 50 plus years of producing commercial vehicles.  One of them was a small postal van which was built at the request of the German Postal Services, in 1964 the [[Volkswagen Type 147 Kleinlieferwagen|Type 147 or Kleinlieferwagen]] was made, it has also coined the nickname Fridolin.

From 1975-1979, VWCV produced for developing countries a small FWD truck called the [[Volkswagen EA489 Basistransporter]], with a rudimentary chassis and basic metal sheeting.  It was easily manufactured from semi knocked down kits into a light truck.<ref>http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/ws_oct_2000/Weird_Vans02.html</ref>

In 1989, VWCV partnered Toyota to build the [[Toyota Hilux]] pick-up truck rebadged as a [[Volkswagen Taro]].  This partnership was to help Toyota build sales in Europe and give VW a vehicle in the 1 tonne pick-up segment.  The venture was not a huge success, and it split in the late 1990s.<ref>Volkswagens of the World by Simon Glen pages 151 and 152</ref>

Volkswagen's first [[joint venture]] into [[truck]]s outside of their own [[Volkswagen LT|LT range]] was with [[MAN SE|MAN Nutzfahrzeuge (Commercial Vehicles)]] from 1977-1993.  Truck production started in 1979 and ended in 1993 with 72,000 units produced.  It was available with four engines and four [[wheelbase]]s over its lifetime; there was also a 4X4 version called 8.150 FAE.  FAE means "forward control" cab, all-wheel drive, single tyres so the F nomenclature means "forward control" cab.

MAN AG supplied engines which were available in [[inline-four engine|inline-four]] and [[straight-six engine|inline-six]] cylinder [[engine configuration]]s, with [[DIN]] rated [[motive power|motive]] [[power (physics)|power]] outputs of:

*{{convert|67|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}
*{{convert|75|kW|PS bhp|0}}
*{{convert|101|kW|PS bhp|0}}
*{{convert|112|kW|PS bhp|0}}

[[MAN SE|MAN AG]] replaced the G series as it was known internally with the L2000 and M2000 ranges.

VWCV and MAN shared the project development in accordance with the collaboration agreement as follows:

Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles took care of:
*the tilting driver's cab including steering wheel and fixing, hand levers and foot pedals.
NOTE the [[Volkswagen LT|VW LT Mk 1]] cabin was used for the MAN-VW range, the cabins are wider than the standard [[Volkswagen LT|LT]] cabins so they can fit the truck chassis
*the complete interior equipment and heating
*the manual gearbox with clutch and gear lever, the rear axle with rear-axle transmission and suspension
*the cardan shafts including bearings
*the electrical system for the entire concept, and the platforms for the standard design.

MAN was responsible for:
*the engine including cooling, exhaust, inlet and fuel system
*the front axle with suspension and steering
*the frame with all parts for attaching the springs and axles, the steering, the batteries, the power braking system and fuel system
*the brakes, i.e. for the complete wheel brakes front and rear, the dual-circuit power brakes and parking brake
*the wheels and tyres
*the platform for special designs and tipping mechanism.

MAN-VWCVs were built in Volkswagen's [[Hanover]] factory until other Volkswagen models took priority; they were then made at MAN AG's Salzgitter-Watenstedt factory.

MAN-VWCV Range 6.90, 8.90, 6.100, 8.136, 8.100, 8.150, 9.136, 9.150 & 10.136.
''F & FAE are sometimes on the end of some of these model numbers.''

Several models of the MAN-VWCV and the VWCV LT ranges were marketed in Spain by [[Enasa]] as [[Pegaso]] Ekus, in a typical [[badge engineering]] operation.
