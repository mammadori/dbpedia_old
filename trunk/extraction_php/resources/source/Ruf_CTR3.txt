The CTR3 was released 20 years after the original [[Ruf CTR]], on April 11, 2007 at the [[Bahrain International Circuit]] in Sakhir, [[Bahrain]] where Ruf's new [[factory]] is located. Continuing the Ruf tradition of modifying [[Porsche]] automobiles, the CTR3 shares both the body panels and engine from Porsche. For the first time, however, it features an Ruf designed body.  Built out of [[steel]], [[aluminum]], and [[kevlar]]-[[carbon]], the car altogether weighs 1,375 [[Kilogram|kg]] (3,050 [[Pound (mass)|lb]]).  The [[engine]] of the CTR3 is a Porsche derived 3.8 [[Litre|L]] [[flat-6]] paired with twin [[AG Kühnle, Kopp, and Kausch|KKK]] turbochargers; this means the CTR3 produces 515 [[Kilowatt|kW]], or 700 [[Horsepower|hp]] at 7,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], and has a maximum [[torque]] of 890 [[Newton metre|N·m]] (657 [[Foot-pound force|lbf·ft]]).

As for performance, the CTR3 has a top speed of approximately 375 [[Kilometre per hour|km/h]] (235 [[Miles per hour|mph]]), and [[acceleration|accelerates]] from 0–100&nbsp;km/h in 3.1 [[second]]s.

==Price==
As of April 2007 the CTR3 is priced at approximately [[Euro|€]]380,000 plus [[Value added tax|VAT]], or over $510,000 [[United States dollar|USD]].
