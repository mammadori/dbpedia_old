The '''Audi TT''' is a [[sports car]] manufactured by [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry|automaker]] [[Audi|Audi AG]] since 1998 in [[Győr]], [[Hungary]].  It is now in its second generation &mdash; and available as a [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] [[coupé]] or two-seater [[roadster]].

==Origins==
The development of the Audi TT began in September 1994 at the Audi Design Center in [[California]].{{Fact|date=May 2009}}  The TT was first shown as a [[concept car]] at the 1995 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]].  The design is credited to [[J Mays]] and [[Freeman Thomas]],<ref>[http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-tt.php Audi TT Unveiled<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with [[Martin Smith (designer)|Martin Smith]] and Romulus Rost contributing to the award winning interior design.  A previously unused [[laser welding]] adaptation which enabled seamless design features on the first-generation TT also delayed its introduction.

Audi did not initially offer an [[automatic transmission]] option for the TT.  A [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG) became available, the first for a production car, in 2003.

==Name==
The Audi TT takes its name from the successful racing tradition of [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Isle of Man TT]] [[motorcycle sport|motorcycle race]].  NSU began competing in the TT in 1911, and later merged into the company now known as Audi.<ref>

The Audi TT also follows the [[NSU Prinz|NSU 1000TT, 1200TT and TTS]] cars of the 1960s in being named for the race.

The [http://www.audi-tt-roadster.ru Audi TT Roadster] was presented in Detroit in 1999 under the name Audi TTS.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}

{{Refimprovesect|date=May 2009}}
The production model (internal designation '''''Typ'' 8N''') was launched as a [[Coupé]] (TT-C) in September 1998, followed by a [[Roadster]] (TT-R) in August 1999, based on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A4 (PQ34)|Volkswagen Group A4 (PQ34) platform]] used for the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]], the original [[Audi A3]], the [[Škoda Octavia]] and others.  The styling differed little from the concept, except for slightly reprofiled bumpers, and the addition of a rear quarterlight windows behind the doors.  Factory production commenced October 1998.

Mechanically, the TT uses a [[transverse engine|transverse]]ly mounted [[internal combustion engine]] with [[front-wheel drive|front]] or ''[[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]]'' [[four-wheel drive]].  It was first available with a 1.8&nbsp;[[litre]] [[straight-4|inline four cylinder]] [[multi-valve|20-valve]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine, with either {{convert|180|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} or {{convert|225|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}.  The engines share the same basic design but the 225&nbsp;PS version features a larger turbocharger, an additional [[intercooler]] on the driver's side, forged connecting rods, a dual exhaust, and a few other internals designed to accommodate the increase in turbo boost from roughly 10&nbsp;psi peak to 15.  [[Haldex Traction]] enabled [[four wheel drive]], 'branded' as "quattro" was optional on the {{convert|180|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} engine, and standard on the more powerful version.
[[Image:1st Audi TT convertible.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Audi TT Roadster (US)]]

Early TT models gained press coverage for a series of high-speed accidents in Europe.  Reported crashes and related fatalities occurred at speeds in excess of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}, during abrupt lane changes or sharp turns.  Both the coupé and roadster models were [[product recall|recalled]] in late 1999/early 2000, to improve predictability of the car's [[car handling|handling]] at very high-speeds.  Audi's [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]], and rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] were added, along with suspension modifications.  All changes were subsequently incorporated into future versions of the car.

The original four cylinder engine range was complemented with a {{convert|250|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} 3.2&nbsp;litre [[VR6 engine]] in early 2003, which comes as standard with the quattro four-wheel drive system.  In July 2004, a new [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG) (dual-clutch) gearbox, which improves acceleration through drastically reduced [[shift time]]s, was offered, along with a stiffer suspension.

Factory production of this generation ended in June 2006.

===TT quattro Sport===
In 2005, Audi released the limited edition (800 sold in the UKs not the 1000 originally planned) '''TT quattro Sport''' (known as the '''TT Club Sport''' in Europe).  It had increased power from its 1.8&nbsp;litre turbocharged engine - rising to {{convert|240|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|236|lb|abbr=on}} ft of torque - and a reduction in weight of {{convert|49|kg|lb|0|lk=on}} to {{convert|1416|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, which gave an electronically limited top speed of {{convert|250|km/h|mph|0|lk=on}}.  This was also assisted by deleting the spare wheel, and by taking out the rear parcel shelf and rear seats.  Lightweight fixed-back [[Recaro]] bucket seats graced the interior.  Distinguishable from other TT coupés by its two-tone paint scheme (black painted roof, pillars and mirror housings, in combination with either Avus Silver, Phantom Black, Mauritius Blue or Misano Red body colour), and unique 18" 15-spoke aluminium alloy wheels, plus the same body kit as fitted to the TT 3.2 V6, it also had uprated suspension settings, V6-spec brakes fitted, and the new wheels were wider at the rear for improved grip.

===8N engines===
The 8N [[powertrain]] options comprise of the following [[internal combustion engine]]s and drivelines:

===Lawsuits===
There are two class action lawsuits affecting specific model years of the first generation TT.

On 22 June 2007, Pearson, Simon, Soter, Warshaw & Penny, LLP and the Law Office of Robert L. Starr filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against [[Volkswagen Group of America]], alleging that the [[timing belt]]s for [[model year]] 1999-2003 Audi and Volkswagen vehicles equipped with a 1.8&nbsp;litre turbo-charged engine fail prematurely.<ref>[http://www.timingbeltsettlement.com/pdfs/Settlement.pdf TimingBeltSettlement.com]</ref>  The vehicles included are the Audi TT, [[Audi A4]] and [[Volkswagen Passat]].  The complaint alleges that the timing belts fail prior to the service interval, as stated in the owner's manual.  The parties have reached a class-wide settlement, and preliminary approval of the settlement was granted by the court on 19 May 2008.  Claim forms, class notice, and other documentation will be mailed on or about 1 August 2008.  Details regarding the terms of the settlement will be in the notice sent to owners of the class vehicles.<ref>[http://www.psswplaw.com/CM/ClassActions/Volkswagen.asp Pearson, Simon, Soter, Warshaw & Penny, LLP: Audi and Volkswagen Timing Belt Failures]</ref>

On 22 January 2008, the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, entered an order preliminarily approving a nationwide settlement of a class action lawsuit brought by Green Welling LLP, on behalf of all current and prior owners and lessees of 2000-2004, and 2005 model year Audi TTs.  The lawsuit and settlement relate to allegedly defective instrument clusters, and Audi TT owners are entitled to submit claims for repairs, replacement and/or cash reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, and all TT owners covered by the suit will receive a 2-year extension of their existing 4-year warranty (limited to the instrument cluster).<ref>[http://www.classcounsel.com/news/audi.html Green Welling LLP: Audi TT Instrument Cluster Settlement]</ref>

===8N awards===
The original generation Audi TT was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year]]'' award for 2000.  It was also on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 2000 and 2001.

A preview of the second-generation TT was provided in the form of the [[Audi Shooting Brake]] [[concept car]], shown at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] in 2005.  This concept was an insight into the new TT, but featured angular styling, and a "[[shooting brake]]" 2-door hatchback body style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2005/10/11/audi-tt-shooting-brake-to-debut-at-tokyo/|title=Audi TT Shooting Brake to debut at Tokyo|date=2005-10-11|work=Autoblog.com|accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref>

Audi revealed the second-generation TT, internal designation '''''Typ'' 8J''', on 6 April 2006.  It is constructed of [[aluminium]] in the front, and steel in the rear, to enhance its balance, and is available in front- or four-wheel drive layout.  Factory production commenced during August 2006.

===8J powertrain===
The [[powertrain]] options initially only included [[petrol engine]]s, which consist of either one of two [[straight-4|inline four cylinder engines]] - the 1.8&nbsp;[[litre]] [[turbocharger|Turbocharged]] [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (TFSI) (available in Germany), or the more common 2.0&nbsp;litre&nbsp;TFSI.  The Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) technology was derived from the Audi [[Le Mans]] endurance race cars, and offers improved fuel efficiency as well as an increased power output and cleaner emissions.  The 3.2&nbsp;litre [[VR6 engine]] is carried over from the previous generation, and this engine was also available in the Canadian model.<ref>[http://microsites.audicanada.ca/my09/pdf/ca/2009_Audi_TT_TTS.pdf 2009 Audi TT / TTS]</ref>

A six-speed [[manual transmission]] is standard, with the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (now called "S tronic" on all Audi models) as an option for all but 1.8&nbsp;litre engine.  [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] four-wheel drive, again using the [[Haldex Traction]] clutch is standard on V6 models, but was not available on 1.8&nbsp;TFSI.  2.0&nbsp;TFSI quattro models began available in 2009 model year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audi.co.uk/audi/uk/en2/about_audi_ag/news/Audi_TT_range_gathers_momentum_for_2009.html|title=Audi TT range gathers momentum for 2009|date=2008-12-22|work=www.Audi.co.uk|publisher=Audi UK|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>

===8J suspension & other features===
Audi's new active suspension, "Audi Magnetic Ride", is available as an option, and is based on [[Delphi Corporation|Delphi]]'s [[MagneRide]], which uses [[magneto rheological damper]]s (this means that the suspension will automatically adjust its damping properties depending on the current road conditions and driving manner).

The new TT also features an improved rear spoiler which automatically extends at speeds greater than {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and retracts again at {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The spoiler can also be manually controlled by the driver via a switch on the dash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Overview-c8186-2008-TT.html|title=2008 Audi TT|work=CarGurus.com|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref>  It is again offered as a 2+2 coupé, and as a roadster.

===2.0 TDI quattro{{anchor|TT TDI}}===
In 2008, Audi offered the first [[diesel engine]]d version of Audi TT as a quattro model, available in Coupé and Roadster versions, in the [[Europe]]an market.<ref>[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/04/28/audis-new-tt-tdi-is-going-on-sale-this-spring-in-europe/ Audi's new TT TDI is going on sale this spring in Europe]</ref>  Audi claim average fuel consumption on the engine is {{convert|5.3|L/100 km|mph|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} in the [[coupé]] variant.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lienert, Anita|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=125972|title=Audi TT TDIs Debut - but Not in U.S.|work=[[Edmunds.com|Edmunds]]|date=[[April 29]] [[2008]]|accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref>  It includes a six-speed manual transmission.

===TTS quattro{{anchor|TTS}}===
At the 2008 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], Audi released the '''Audi TTS quattro'''. The [[cylinder block]], [[cylinder head]] and the fuel injectors have all been modified from the base 2.0 TFSI engine. The engine is rated {{convert|272|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] from 2,500 to 5,000rpm.<ref>Audi UK [http://www.audi.co.uk/audi/uk/en2/new_cars/tt/tts/engine.html The nerve centre of the Audi TTS quattro]</ref>
