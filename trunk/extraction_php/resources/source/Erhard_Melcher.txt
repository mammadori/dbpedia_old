'''Erhard Melcher''' (born 1940) is a [[Germany|German]] [[engineer]] who was one of the founders of [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG Engine Production and Development]], a current subsidiary of [[Mercedes-Benz]].

When Aufrecht moved AMG to larger premises in [[Affalterbach]], Melcher left the company to work independently in [[Burgstall]]. He and his small company keep supplying engine designs and parts to AMG, e.g. for the Mercedes [[Formula 3]] engine that dominates the [[Formula Three Euroseries]].
