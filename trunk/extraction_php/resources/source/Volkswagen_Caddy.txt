The name '''Volkswagen Caddy''' has been used by the [[Volkswagen Group]] to describe four different Caddy models:

*''Typ'' 9K was derived from the [[Volkswagen Polo Mk3]] (VW Caddy) / [[SEAT Ibiza]] ([[SEAT Inca]]) platform,
*''Typ'' 9U was derived from the [[Škoda Felicia]] pick-up,
*''Typ'' 2K was derived from the [[Volkswagen Touran]] platform with [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf Mk5]] front suspension.

[[Image:Vw caddy 1 a sst.jpg|thumb|Caddy ''Type'' 14 with a [[recreational vehicle|camper kit]] attached to the bed]]
Released in 1980, the first '''Volkswagen Caddy''' is a light [[pickup truck]], and [[van]] based on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A1|Volkswagen Group A1 platform]], shared with the [[small family car]] [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1]].

*147 = LHD 
*148 = RHD

===Caddy debuts internationally as a Rabbit===
The Caddy came into fruition when [[Volkswagen]] was experimenting with [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] derivatives, an [[station wagon|estate]] and a pickup.

[[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] was interested in the pickup, when Volkswagen released the Caddy it first was produced at the VWs [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1982.
 
It was known in [[North America]] as the '''VW Rabbit Pickup''' with trim levels such as LX and Sportruck.<ref name=autogenerated1>Volkswagen Driver, December 2005, page 47 to 50 - UK Publication</ref>

The Caddy competed with other mini-pickups such as the [[Ford Courier]] and [[Subaru Brat]] of that time.

===Caddy debuts in Europe===
The Caddy nameplate was never used in the USA (since the name is slang for [[Cadillac]] motor car division).  Its first use was in [[Europe]] in 1982, when the Caddy was debuted on the European Market.

European Caddys were built in [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|Volkswagen's plant]] TAS in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] from 1982 till 1992.

{{As of|2006}}, these original variants are still produced in [[South Africa]].  The stamping equipment was shipped from [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], [[Pennsylvania]], the home of Volkswagen's only U.S. manufacturing plant, now defunct.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===Engine specs===
The 1980-1984 Caddy pickup used the following engines:
* 1.0 petrol
* 1.3 petrol
* 1.5 petrol
* 1.5 diesel (1980)
* 1.6 petrol
* 1.7 petrol
* 1.6 diesel w/turbo in Canada and abroad

The current (post 2003) South African-spec VW Pickup (Caddy name dropped to not conflict with Caddy 2K) 
is only available with a 1.6 carb-fed engine producing 60 kW.

However during its long production in South Africa it has been available with the following engines:
* 1.6 petrol 63 kW

==Caddy ''Typ'' 9K (1996-2005) {{anchor|9K}}==
[[Image:Vw caddy 2 sst.jpg|thumb|Caddy II (Typ 9KV)]]
Released in 1996, the Volkswagen Caddy ''Typ'' 9K was a light van designed by the VW's Spanish subsidiary [[SEAT]], and derived from the [[SEAT Ibiza|SEAT Ibiza 6K]] / [[Volkswagen Polo Mk3|VW Polo 6N]], on the [[Volkswagen Group A0 platform#A03|Volkswagen Group A03]] platform, Polo 6N sharing the same platform parts as the Ibiza 6K.

It was built in [[Spain]], at the [[Martorell]] factory of SEAT.  This version of the Caddy was built from 1997 to 2003 in [[Europe]].  Its twin, the [[SEAT Inca]], was quickly phased out when the SEAT [[marque]] was re-aligned as the "sporty" branch of the [[Volkswagen Group]].

It is still under production in [[Argentina]] for the [[Latin America]]n market.<ref>[http://www.volkswagen.com.ar/_modelos_inicio.asp?vModeloNav=caddy Volkswagen Caddy website for Argentina]</ref>  It received a cosmetic facelift in 2005, similar to the post-1999 [[Volkswagen Polo Mk3]]. 

'''Features'''
*length 4.2 m
*loading area 2.6&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>
*loading volume of 2.9 m<sup>3</sup>
*payload 550&nbsp;kg
*two rear wing doors standard
*partition separating loading from driving space

*dust and pollen filter
*side impact protection 
*safety steering column with collapsable steering wheel
*two head restraints
*three point seatbelts
*drivers airbag passenger optional
*ABS with Electronic Differential Lock (EDL)
*air-conditioner

Note: The Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) employed by Volkswagen is not - as the name suggests - a differential lock at all. Sensors monitor wheel speeds, and if one is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping), the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers all the power to the other wheel.
