The '''Mercedes-Benz GL-Class''' ([[code name]] ''X164'') is a [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[crossover SUV]] built by the German carmaker [[Mercedes-Benz]] since 2006. The GL-Class debuted at the 2006 [[North American International Auto Show]]. The car was designed for the American market, which is shown by its large size, making it the only similarly-sized rival up against [[Audi Q7|Audi's Q7]], along with the redesigned [[BMW X5]], as well as a facelifted [[Volvo XC90]] by that time. It is the seven-passenger counterpart of the [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]].  Although the car was designed for the US market, it is also sold in Europe, albeit in far fewer numbers. It competes with the [[Cadillac Escalade]], [[Range Rover Sport]],[[Range Rover]],[[Infiniti QX56]], [[Hummer H2]], [[Toyota Land Cruiser]], [[Lexus LX 570]], and [[Lincoln Navigator]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

It lacks the typical SUV boxy styling and [[body-on-frame]] construction of the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|G-Class]] in favor of a modified version of the M-Class's [[unibody]] architecture. Many motorists consider it the "Elongated and Wider" version of the recently redesigned M-Class. It is a three-row, seven-passenger [[SUV]] with much more luxurious equipment than previous civilian G-Class vehicles. All GL-Class vehicles are assembled at Mercedes-Benz US International, Inc., Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. The GL class was originally intended to replace the 25-year old G-Class model, however due to public and fan outcries, Mercedes Benz had decided to keep the G-Class in production for the foreseeable future and decided to update it for 2006.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Mercedes-Benz introduced its [[BlueTec]] [[Diesel engine|diesel]] system to the GL-Class at the 2006 North American International Auto Show as the GL 320 Bluetec. This system uses [[urea]] to clean diesel emissions, making the GL 320 50-state legal in the United States. It went on sale in July 2006, but models with urea injection will only be introduced in 2008.
