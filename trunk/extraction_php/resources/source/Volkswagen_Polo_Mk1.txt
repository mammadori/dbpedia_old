The original Polo (known internally as the ''Typ 86''), a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] version of the [[Audi 50]], was introduced in 1975.  The differences between the Audi and VW models were minor, with the Polo being cheaper and much more basic.  The two cars were initially sold alongside each other, but the Audi 50 never sold as well, and was withdrawn in 1978.  The Polo was manufactured at the Volkswagen plant in [[Wolfsburg]].  In 1977, the Derby sedan was released, which was simply a Polo, identical to the hatchback from the [[C-pillar]] forward, with a large boot attached (an old [[Audi]] proposal, but never sold by this brand{{Fact|date=March 2009}}). 

When first on sale the range topping car, the LS model, featured the 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) 1043&nbsp;cc engine found in the Audi 50.  Other specifications included parking lights, rear wash wipe, sun visors, chromed bumpers and 4.5J X 13" wheels.  The N model was the basic starting spec lacking many of the features of the LS.  In 1979 the GLS was introduced, replacing the LS as the range-topping car; specification upgrades included chrome headlight and grill surrounds, sunroof, a cigarette lighter and chrome wheel trims.

895&nbsp;cc, 1093&nbsp;cc and 1272&nbsp;cc engines were used, with the smaller one used only in the Polo hatchback, and the 1272&nbsp;cc only in the Derby, Audi 50, and the rare Polo GT.  Different levels of compression were used on each size to achieve different power outputs, and the variations are numerous, often differing depending on the country of sale, ranging from 34 to 60&nbsp;PS (26 to 44&nbsp;kW).

The Mark 1 Polo and Derby were facelifted in 1979 (unofficially referred to as the Mark 1F) with plastic bumpers, a different front grille and a revised dashboard.  The round headlights of the Derby were replaced with square ones, bringing it inline with the similar Golf-based [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] sedan.

Further models were added including CLS, S and an out run LX model.  The Mark 1's production run finally ended in October 1981 with over 500,000 Polos sold worldwide.
