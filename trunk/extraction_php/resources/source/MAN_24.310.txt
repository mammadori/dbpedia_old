'''[[MAN SE|MAN]] 24.310''' is a [[low floor]] [[double decker bus]] model built for the [[Hong Kong]] market. Unlike other low-floor double decker buses in Hong Kong, there are steps in the lower deck aisle after the rear exit.

For the type code 24.310, 24 means that the bus has the maximum gross weight of 24 tonnes, whilst 310 means that the maximum power of the engine is {{Convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

==Hong Kong==
===History before introduction===
In 1998, [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] ordered a number of MAN 24.310 buses with [[Berkhof]]/[[Volgren]] bodywork after the trial of an [[Australia]]n-built MAN 24.350. However in early 1999, [[Transport Department (Hong Kong)|Transport Department of Hong Kong]] set quota on the number of buses owned by Citybus, and therefore the order was cancelled involuntarily.

At that time, construction of 32 Berkhof-bodied buses and 2 Volgren-bodied buses had been completed, so MAN had to find buyers for these buses. Finally, one Berkhof-bodied bus was retained by MAN for testing, and the others were sold for operations in Hong Kong.

===Kwoon Chung Motors===
In 1999, Kwoon Chung Motors, a coach and rental bus operator in Hong Kong, took over one of the Berkhof-bodied MAN 24.310 abandoned by Citybus and put the bus into service in 2000.

The bus was primarily used as a staff bus (for [[Hong Kong International Airport]]). But during rush hours, it could be seen allocated to [[New Lantao Bus]] (subsidiary of Kwoon Chung) routes in [[Tung Chung]].

===Kowloon Motor Bus===
[[Kowloon Motor Bus]] took over the other 32 MAN 24.310 buses abandoned by Citybus. 30 buses with Berkhof bodywork entered service in 2000. The 2 buses with Volgren bodywork, which were once stored in Volgren's facility at [[Melbourne, Victoria, Australia|Perth]], [[Australia]], entered service in 2002.

Later, KMB ordered 15 MAN 24.310 buses with Volgren bodywork. They had the staircase moved forward, had yellow instead of red handrails and no seats were fitted above the front wheels. They entered service in 2002.

All of these 47 buses are allocated to [[Tuen Mun]] Depot and mainly run on express routes serving [[Tuen Mun]], [[Tsuen Wan]], [[Kwai Tsing]] Districts and [[Kowloon]].
