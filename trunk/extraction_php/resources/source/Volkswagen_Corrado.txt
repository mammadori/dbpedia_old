The '''Volkswagen Corrado''' is a [[hatchback]] [[coupé]] developed by German automaker [[Volkswagen]] and built by [[Karmann]] in [[Osnabrück]], [[Germany]] between 1988 and 1995.

Conceived as a successor to the successful [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]], it is a three-door [[hatchback]] with a [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] seating layout. The Corrado used Volkswagen's [[Volkswagen B platform|B3 platform]] in the rear of the car, while using the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A2|A2 platform]] technology up front, which it shared with the then-current [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|Golf Mk2]] and [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]].  It shared many mechanical parts with other [[Volkswagen A platform]] cars as well.  In 1990 the Corrado went on sale in the [[United States]].

The Corrado offered exceptional handling for its time, and was listed as one of the "25 Cars You Must Drive Before You Die" by the British magazine, ''Car''. All models featured an innovative rear spoiler which automatically raised when the vehicle reached a set speed (45–65 mph depending on the region). Perceived as too expensive, it reached a production total of just 97,521 vehicles according to [http://www.vwcorrado.de VWCorrado.de]. However, many owner clubs exist around the world, and it has become something of a modern classic.

==Variants==
All Corrados were [[front-wheel drive]] and featured [[petrol engine]]s. It debuted with two [[internal combustion engine|engine]] choices: a 1.8&nbsp;litre, [[multi-valve|16-valve]], [[straight-4|inline-4]] with {{convert|136|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} as the base model and a [[supercharged]] 1.8&nbsp;litre, 8-valve inline-4, marketed as the [[G60]], and delivering {{convert|160|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}}. The first engine was initially available only in [[Europe]]. The G60 is named for the ''[[G-Lader#Sizes_and_car_models|G-Lader]]'' with which it is equipped, a [[Scroll compressor|scroll]] supercharger whose interior resembles the letter "G".

Volkswagen introduced two new engines for 1992.  The first was a naturally aspirated 2.0&nbsp;litre, 16 valve, {{convert|136|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} inline-4, basically a further development of the 1.8&nbsp;litre engine. The second was the highly-regarded 2.8&nbsp;litre, 12-valve, {{convert|174|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} [[VR6 engine]], Specific to the United States. The Canadian and European market versions had a displacement of 2.9&nbsp;litre and {{convert|190|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}}, which was sold side by side with the G60 for 1992. The G60 was dropped from the U.S. line-up the following year. The VR6 was revolutionary at the time because it combined the benefits of both V-shaped and straight engines, by placing the two cylinder banks at an angle of 15° with a single cylinder head. This design allowed engineers to fit a six-cylinder engine into roughly the same space that was previously occupied by four-cylinder engines.

In a last-ditch attempt to popularize the car, a 2.0&nbsp;litre 8-valve model was produced in Europe in 1995.  Its uninspiring performance did not make up for the impressive standard spec and lower price, and production ceased in Europe, with the UK-only limited production model, the Corrado VR6 Storm. Some discreet "Storm" badging, a colour-keyed front grille, 15&nbsp;inch [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] "Solitude" alloy wheels, and standard fitment of some previously optional items (such as the leather heated front seats) were all that differentiated this model from the base Corrado VR6.  Only 500 were produced, 250 in Classic Green, and 250 in Mystic Blue (unique to the Storm).

==Reception and reviews==
[[File:VW Corrado rear 20070920.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rear-view]]
The Corrado was generally well received by the automotive press of its time{{Fact|date=January 2008}}, yet failed to capture the hearts of the general public{{Fact|date=January 2008}}. A high price tag, coupled with a [[marque]] that was not known at the time for producing sports cars{{Fact|date=January 2008}} caused the Corrado to be looked over in favour of the other similarly priced, better known sports cars of its time{{Fact|date=January 2008}}.

As of more recent years, the automotive press have shown high regard for the Corrado and its capabilities as a sports car. On the BBC television show Top Gear, host [[Richard Hammond]] stated that the Corrado "... drives as well as if not better than a lot of current cars" and also described it as "...properly quick". A recent article on MSN Auto lists the Corrado as one of eight "Cool Cars We Miss".

In 1991, the price of the Corrado was very comparable to the BMW 318.
