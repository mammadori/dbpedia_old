The '''Volkswagen LT''' was the largest [[panel van]] produced by [[Volkswagen]] (and consequently [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] as of 1996) from 1975 to 2006.  Two generations were produced.

===Conception history===
As early as the Spring of 1950, [[Volkswagen]] had exerted a decisive influence on the market for [[light commercial vehicle]]s in [[Germany]] and [[Europe]], with the renowned [[Volkswagen Type 2]].  The name "Kombi" (the name under which the Type 2 was sold in Brazil) rapidly established itself as a concept term to describe an entire [[commercial vehicle]] segment.  Through the continuous development of the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2]], above all after the introduction of the revised [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen Type 2#T2]] in 1968, additional demand was shown, especially from commercial customers.  Increasingly heavier and larger-volume [[freight]] items required transportation using compact commercial vehicles.  This saw the classic [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2]] reaching the limits of what was possible, in part conditioned by the rear mounted engine design.

===Design===
The set of specifications for the new larger transporter, as an additional series, were very clear in requiring as much utility space as possible in a small footprint.  The planned tonnage classes; from 2.8&nbsp;[[ton]]s [[gross vehicle weight rating|gross vehicle weight]] upwards to 3.5&nbsp;tons, called for a strong traction [[rear-wheel drive|rear drive]], and ruled out a rear engine placement in accordance with the original spacial requirements.  As a result, the engine was located above the front [[axle]], between the driver and passenger seat in a [[cab over]] layout.

===Launch===
The new Volkswagen van celebrated its launch in 1975 in [[Berlin]].  The name given to Volkswagen's large transporter was as functional as the entire vehicle: it was just called '''LT''', which is simply the abbreviation of '''''Lasten-Transporter''''' (or '''cargo transporter''').

This van also became quite popular after the hit TV cartoon ''Scooby-Doo'' was released and became mainstream.

===Range===
The LT came in three gross vehicle weights, from 2.8 to 3.5&nbsp;[[ton]]s ('''LT&nbsp;28''', '''LT&nbsp;31''', '''LT&nbsp;35'''), with two [[wheelbase]]s, two roof options, and with bodywork options as a [[panel van]], a compact, a platform vehicle and a [[chassis cab]] combination.

The ratio of utility space to footprint was nothing short of sensational: thanks to the [[cab over|cab-over-engine]] construction and the overall width of {{convert|2.02|m|1|lk=on}}, even the compact LT panel van (with the short wheelbase and little over four and a half meters in length) offered a load length of over three meters and a load area of around 5.5&nbsp;[[square metre]]s.

Even at that time, Volkswagen's transporter developers placed great value on secure and comfortable handling.  For that reason, the LT was equipped with a front axle with [[independent suspension|independent front wheel suspension]], which at that time and in later years, was not standard in this class of vehicle.  Later options, such as the heavy '''LT&nbsp;40''' to '''LT&nbsp;55''', had a rigid front axle for reasons relating to load-carrying capacity; this is remains common procedure today on more modern light trucks.

===Engine upgrades===
In time, problems were presented by the choice of [[internal combustion engine]]s for the original LT, and Volkswagen's own stocks offered only the familiar [[Volkswagen air cooled engine|air-cooled boxer engines]] for [[rear-engine design|rear mounting]].  The dimensions of the new generation of engines for the [[Volkswagen Golf]], which was launched at practically the same time, were too small, as was the power unit on the still youthful mid-class [[Volkswagen Passat]] saloon.

A suitable [[petrol engine]], at that time still the ''standard'' engine even for transporters, was identified at [[Audi]], a sister company within the then [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen Audi Group]] (VAG) in 1976.  The biggest engine from the [[Audi 100]], an [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] engine with a [[engine displacement|displacement]] of 2.0&nbsp;[[litre]]s (also used by the [[Porsche 924]]), proved suitable, and was adapted to the specific requirements of a [[commercial vehicle]].  Accordingly, the developers cut back on performance, to {{convert|55|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}, in favour of achieving higher [[torque]] at lower engine speed, making more suitable for hauling heavy loads.

At the same time, a [[diesel engine]] was developed at [[Perkins Engines Company Limited|Perkins]], a well-known [[United Kingdom|British]] diesel engine manufacturer.  The inline-four cylinder 2.7&nbsp;litre engine, included in the LT range from 1976 onwards, developed just {{convert|48|kW|PS bhp|0}}, did not run particularly smoothly, and had an unpleasant sound to it.  LTs equipped with this engine are typically not favoured by LT enthusiasts, due to their infamous characteristics.

Volkswagen reacted quickly; from August 1978, the Perkins engine was replaced with one of their own diesel engines that had proved successful on the [[Volkswagen Golf]] - while adding two more [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]].  The Golfs' 1.6&nbsp;litre four-cylinder engine became the [[Volkswagen D24 engine|D24 2.4&nbsp;litre six-cylinder]], delivering {{convert|55|kW|PS bhp|0}}.  Unlike other diesel engines in this performance class, the assembly stood out for its balanced vibration behaviour and pleasing acoustics.  The engine worked so convincingly that [[Volvo]] adopted it for the [[Volvo 200 series]], and were therefore able to offer the first passenger car with a six-cylinder diesel engine.

From December 1982, [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] made a significant upgrade to the LT - the second phase of the first generation, following eight years of production.  The desire for improved performance resulted in the six-cylinder diesel engine's availability as a [[turbodiesel]], the [[Volkswagen D24T engine]], providing {{convert|75|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}}.  This saw the LT become the most powerful [[van]] in [[Europe]] — and the same was true of its maximum torque of {{convert|195|Nm|0|lk=on}}.  In addition, the six-cylinder engine was now also available as a {{convert|66|kW|PS bhp|0}} petrol engine.  The engines, which were now mounted with a clear offset alignment, allowed for a flatter engine compartment which was shifted further to the rear, allowing more space for a third seat in the [[cab]].

In 1986, an overhauled turbo-diesel engine with [[intercooler|charge air cooler]] and {{convert|70|kW|PS bhp|0}} was introduced - the [[Volkswagen D24TIC engine]].

===Exterior upgrades===
The first decade of the LT saw no change in terms of its appearance, however 1986 saw a [[facelift (automobile)|facelift]], leaving the previously round [[headlamp|headlights]] becoming rectangular in shape, as well as other minor cosmetic retouches.  In Spring 1993, there was again a modest change in the look, with new grey-plastic elements introduced to the radiator [[grille]] and in the rear lighting section.

===Other upgrades===
The second phase of the first generation LT in 1983 also included a redesigned dashboard, and the undercarriage had an additional third wheelbase as an option for platform-type vehicles, at up to 4.6&nbsp;meters in length.

Two years later, [[Volkswagen]] again increased the gross vehicle weight, with the 5.6&nbsp;ton '''LT&nbsp;55'''.  Users were delighted by an option on the LT&nbsp;35, which could be supplied with a single-tyre rear axle — bringing benefits in terms of through-loading dimensions between the wheelhouses, which were now thinner.  For extreme requirements, there was an LT with [[four-wheel drive]] that could be enabled from within the cab.

===Retirement===
The last first generation LT was produced in 1996, which corresponds to a British 'P' registration plate.

===Campervan versions===
A touring camper in its various bodywork and fitting options was also produced.  When compared to the then-current [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2]] (which still remains a stubborn favourite among campervan enthusiasts), the possibility of beds set out crosswise due to the generous width of the LT become apparent.  Many campervan solutions of the LT exist, due to their popularity amongst amateur and professional campervan converters alike.  A more official conversion was produced, as with the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2]] [[Volkswagen]]-endorsed [[Westfalia]] ''California'' model that was available at the time, a model known as the ''Florida'' was available for the LT.

===Truck cabs===
In addition, the wide yet compact cab-over-engine design of the LT was ideally suited for use on much larger utility vehicles.  This meant that it was used on the so-called "G Series", the light truck in a [[joint venture]] between [[Volkswagen]] and [[MAN SE|MAN AG]], with gross vehicle weights of between six and ten tons.  It was built from 1979 until 1993.

A further career for the LT cab opened up in [[South America]].  For many years, Volkswagen's Brazilian plant at [[Resende]] has been constructing trucks with weights of between 7 to 35&nbsp;tons.  Even after the launch of the new [[Volkswagen Constellation]] in 2006, [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] has continued to manufacture vehicles incorporating cabs clearly based on the first generation of the LT.  The LT has even made a career for itself as a racing vehicle; for the past two years, the [[Volkswagen Titan]] has succeeded in winning the European Cup in the Super Truck Race.  Its cab is similarly based on the first generation of the LT's cab.

===[[Rebadging]]===
In the late eighties, German-built Volkswagen LT and MAN-VW G were sold in Spain as '''[[Pegaso]] Ekus''', while Brazilian-built units were marketed in USA as '''[[Peterbilt]] Midranger'''.

===''Typ'' codes===
The Volkswagen "''Typ'' codes" for the first generation LT were:
*'''''Typ'' 28''' &mdash; April 1975 to July 1991
*'''''Typ'' 21''' &mdash; August 1991 to December 1995

===Conception history===
The demand for the first generation LT is defined by the exceptionally long period for which it was manufactured.  After 21 years and just under half a million vehicles, shortly after the foundation of the [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] brand in 1995, came the second generation of the LT in 1996.

In 1996, [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] and [[Daimler-Benz|Daimler]]'s [[Mercedes-Benz]] Commercial unit debuted the fruits of their [[joint venture]] - the second generation LT would share a body shell with the new [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]], however the engine and transmission would be [[Volkswagen Group]] sourced.  This deal would continue on in the [[Volkswagen Crafter]], successor to the LT.

===Design===
As with the new [[Volkswagen Eurovan]] (Transporter T4), the second generation of the LT abandoned the one-box design in the cab-over-engine construction which had characterised Volkswagen utility vehicles for over four decades.  With an [[longitudinal engine|engine mounted longitudinally]] beneath a short hood and with [[rear-wheel drive]], the LT now adopted what had become the standard style of construction for bigger transporters.

In addition, it satisfied requirements which remain sought-after even today: economical [[direct-injection]] [[diesel engine]]s, easy access to the driver cab behind the front [[axle]], and a wide space between the driver and passenger seat.

===Range===
The range now went from 2.6 to 4.6&nbsp;[[ton]]s [[gross vehicle weight rating|gross vehicle weight]], and the enclosed options of the [[panel van]] and compact were available in three [[wheelbase]] options.  Platform vehicles, crewcabs and numerous undercarriage options completed the range.  A special [[articulated]] version of the second generation LT, the '''XLT''' was available through special order.

===Engine===
With a naturally-aspirated engine as well as three [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) diesel engines, [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] answered the call for economical and high-performance [[diesel engine]]s.  The basis for this was the same [[straight-five engine|inline-five cylinder]] TDI which had already established a positive reputation in the [[Volkswagen Eurovan]] (Type 2 T4) within a very short period of time.

For the first time, Volkswagen had profited from synergies between the two major in-house transporter series.{{clarify|date=July 2009}}

The performance range for the LT initially went from {{convert|61|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} to {{convert|96|kW|PS bhp|0}}.  In January 2002, [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] again raised the bar; a particularly powerful [[inline-four engine|inline-four cylinder]] 2.8&nbsp;[[litre]] engine increased power output to {{convert|116|kW|PS bhp|0}}, and the maximum [[torque]] to {{convert|331|Nm|0|lk=on}}.  At that time, these were once again record figures among vehicles in its class.  Compared to the most powerful engine on the first generation LT, it represented an increase in torque and performance of over 50%.

The 2.8&nbsp;litre engine's specifications were as follows:
*{{convert|2789|cc|1|lk=on}} [[inline-four engine|inline-four cylinder]], 93&nbsp;mm bore, 103&nbsp;mm stroke and three valves per cylinder
*rated output: {{convert|116|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} EEC @ 3,500&nbsp;rpm; {{convert|331|Nm|0|lk=on}} @ 1,800&nbsp;rpm
*Diesel [[common rail]] fuel system

And the 2.5&nbsp;litre:
*{{convert|2461|cc|1|lk=on}} [[straight-five engine|inline-five cylinder]], 81&nbsp;mm bore, 95.5&nbsp;mm stroke, 19.5 [[compression ratio]], and two valves per cylinder
*rated output: {{convert|80|kW|PS bhp|0}} EEC @ 3,500&nbsp;rpm; {{convert|280|Nm|0}} @ 1,900&nbsp;rpm
*Diesel direct injection fuel system
*KKK K14 turbocharger

===Retirement===
The second generation LT was manufactured for over nine years in total, with practically no external changes; testimony to its build quality.  By the end of production in the 4th Quarter of 2006, around 350,000 models had come off the production line.

Plans for the third generation of the 'large transporter' from Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles had already gone underway, and later that year the [[Volkswagen Crafter]] was launched.

===''Typ'' codes===
The Volkswagen "''Typ'' codes" for the second generation LT are:
*'''''Typ'' 2D''' &mdash; May 1996 to July 2006
