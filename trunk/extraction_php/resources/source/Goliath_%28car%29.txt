'''Goliath''' was a German car brand, active from 1928 to 1959 and which was part of the [[Borgward]] group. Goliath was based in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] and specialized in [[three wheeler]] cars and trucks and medium sized cars.

==Early history==
The company ''Goliath-Werke Borgward & Co.'' was created by [[Carl F. W. Borgward]] and Wilhelm Tecklenburg in 1928. The first models were three-wheelers trucks derived from the ''Blitzkarren'' previously built by Borgward. The first passenger car was the ''Goliath Pionier'' in 1931, which still had three wheels and a one-cylinder engine. Until 1934, 4000 of these small cars where produced in various types of body. The ''Pionier'' was considered as a forerunner of the [[Hansa (car)|Hansa]] models 400 and 500.

==After World War II==

These were front wheel drive two door sedans.

* [[Goliath GP700]] (1950-1957) — two cylinder, inline, two stroke, water cooled, transverse engine (anticipating the [[Mini]] and many recent cars). In 1952 introduced Bosch direct fuel injection, around the same time as the [[Gutbrod]] Superior 600; they were the first two cars to use this technology.

* [[Goliath GP900]] (1955-1957) — two cylinder, inline two stroke, water cooled, transverse engine, Bosch direct fuel injection.

* [[Goliath 1100]] (1957-1958) — [[flat-4|four cylinder opposed]] four stroke water cooled engine

* Goliath Dreirad (1955-1961)
* Goliath GV800 (1951-1953)
* Goliath Express (1953-1961)

==The End==
From 1958, the Goliath 1100 models were sold under the brand '''Hansa''', the Borgward group wanted to forget the two-stroke engine and three wheeler image.

Three years later, in 1961, the Borgward group collapsed.
