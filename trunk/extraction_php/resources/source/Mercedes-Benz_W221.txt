The '''Mercedes-Benz W221''' is a chassis code of [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]], the successor of [[Mercedes-Benz W220]].

The vehicle was unveiled in 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show.<ref>[http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-614289-1-817437-1-0-0-0-0-1-11702-854934-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html Mercedes-Benz at the International Motor Show: World premiere of the new S Class]</ref>

==Styling==
The W221 S-Class' exterior styling is distinctly different to the W220. The rear styling is similar to the [[BMW E65|E65]] [[BMW 7 Series]], and also the [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Maybach]] - the larger saloon from Daimler AG's flagship brand, which was presented to public in 1997.

Inside, the W221's interior is also significantly different from the preceding model. The interior features an instrument cluster shroud that also contains the navigation screen, with silver effect air vents below, and a square, analog [[clock]] within the vents. Below the vents are metal tab switches with a black field behind them, to control the [[HVAC]] system. On the center console, a metal control wheel for the [[Comand APS|COMAND]] system sits above a piece of wood, surrounded by metal buttons. Throughout the interior, many buttons are metal, with black fields above them denoting the switches' function.

The W221 is slightly larger in all dimensions than the W220, with a longer [[wheelbase]] and more interior room.

==Models==
===2009 facelift===
The revised 2009 S-Class was announced on Apr 08, 2009 at Stuttgart. The minor model update includes minor cosmetic changes and several new features:<ref>[http://www.inautonews.com/2009-mercedes-benz-s-class/ "2009 Mercedes Benz S Class complete details"]</ref><ref>[http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-614289-1-1205235-1-0-0-0-0-1-11702-854934-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html The 2009 Mercedes-Benz S-Class: Pacemaker in automotive development]</ref>

*Adaptive Highbeam Assist - detects vehicles with their lights on which are travelling towards or ahead of the car in which the system is fitted and controls the headlamps to ensure the largest possible range without dazzling other drivers.
*[[Blind spot monitor]]
*[[Lane departure warning system|Lane Keeping Assist]] - detects road markings and senses if the driver is inadvertently straying out of the lane. If so, the driver is warned by short vibrations of the steering wheel. This system can also distinguish between intentional (for example, overtaking or merging) and unintentional lane departures, reducing the number of false alarms.
*Speed Limit Assist - identifies speed limit signs in passing and shows the relevant speed limit in the central display. It is standard for S 600.
*Attention Assist - continuously monitors more than 70 different parameters to detect driver fatigue and tiredness. Once the system detects behaviour that typically indicates the onset of drowsiness, a warning signal is sounded and "ATTENTION ASSIST. Break!" appears in the instrument cluster. It is not standard on S 400 HYBRID.
*Active Body Control (ABC) crosswind compensation - uses the sensors of the Electronic Stability Program (ESP) to vary the wheel load distribution via the ABC spring struts, depending on the direction and intensity of the crosswind, in order to reduce the adverse effects of crosswinds. This is standard on the S 600.
*Torque Vectoring Brake - brakes the inside rear wheel during cornering to enhance handling and safety by reducing [[understeer]].

The updated models went on sale in June 2009. Early models include S 350 CDI BlueEFFICIENCY, S 450 CDI, S 350, S 400 HYBRID, S 450, S 500, S 600.

All models except S 63 AMG, S 600 L, S 65 L AMG use AIRMATIC suspension, with optional [[Active Body Control]] except for 4MATIC models. S 63 AMG, S 600 L, S 65 L AMG include [[Active Body Control]] as standard.

4MATIC models were unveiled in 2006 Paris Motor Show.<ref>[http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-614289-1-825127-1-0-0-0-0-1-11701-854934-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html Paris Motor Show 2006: A powerful display from Mercedes-Benz]</ref> Initial products include S 450 4MATIC and S 500 4MATIC, followed by S320 CDI 4MATIC in 2006-12, then S 350 4MATIC in mid 2007.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2006/09/12/farfromskiddin-mercedes-benz-s-class-4matic-unveiled/ Farfromskiddin: Mercedes-Benz S-Class 4MATIC unveiled]</ref> All 4MATIC models were made in short and long wheelbases.<ref>[http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-614289-1-824806-1-0-0-0-0-1-11702-854934-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html Overview: All-wheel-drive passenger cars from Mercedes-Benz]</ref> S 320 CDI 4MATIC was replaced by S 350 CDI 4MATIC.

===Safety===
*Brake Assist Plus: an optional system designed to apportion brake pressure based on pedal speed and distance between the car and objects. This is an evolution of the Brake Assist system found on earlier models, and uses the vehicle's radar, in addition to the usual Brake Assist's monitoring of pedal depression speed, to apply power brake boost as required. This requires the optional adaptive cruise control's radar, so in vehicles not equipped with the latter, standard Brake Assist is substituted.
*[[precrash system|Pre-Safe]]: a development of the previous Pre-Safe system fitted to the W220 S-Class, which uses vehicle-dynamic sensors to predict collisions, the W221's system also takes into account closing speed, as measured by the vehicle's [[radar]]. If a collision appears likely, Pre-Safe closes all windows and the sunroof, moves all passenger's seats and their head restraints to a safer position, and tightens the seatbelts.
*[[Electronic Stability Control|Electronic Stability Program]] (ESP): similar to the systems fitted to other Mercedes vehicles, this system measures driver inputs and compares these to the vehicle's path. If these diverge, ESP brakes single wheels selectively to eliminate oversteer (fishtailing) and understeer (plowing), and reduces engine power, if necessary.
*[[automotive night vision|Night View Assist]]: optional, uses two [[infrared|near-infrared]] (NIR) illuminators mounted in the headlamp clusters and a sensor in the windshield. The infrared beams are picked up by the sensor and an image is displayed in the instrument cluster. Mercedes-Benz claims that this system provides the same viewable distance as high-beam headlights, without blinding oncoming motorists.

The W221 also contains many other safety features, including front and rear crumple zones, eight dual-stage [[air bag]]s, seatbelt pre-tensioning devices, [[anti-lock brakes]] (ABS), collapsible steering column, and [[traction control system|traction control]].

===Equipment===
*Airmatic DC - [[air suspension]], similar to the system fitted to the [[Mercedes-Benz W211|W211 E-Class]], uses air springs and adaptive electronic control to sense road and driving conditions and produce a firm or soft ride. The air suspension is only available for the smaller engines up to S 500. The S 600, S 63, and S 65 AMG are equipped with an active suspension system called [[Active Body Control]], which is based on steel springs. ABC is also optional on all other models except vehicles equipped with 4Matic all wheel drive.
*Distronic Plus - optional, a development of the Distronic system fitted to earlier models. Uses more [[radar]] systems (long- and short-wave) and improved control logic to detect vehicles ahead and adjust the vehicle's speed to maintain a driver-set distance behind the car in front. The system has more authority over the vehicle than previous Distronic iterations, and can bring the vehicle to a complete stop if necessary, unlike the previous versions.
*Drive-Dynamic seats with massage - optional, an evolution of the system fitted to many other Mercedes models, uses air bladders in the seat bolsters to support the driver during cornering. Also, other air bladders provide a four-mode massage function to front-seat passengers.
*Heated and Active-Ventilated seats, with heating elements for warming the seats and small fans to keep the seats cool and draw perspiration away from occupants.
*[[Harman Kardon|harman/kardon]] Logic7 stereo sound system with 14 speakers, in-dash CD changer and [[PC Card]] slot
*Hard-drive based [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellite navigation system
*Revised [[Comand APS|COMAND]] navigation and radio control system, uses the dash-top display and a central knob to navigate menu choices and options. Most frequently-used functions (such as volume) can be controlled by dedicated switches.
*[[Fiber-optic]] ambient lighting for the dashboard, footwells, and other areas.
*Tele Aid, uses GPS tracking and cell phone service to provide assistance. Can be used for information, to call for roadside assistance, or to call for help in emergencies. Automatically calls for help if an air bag or seatbelt tensioner deploys.
* [[Cup holder]]s
