The '''BMW E46''' is the [[BMW_3_Series#E46.2C_1998-2006|fourth generation]] of the [[BMW 3 Series|3 Series]] [[compact executive car]]s produced by [[BMW]], produced from 1998 when it succeeded the [[BMW E36]] until it was replaced by the [[BMW E90]] in 2006.

The E46 was released in 1998 to worldwide markets (excluding the United States) in the [[sedan]] body style. In 1999, a [[coupé]] and [[Station wagon|touring]] body style became available to all markets, and the sedan was released in the United States. A [[convertible]] and [[BMW Compact|hatchback]] body style was released in 2000, the latter only for Europe and Australia. The E46 experienced enormous success in all markets and was widely considered the performance benchmark of its class.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/automobiles/24AUTO.html|title=2006 BMW 3 Series: The Benchmark Settles Into Comfortable Middle Age|last=MAYERSOHN|first=NORMAN|date=2009-06-24|pages=2|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> The record selling year for the E46 chassis was 2002, when 561,249 vehicles were sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/01/27/178201.html | publisher=The Auto Channel | accessdate=2006-07-24 | title=Successful 2003 Financial Year for the BMW Group}}</ref>

[[BMW M GmbH]] produced a high performance variant of the E46 chassis, designated the [[BMW M3#E46 M3|M3]]. This version had a larger, more powerful engine, sportier suspension, a [[limited slip differential]], and various aesthetic modifications. The M3 was released in 2001 and was available only in the coupé and convertible body style. It was offered with two transmissions; a standard 6-speed manual, or an optional [[sequential manual gearbox]].

==Design==
=== Exterior design ===
The E46 was developed as a modern replacement for the aging BMW E36 chassis. DesignWorksUSA was contracted by BMW to work alongside BMW Group's in house design team to create the exterior body work.<ref name="designworksusa">{{cite web|url=http://www.designworksusa.com/design/carsbikes/BMW3Series/index.html|title=DesignworksUSA|publisher=BMW Group|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> Based on the E36 body shell, the design team put an emphasis on improving aerodynamics and increasing the cars aggressive stance.<ref name="designworksusa" />

=== Powertrain and engine design ===
An emphasis was put on reducing [[unsprung weight]] and structural rigidity rather than increasing power output: the highest displacement model at release, the E46 328, had only 3 horsepower more than the E36 328.<ref name="edmunds3" /> To counter this small power increase, the body shell of the E46 was claimed by BMW to be 70% more rigid than the E36's,<ref name="edmunds3" /> and aluminum suspension components were used increasingly in order to decrease unsprung weight.<ref name="edmunds3" /> In tune with BMW's core values<ref name="rearwheelfrontengine50/50">{{cite web|url=http://www.bmw.co.za/innovations/weight/overview.asp|title=BMW Innovations Lounge|publisher=BMW|pages=1|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref>, the E46 was released with a [[front engine]]d [[rear-wheel drive]] layout with 50/50 weight distribution.<ref name="edmunds3">{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=66153|title=BMW 3 Series|date=2003-08-01|publisher=Edmunds|pages=1|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref><ref name="general specs">{{cite web|url=http://www.reveuro.com/buyers_guide/bmw/3series/e46.html|title=BMW E46 3 series buyers guide specs features|publisher=reveuro|pages=1|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> This balance allows for optimal handling in regards to the drive train layout.

===323===
The 323 was one of the first E46 models available for purchase, 1998 for the sedan (excluding North American markets) and 1999 for the coupe (and sedan in North American markets). Although the model was named the 323, it obtained BMW's 2.5l [[BMW M52#M52TUB25|M52]] engine designated M52TUB25.<ref name="4cyl2" /> The M52 engine was used in E36 applications, however this 2.5l version obtained dual [[VANOS]], BMW's mechanically continuous variable valve timing system. This improved low end torque and fuel economy over the M52B25 used in the E36 323. The 323 had its last model year in 2000<ref name="4cyl2" />, where it was then retired to make way for the updated E46 325.

===328===
The 328 was released alongside the 323 as a higher displacement version, still using the [[BMW M52#M52TUB28|BMW M52]] engine.

==Trim levels==
===United States market===
====Premium package (ZPP)====
The premium package has been available on all 3-series cars. It typically included: 

Different wheels/tires [if ordered with the sport package, the sport package wheels/tires superseed] 
A multifunction steering wheel [IF it was not already standard on the vehicle] 
Wood grain interior trim [if ordered with the sport package, the premium package wood is typically installed, unless specifically requested otherwise] 
Rain-sensing windshield wipers (became standard equipment in 2004) 
Auto-dimming rear-view mirror 
Power seats 
Lumbar Support (not available on the 325) 
Moonroof (note: moonroof can also be ordered separately)

====Sports package (ZSP)====
The sports package was available on all E46's, excluding cars with the Performance package and the M3. It consisted of a three spoke sports leather steering wheel and had improved grip over the standard "square" steering wheel. The car was also given sports seats which provided better bolstering and support than the stock seats. They also had adjustable thigh supports and were available in manual or power. The sports package also offered 17 inch wheels standard, which came with staggered lower profile tires. Sports suspension was also given, which offered improved handling by way of firmer springs, a lower ride height, and tighter dampers.

====Cold weather package (ZCW)====
The cold weather package has been available on all 3-series and M3 cars. It typically included: 

*Pass-through ski bag 
*Heated seats 
*Headlight washers 
*Fold down rear seats

====Performance package (ZHP)====
[[Image:2005 BMW 330Ci ZHP Silver.jpg|thumb|right|2005 BMW 330Ci ZHP]]
The performance package was an option given to E46 sedans from 2003 to 2005 and coupes from 2004-2006.<ref name="330zhp1" /> It included various aesthetic changes over the regular 3 series, as well as performance enhancements. It received the "M-Tech II" bodykit standard, 18-inch [[Glossary_of_automotive_design#S|staggered]] Style 135 wheels, high gloss anthracite window trim, and the coupe received clear turn signals (headlights, side-markers, and tail-lights) instead of the amber turn signals found on the standard 330Ci.<ref name="330zhp1" /> The interior had also been modified with half cloth-half alcantara sports seats (optional upgrade to leather), an alcantara-wrapped sports steering wheel (switched to perforated leather in mid-2005), a shorter shift knob, anthracite colored cloth headliner, and aluminum "cubed" interior trim (available in silver or black). The instrument gauge cluster was also modified with red needles.<ref name="ZHP2" />

In the performance department, the ZHP was equipped with the more aggressive BMW Performance camshafts and a [[DME]] tune to increase power from {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|235|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}<ref name="330zhp1">{{cite web|url=http://www.brazeauracing.com/330i/index.html|title=BMW 330i ZHP|publisher=Brazeau Racing|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref>. The engine redline was also raised from 6,500RPM to 6,800RPM to further take advantage of the new power band and higher power output achieved by the new camshafts at higher RPMs..<ref name="ZHP2">{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/entry_luxury/bmw_330i_with_performance_package_road_test/%28page%29/1|title=BMW 330i with Performance Package|publisher=Car and Driver|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> As a result of the higher redline, the nut that fastens the oil pump's sprocket came with threadlocker pre-applied from the factory to keep the nut from falling off; this was done to fix what is a common problem with all M54 engines that are regularly revved high.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://forum.e46fanatics.com/showthread.php?t=714263 | publisher=E46fanatics citing BMWNA | accessdate=2009-10-29 | title=ZHP specific OPN (Oil Pump Nut)}}</ref>. The car also received a shorter final drive ratio which allows for faster acceleration; 3.07 vs. 2.93 for manuals and 3.64 vs. 3.38 for the automatic.<ref name="ZHP2"/> 
''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine track-tested the car, which returned a 0-60 [[miles per hour|mph]] time of 5.6 seconds and passed through the 1/4 mile in 14.3 seconds.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.caranddriver.com/layout/set/print/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/entry_luxury/bmw_330ci_and_330xi_first_drive_review | publisher=Car & Driver | accessdate=2008-01-31 | title=BMW 330i with Performance Package - Road Test}}</ref> In 2003 the ZHP was the only 330i to come with a 6-speed manual transmission, and the Steptronic automatic transmission was not available in this first year (2003), but it was offered from 2004-2006.

Suspension was modified over the standard suspension with firmer springs and dampers, larger anti-roll bars, stronger front control arm ball joints, a lower ride height, and slightly more negative camber.<ref name="ZHP2"/>. The Style 135 wheels also came equipped with the much stickier compound, Michelin Pilot Sport tires, in a staggered configuration with 225/40-18 tires in the front and 255/35-18 tires in the back. <ref name="ZHP2"/>

===Rest of world markets===
====ES====
The ES trim level was the base level available for the European E46s. It included various safety features as standard equipment, such as [[anti-lock brakes]], 6 airbags, [[dynamic stability control]], and a factory installed alarm which were not common as standard features when the E46 was released.<ref name="eurotrim" /> Comfort items such as heated and electric mirrors were also fitted standard.<ref name="eurotrim" />  The ES trim did not include a leather interior standard, it was offered as an "at-cost" option.<ref name="eurotrim">{{cite web|url=http://www.parkers.co.uk/cars/reviews/bmw/3-series-coupe-1999.aspx?page=7|title=BMW 3 series coupe car review|publisher=parkers.co.uk|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref>

====SE====
The SE trim level included the options the ES trim level was given, but added [[cruise control]], electric adjustable front seats, headlight washers, parking sensors, and a full leather interior as standard.<ref name="eurotrim" /> It was the mid-range trim level that offered luxury items, but lacked the performance items the M Sport and M Clubsport trim levels had.

====M Sport====
The M Sport trim level included the options given on the ES and SE trim levels, but had additional performance-orientated items added. It came with the "M-tech" I or II bodykits (depending on when the car was ordered), half leather-half [[alcantara]] sports seats, sports suspension, and 17" lightweight style 68 wheels.<ref name="eurotrim" />

====M Clubsport====
[[File:BMW E46FL Sport.JPG|thumb|A 330Ci M Clubsport]]
The M Clubsport trim level is aesthetically similar to the United States Performance Package.<ref name="eurotrim" /> The main difference is that the M Clubsport trim was not given the BMW performance camshafts that the ZHP obtained. Instead, it had {{convert|20|kg|lb}} of sound deadening removed from the car. The M Clubsport trim shares the same suspension set up as the performance package (ZHP) in America, as well as the "cubed" interior trim and 18 inch style 135 wheels.<ref name="clubsport">{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/evocarreviews/28052/bmw_3series.html|title=Clubsport review|publisher=EVO magazine|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> However, changes from the ZHP include plastic front splitters on the M-Tech II bumper, a M-tech II styled rear spoiler (instead of the M3 trunk lip), and clubsport door sills.<ref name="clubsport" /> The M Clubsport also came with two "BMW Individual" colour options that were carried throughout the car, Estoril Blue and Velvet Blue.<ref name="clubsport" />

Unlike the other trim levels, the M Clubsport trim was only available on the 330.<ref name="eurotrim" />

====Luxury package====
This Canadian-only package offered the same options as the United States premium package.

==Model nomenclature==
==="i"===
The "i" badging indicates that the car has a fuel injection engine (Petrol) which first appeared in the E21 & E30 models.

===="xi"====
With the introduction of the xi models in 2001, BMW brought back AWD which hadn't been an option in the 3-series since 1991 when the E30 325iX was discontinued. BMW produced the 325xi and 330xi in the US between 2001-2005, but only in Sedan (4-door) trim.

The AWD models were well received by reviewers for giving customers in severe winter climates the option of an AWD 3-series. At the same time, the xi was criticized for its added weight, slower acceleration, decreased gas mileage, softer suspension, and poor original equipment tires. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.caranddriver.com/layout/set/print/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/entry_luxury/bmw_330ci_and_330xi_first_drive_review | publisher=Car & Driver | accessdate=2008-01-31 | title=BMW 330Ci and 330xi - First Drive Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.caranddriver.com/layout/set/print/reviews/comparison_test/sedans/bmw_330xi_vs_subaru_impreza_wrx_audi_s4_comparison_test | publisher=Car & Driver | accessdate=2008-01-31 | title=BMW 330xi vs. Subaru Impreza WRX, Audi S4}}</ref>

The transfer case used in all BMW E46 xi models is manufactured by New Venture Gear, Inc., which is owned by Magna Powertrain. The NV 124 transfer case used in the E46 xi models is a full-time four-wheel-drive gear driven transfer case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xiftw.com/?page_id=16 |title=The xi resource. » Transfer Case |publisher=XI FTW |date= |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref>

The xi models have a permanent front/rear 38:62 torque split which differs from the E46's successor, the [[BMW E90|E9X]], which incorporated BMW's new [[BMW xDrive|xDrive]] platform. Both the front and rear differentials in the E46 xi are open differentials which are aided by DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) to control wheel spin and oversteer/understeer.

===="d"====
The "d" indicates that the car is a sedan with a diesel powered engine.

==="Ci"===
The "Ci" indicates that the car is a coupe with a petrol powered engine.

===="Cd"====
The "Cd" indicates that the car is a coupe with a diesel powered engine.

==="Cic"===
The "Cic" indicates that the car is a 2 door convertible with a petrol powered engine
==="iT"===
The "T" in the "iT" badge stands for "Touring", the BMW nomenclature for a 4 door wagon. It has a petrol powered engine.

==="ti" (Compact)===

==E46 M3==
===E46 M3 CSL===
[[File:M3-csl.jpg|thumb|A silver BMW M3 CSL.]]
The BMW M3 CSL (coupe sports lightweight)<ref name="coupesportslightweight">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.automobilemag.com/6291366/car-news/bmw-cancels-lightweight-m3-csl/index.html|title=BMW Cancels Lightweight M3 CSL|publisher=Automobile Mag|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> was a limited edition version of the M3, with only 1,400 cars being produced for its 2004 model year run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/tag/bmw+m3+csl/|title=BMW M3 CSL|publisher=Autoblog|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> The CSL was never released into the North American market,<ref name="CSLperformance" /> and was only available in two colours - Silver Grey Metallic and Black Sapphire Metallic. <ref name="usautoparts" />

As its name suggests, an emphasis was put on reducing weight. The M3 CSL has a kerb weight of {{convert|1385|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|110|kg|lb|abbr=on}} lighter than the regular M3.<ref name="cartorque">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartorque.co.za/0001.htm|title=BMW M3 CSL|publisher=Cartorque|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref><ref name="diseno">{{cite web|url=http://www.diseno-art.com/encyclopedia/vehicles/road/cars/bmw_m3_csl.html|title=BMW M3 CSL (E46)|publisher=diseno-art|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref><ref name="CSLreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.carenthusiast.com/reviews.html?mode=article&id=855|title=Car reviews - BMW M3 CSL|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> The CSL features many weight saving technologies taken from [[Formula One]] racing applications.<ref name="carpages">{{cite web|url=Glass-reinforced plastic|title=The New M3 CSL|date=Car pages|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> A large proportion of the M3's sound insulation has been removed, as have the power windows, electric seats, and navigation systems.<ref name="CSLperformance" />. Air conditioning and stereo systems could be retrofitted free of cost, but were not available standard.<ref name="diseno" /> The CSL's unique body pieces are all crafted from [[carbon fiber reinforced polymer]].<ref name="cartorque" /> [[Glass-reinforced plastic]]s are used throughout structural points in the car.<ref name="diseno" /> The rear glass window was replaced with lightweight plastic.<ref name="diseno"/> Although the CSL loses a considerable amount of kerb weight from its original version, the focus was put on strategically reducing or moving the weight in the car rather than the raw amount of weight that could be lost.<ref name="automag">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/coupes/0210_bmw_m3_csl/index.html|title=BMW M3 CSL|publisher=Automobile magazine|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> This is to retain the ideal 50:50 weight distribution characteristics the E46 has.<ref name="cartorque" /> For example, the roof is constructed from carbon fiber reinforced plastic.<ref name="cartorque" /> While this only reduces the kerb weight of the car by {{convert|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, it lowers the center of gravity of the car and decreases body flex.<ref name="usautoparts" /><ref name="automag" />
[[File:Black BMW M3 CSL E46 rr.jpg|thumb|A black M3 E46 CSL.|left]]
In order to improve the handling ability of the car, the entire suspension system was further refined.<ref name="cartorque" /> Specially developed racing springs and [[Shock absorber|dampers]] are given to the CSL, and a tightened steering ratio (14.5:1 vs 15.4:1 on the regular M3) improves responsiveness.<ref name="carpages" /> The braking system is also modified, with larger front  and rear floating rotors and [[Disc_brake#Calipers|calipers]] from the [[BMW_M5#E39_M5_.281998.E2.80.932003.29|E39 M5]].<ref name="CSLperformance">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/coupes/0210_bmw_m3_csl/performance.html|title=BMW M3 CSL Performance|publisher=Automobile Magazine|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref><ref name="usautoparts">{{cite web|url=http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/models/m3_csl.htm|title=BMW M3 Parts CSL|publisher=US auto parts|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> The CSL is given a retuned dymanic stability control system with a "M track mode" setting that allows the car to be pushed to its absolute limits before being activated.<ref name="carpages" />

The 3.2l engine used in the M3, the [[BMW M50#S54B32|BMW S54]], has been modified to increased output by {{convert|17|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5|Nm|lb-f|0|abbr=on}} over the European M3.<ref name="usautoparts" /><ref name="carpages" /> This is achieved through a high flow carbon fiber air intake, modified valve and camshaft timing, and a retuned DME.<ref name="usautoparts" /><ref name="carpages" /> However, the engine is further modified in order to reduce weight - it features a lightweight exhaust manifold and thinner exhaust piping.<ref name="carpages" /> Additionally, the intake and exhaust manifolds are slightly straightened to improve engine responsiveness.<ref name="CSLperformance" />

The CSL also has various aesthetic modifications over the standard M3. It received an aerodynamic lightweight body kit which included carbon fiber front splitters that improved downforce at high speeds by 50%,<ref name="cartorque" /> as well as a carbon fiber rear diffuser. The front bumper has a distinct hole that is used to draw cool air into the newly designed air intake.<ref name="cartorque" /> The boot lid is redesigned to incorporate a raised lip, unlike the standard M3 where one is simply added on to a flat boot.<ref name="cartorque" /> The CSL was sold with distinct 19 inch lightweight forged BBS alloy rims that came with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup [[Tire#High_performance|semi-slick]] racing tires.<ref name="usautoparts" /><ref name="tirecite">{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/buying_guide/bmw/m3/bmw_m3_csl_auto_shows__1+type-news_by_make+mode-collection+id-259.html|title=BMW M3 CSL - Auto Shows|publisher=Car and driver|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> The interior of the CSL is redesigned with a sporty-weight saving theme. The CSL obtains fiberglass front racing bucket seats,<ref name="cartorque" /> and fiberglass backed rear seats.<ref name="cartorque" /> The center console, door panels and trim, and headliner are all formed from carbon fiber<ref name="usautoparts" /><ref name="cartorque" />, and the steering wheel is redesigned with cruise control, stereo, and phone controls removed to include just a single button that activates the M track mode.<ref name="usautoparts" />

Unlike the standard M3, which was offered with a standard 6-speed GETRAG transmission, or optionally a [[SMG]] drivelogic transmission (also known as the SMG II), the CSL was offered only with the SMG II transmission.<ref name="carpages" /> This is the standard 6-speed GETRAG transmission with an electrohydraulically actuated clutch pedal, similar to an Formula One style transmission.<ref name="usautoparts" /> However, the CSL received a more advanced drivelogic unit than the standard M3 that was capable of making shifts in 0.08 of a second.<ref name="usautoparts" /><ref name="carpages" />

===North American competition package (ZCP)===
As the M3 CSL was not available to the North American markets, BMW released an optional "competition package" (option code ZCP) to fill the market void. It upgraded the normal M3 by way of 19 inch cast lightweight CSL style wheels, detuned CSL suspension components, a tighter steering ratio, and the CSLs brakes.<ref name="M3Zine">{{cite web|url=http://www.m3zine.com/index.php/E46-M3.html|title=BMW M3 Zine - BMW M3|publisher=M3Zine|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> It also included a detuned version of the CSLs dynamic stability control.<ref name="M3Zine" />
