The '''Smart Forfour''' was a [[supermini car|supermini]] that was produced by [[Smart (automobile)|Smart]] between April 2004 and June 2006. Unlike the other models of the marque, the Forfour was a more conventional five-door [[hatchback]] with a relatively roomy interior, available as a four- / five-seater.

The car was produced at the [[NedCar]] factory in the [[Netherlands]] in conjunction with [[Mitsubishi Motors]]. This is the same factory that produced [[Volvo 300 Series|Volvo 300]] cars in 1970s and 1980s and the Volvo V40s in the 1990s. To save production costs, the '''Smart Forfour''' shares most of its components with the 2003 [[Mitsubishi Colt]]. This includes the chassis, suspension and a new generation of [[MIVEC]] [[petrol engine]]s, ranging from the three cylinder {{convert|1.1|L|in3|0|abbr=on}} to the four cylinder {{convert|1.3|L|in3|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1.5|L|in3|0|abbr=on}} engines with power up to {{convert|80|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|1.5|L|in3|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[common rail|common direct injection]] (cdi) [[diesel engine]], on the contrary, is a three-cylinder [[Mercedes-Benz]] engine derived from the four-cylinder used in the [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class]], and is available with either {{convert|68|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|95|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.

A [[Brabus]]-prepared sports version has been available since 2005. It is powered by a turbocharged [[Mitsubishi 4G1x engine#4G15|Mitsubishi 4G15]] engine, developing {{convert|130|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|27|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} more than the Mitsubishi Colt CZT. It can reach a maximum speed of {{convert|221|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and accelerate from zero to {{convert|100|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on}} in 6.9 seconds. The Forfour was to be sold in the United States along with the revived [[Smart Formore]] vehicle.<ref>[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/smart-car.htm How the Smart Car Works]</ref> However, due to slow sales, the Forfour has been phased out from production. <ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/02/smart-forfour-production-ends-mitsubishi-and-daimlerchrysler-p/ SMART forfour production ends - Mitsubishi and DaimlerChrysler part ways]</ref>

The sales brochures state that the interior "is designed around the concept of a lounge"; to test this, [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]] presenters spent 24 hours inside the Forfour. They said it was a nice place to be in but they would not buy the car due to its high price compared to its rivals.

Following Smart's success launching the fortwo in the US, and due to a surprise increase in popularity in the forfour, Mercedes-Benz exec Rainer Schmückle recently revealed that officials were considering relaunching the car.<ref>[http://www.motorauthority.com/news/hatchbacks/comeback-planned-for-smart-forfour/ Motor Authority » Comeback planned for Smart ForFour<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Electric version ==
A Smart forFour has been converted into a [[plug-in hybrid]] by [[Lithium Technology Corporation]] and [[Zytek]] Systems. The [[lithium-ion battery]] can propel the vehicle up to {{Convert|84|mph|abbr=on}} and last on its own for up to {{Convert|20|mi|km}}. The engine is a combination of a {{convert|68|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}, {{convert|1.5|L|in3|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}, three-cylinder [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] diesel engine and two high-efficiency [[permanent-magnet electric motor]]s. It received an award from the [[Energy Saving Trust]] for the “Ultra Low Carbon Car Challenge” project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetell.com/tech/comment/a-plug-in-hybrid-that-can-go-84/ |title=A plug-in Hybrid that can go 84 |publisher=Gadgetell.com |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref>
