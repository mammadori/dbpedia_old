The '''Opel Frogster''' was a 2001 [[concept car]] created by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors']] German brand, [[Opel]]. The Frogster could be transformed from a [[convertible]] to a [[roadster]] or a [[pickup truck]] by using a built-in [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] mounted between the two front seats. The Frogster was mainly targeted towards younger buyers. There are no plans for the Frogster to go into production.

==Technology==
The Opel Frogster boasted a lot of new technology not yet used by any production automobile. It featured a PDA between the two front seats that could be used to control most of the functions of the car. It is also unusual in that it could literally transform the car into three different body styles.

==Heritage==
The Opel Frogster was named from an early [[Opel]] model from the 1920s called the "Laubfrosch". The Laubfrosch was nicknamed the "Tree Frog" by the younger crowd because of its bright green color. When [[Opel]] designers were thinking of creating a new concept car, they were excited by the new [[Opel Speedster]]. While thinking of creating the look of the new [[concept car]], someone called out to paint it green and call it the Frogster.
