The '''Volkswagen Gol''' is a [[low cost]] [[subcompact car]] designed in [[Brazil]] and sold by [[Germany|German]] automaker [[Volkswagen]] since 1980. It is Volkswagen's entry-level car in the [[South America]]n market, beneath the other superminis, the [[Volkswagen Fox|Fox]] and [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]]. It has uninterruptedly been the best-selling car in Brazil since 1987, and since 1998 in [[Argentina]]. Gol sales in South America are also high; over 5 million Gols have been produced since 1980. Gol has also been produced in Iran under the same name.
Its project was started in 2nd half of 1970's due the need for a liable successor for the [[VW Beetle]] (Fusca, in Brazil), since the European cars would not be liable for sales due the road conditions (that required more resistant platforms) and different customer needs.

The Gol takes its name from the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for "[[goal (sport)|goal]]."

==Body styles==
The Gol family comprises many body styles:
*A 3 and 5 door [[hatchback]] which takes the name '''VW Gol''' in most countries; in Mexico, Egypt and Russia it has been called the '''VW Pointer'''. The first-generation Gol was offered only as a three-door; a five-door version was added in 1997.
*A [[sedan (car)|sedan]] produced only for the Gol I. The Brazilian-built two-door and four-doors sedans were called the '''VW Voyage''' and Argentinian-built ones '''VW Gacel'''; the nameplate '''VW Fox''' was used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. After a facelift in 1991, Argentinian-built models were renamed the '''VW Senda'''. For the second generation this model was replaced by the [[Volkswagen Polo|Volkswagen Polo Mk 3 Classic]], which is still sold in Mexico and Argentina. But a new '''Voyage''' notchback sedan returned in the G5 generation.
*'''VW Parati''', a [[station wagon]] built on both generations since May 1982. The Parati I was a three-door sold in [[North America]] as the '''Fox Wagon'''. The second-generation Parati is sold in Argentina as the '''Gol Country'''. A five-door version was added in 1997 and the three-door version was dropped after the first facelift. It is named after [[Paraty]], a city on the southern coast of Rio de Janeiro state. It was formerly called '''Pointer Station Wagon''' in Mexico and it was sold there between 1999 and 2005. It is rumored this model will be discontinued for the G5 generation.
*'''VW Saveiro''', a lightweight [[pickup truck]]. All Gol generations have been sold with this body, and was introduced to the market in September 1984. It is named after a traditional Brazilian fishing boat. It is currently sold in Mexico since 1999 as the '''Pointer Pick Up'''.
*'''VW Furgão''', a lightweight [[panel van]] based on the Gol.

The Gol was released in 1980 to replace the [[Volkswagen Brasilia|Brasilia]], which was in turn a replacement to the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] in the Brazilian market. It was based on its own unique [[Volkswagen B platform#BX|BX]] [[automobile platform]] derived from the existing VW/Audi B1 and B2 platforms. With a design specific to [[Latin America]], the Gol featured the 1.3-liter air-cooled, [[flat-4|H4]] engine from the Beetle, but [[front-engine design|front-mounted]]. A 1.6-litre engine was added later. In the mid 1980s, this engine was replaced by 1.6 and 1.8-litre longitudinally-mounted water-cooled gasoline [[Straight-4|I4]] engines from the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]]. A 1.6-litre Diesel engine was made only for export (Diesel engines are not allowed in cars in Brazil).

The first generation (or "G1") Gol had two mild facelifts in 1987 and 1991. The 1988 '''Gol GTi''' was the first Brazilian-built car to use [[fuel injection]]. The 2.0-liter [[Straight-4|I4]] engine was the same used by the [[Volkswagen Santana|Santana]].

=== Sports versions ===
{{Cleanup|date=February 2007}}
*'''GT 1.8 (1984-86)'''

The Gol GT 1.8 was the BX family's first sports version and an answer to the Ford Escort XR3, a successful sports car in Brazilian market. With a 1.8 liter engine borrowed from Santana (MkII Passat), the Gol GT was much faster than the Escort XR3, but externally didn't have the same beauty. First series still had a 4-speed gearbox, soon changed to a 5-speed (both [[Manual transmission|manual]]).
*'''GTS 1.8 (1987-1994)'''

Successor of Gol GT, the GTS had an updated design, following the new 87 BX line up style and also featuring new accessories that were not available before, such as rear spoiler and side skirts. The 1.8 liter engine produced 94&nbsp;hp running on gasoline or 99&nbsp;hp running on ethanol. The GTS was a very successful model and was kept in production alongside with the upcoming GTI.
*'''GTI 2000 (1989-1994)'''

Known as the first Brazilian built car equipped with electronic fuel injection, the Gol GTI featured a larger 2.0 liter engine with power of 120&nbsp;bhp running on gasoline. Also this engine was borrowed from Santana, despite that this model still used carburettors.

The second generation (or "G2") Gol, known as ''Project AB9'' during development, debuted in September 1994. Still based on the BX platform, it was very different from the earlier model, with an updated body and longer wheelbase than the 1980 original. Nicknamed "Gol Bolinha" (roughly "Rounded Gol" or "Bubble Gol"), and the previous started to be nicknamed as "Gol Quadrado", "Squared Gol". The new version was an answer to the then newly released [[Chevrolet Corsa]].

===G3 and G4 facelifts===
The second-generation Gol received two facelifts, which include both cosmetic and engine upgrades.

The first upgrade, in 1999, was known as the Gol G3 (right photo) in Brazil and had a new VW 'corporate' front end similar to the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta/Bora IV]]. The Gol G3 came with optional airbags and ABS brakes.

When the 2005 (G4) Gol was released with styling cues from the [[Volkswagen Fox]], incorporating the "V Grill", most avid automotive enthusiasts were unimpressed with the leap backwards in interior design.{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Gol Turbo and Total Flex===

The '''Gol 1.0 16V Turbo''' "[[hot hatch]]", launched in 2000 with a 112&nbsp;hp 1.0-litre [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] gasoline engine, was the first one of its kind in [[South America]], as was the [[flexible fuel vehicle]] '''Gol Total Flex''', available since 2003.

===Pointer (Mexico)===
The Gol G2 was introduced in [[Mexico]] in spring 1998 as the '''Volkswagen Pointer''' (a name previously used in Latin America for a rebadged model based on the [[Ford Escort]]). The only version for this year was a 3 door hatchback with a 1.8lt 98&nbsp;hp engine and a 5 speed manual gearbox. The only extra cost option available was a package compounding air conditioning and power steering. For 1999 a 5 door hatchback version, the Brazilian '''Parati''' (called the Pointer Station Wagon in Mexico) and the '''Saveiro''' (called the Pointer Pick Up) are added. They were marketed in three trim levels: Base, Comfort (A/C and power steering) and Luxe (14" alloy wheels, power windows and remote control centralized door locks, A/C and power steering). For 2000 the Pointer received the same facelift as in Brazil and a sporty '''Pointer GTI''' based on the Brazilian '''Gol GTI''' is introduced. It was a 3 door hatchback with a 2.0lt 122&nbsp;hp engine. It had AM/FM/Cassette radio, alloy wheels, 4 disc brakes, sport black seats as standard equipment. In 2002 a basic '''Pointer City''' version is introduced, the former Comfort version is renamed the Trendline, and the Luxe variant as the Comfortline. In 2005 the Pointer Station Wagon and the '''Pointer GTI''' are discontinued and the former Pointer trims (but the City) are replaced by a new '''Pointer Mi''' version.

In the model year 2007, the Pointer receives the newest facelift, and its versions are reorganized. The Pointer is currently marketed as the Base, A/C (Air Conditioning, power steering and rear wiper/washer), Trendline (Radio AM/FM Stereo CD, 15" alloy wheels, fog lamps), and GT (only available as a 5 door hatchback. It has the same equipment as the Trendline plus: rear headrests, 6 spoke 15" alloy wheels, black accented headlamps, rear spoiler, and sport seats). The '''Pointer''' was replaced in December 2008 by the new '''Volkswagen Gol''' G5 which has been launched in Brazil in July 2008.

===Gol around the world===

* As a result of a joint-venture with [[Kerman Khodro]], the Gol has been built in [[Iran]] since 2003.
 
* The Gol G3 was briefly sold in [[Russia]] in 2005 as the Pointer, but the sales were soon discontinued due to low demand.

* The Gol G3 was also made and sold by [[Volkswagen Group China|Shanghai Volkswagen]] in [[China]]. (Stopped now){{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

* It is currently sold in [[Egypt]] as the [[Volkswagen Pointer]].

The fifth generation of the Gol was released in Brazil, on June 29, 2008, as a 2009 model. Referred to before its launch as the ''Gol NF'' for ''Nachfolger'' or ''Neue Familie'' (German terms for "successor" and "new family" respectively), this model is marketed as the "Novo Gol". No longer based on the BX platform, it shares Volkswagen's [[Volkswagen Group A0 platform#PQ24|PQ24]] platform with the [[Volkswagen Fox|Fox]] and [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], with some components from the [[Volkswagen Group A0 platform#PQ25|PQ25]] platform.<ref>{{cite web

===Future Gol plans and rumours===
{{Refimprovesect|date=October 2008}}

The new model may be sold in [[Eastern Europe]] as a [[Škoda Auto]] model to compete with the [[Dacia Logan]] and future low cost [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] entries. The NF acronym translates as "New Family" in many languages. e.g. ''Nova Família'' in Portuguese, ''Nueva Familia'' in Spanish, ''Nuova Famiglia'' in Italian, ''Nouvelle Famille'' in French, and ''Neue Familie'' in German.

Besides the five-door hatchback, pickup versions and [[sedan (car)|sedan]] a station wagon and [[panel van]] could be added to the range to replace the Parati and [[Volkswagen Caddy|Caddy Type 9K]].

A [[Turbocharged]] version of the Gol G5, with a 1.4L TSI engine is rumored to be released on 2010 under the name of Gol GTI 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auto-car-shop.com/2009/05/volkswagen-gol-gti-2010-confirmed-and-fox-2010/ |title=Volkswagen Gol GTI 2010 (confirmed) and Fox 2010 : All automotive car reviews blog |publisher=Auto-car-shop.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref>

==Voyage/Senda/Gacel==
The Voyage 2-door sedan variant of the Gol was released in June 1981 with a 1.5 inline watercooled gasoline engine. The same engine was offered with an ethanol option.

By May 1982 the 1.5 were upgraded to 1.6. In 1984 a watercooled 1.8 was launched as a higher level option.

In January 1983 the four-door sedan was released. It was known as VW Amazon in some export markets, with diesel engines.

Between 1991 and 1995 the Ford CHT 1.6 was in the range as part of the [[Autolatina]] lineup.

The four-door Voyage/Senda/Gacel was built in the Autolatina [[General Pacheco|Pacheco]] factory in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina from 1983 to 1994. It was sold under the name '''Gacel''' with the Argentine-built 1.6 OHC engine with a carburettor.

The new 2008 Voyage was release in Brazil in October 2008, a few months after the Gol G5.

== Fox / Fox Wagon (United States & Canada, 1987-1993)==
[[Image:1st-Volkswagen-Jetta-Sedan.jpg|250px|thumb|right|1987-1990 Volkswagen Fox sedan]]
[[Image:Volkswagen-Fox-GL-sedan.jpg|250px|thumb|right|1991-93 US-spec Volkswagen Fox GL sedan]]The [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and [[station wagon]] versions were sold in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as the '''Fox''' and '''Fox Wagon''' between 1987 and 1993 as an entry-level model. The styling changed slightly in 1991, with different grilles, headlights, turn signals etc. Badges also were changed slightly, and the interior was updated. Other differences included such things as two towing hooks instead of four, and a different style of hubcaps for the two of them.

Compared with the rest of the Volkswagen lineup of the time, the Fox was very similar and very different at the same time. Its suspension was indeed Fox-specific, but as noted before it shared a transmission and longitudinal engine orientation with the [[Volkswagen Quantum|Quantum]] and Audi 80/4000 B2 platform, took its engine from the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]]/[[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]], and used the same generic wheels from other models in the lineup.

The only engine offered was a longitudinally-mounted [[straight-4]] 1.8&nbsp;L [[gasoline engine]]. The same engine could have been found in the Jetta and Golf of the time, but the Fox variation was heavily restricted compared to the other models. The engine produced 81&nbsp;hp @ 5500&nbsp;rpm and 93&nbsp;ft·lbf at @3250&nbsp;rpm. In North America, three different variations of the engine were available. In Canada, the UM model came with CIS fuel injection, no catalytic converter, and no oxygen sensor. By comparison, the US version had CIS-E fuel injection along with the catalytic converter and oxygen sensor. The third variation was on the 1991-93 models, which had a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] Digifant II system which stored error codes, and had a 6000&nbsp;rpm limiter. However, unlike Golfs and Jettas of the same time, all of the North American models did not have a knock sensor or a wide open throttle (WOT) switch.

The different versions were the Fox, Fox GL, Fox GTS, Fox GLS, Fox GL Sport, Fox Polo, and Fox Wolfsburg. Fox options included air conditioning, GL trim (with special cloth seats, map light, glove compartment light, trunk light, tachometer, painted bumpers, etc.), five-speed manual transmission and metallic paint.
