Subsequent to the type 247 motor, BMW also built other air-cooled flat twin engines known as the Typ 248/1 used for the R45, the [[BMW R65|R65]] and the [[BMW R65|R65LS]] BMW motorcycles. Before that they built [[Flathead engine|side-valve]] and [[Overhead valve|OHV]] engines commencing with the R32 of 1923. After the type 247, BMW substantially changed the engine design to include partial [[oil cooling]] and four valves per cylinder, a design which was to become known as the "[[oilhead]]".
