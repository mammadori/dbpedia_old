'''Louis Marie Turreau''' (4 July 1756, [[Évreux]], [[Eure]] - 10 December 1816, [[Conches]]), also known as ''Turreau de Garambouville'' or ''Turreau de Linières'', was a French general of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].

He was most notable as the organisor of the [[colonnes infernales]] during the [[war in the Vendée]], which massacred tens of thousands of Vendéens and ravaged the countryside.  He then pursued a career as a high functionary, becoming ambassador to the United States then a [[baron d'Empire]].

==Life==
=== Early life ===
Louis-Marie Turreau's father was fiscal procurator for waters and forests to the [[comté d'Évreux]], before becoming mayor of [[Évreux]]. This situation imparted certain privileges to the Turreau family, even though they were not nobles.  Turreau was nevertheless a fervent revolutionary from 1789, profiting like many others, especially the bourgeois of that era. Elected mayor of [[Aviron]], he bought several clerical estates (such as that of the [[abbaye de Conches]]).

===Career to 1794===
Before the Revolution, he had not had any real military activity, having entered the guards corps of the comte d’Artois but only been inscribed for supernumerary roles (he was only a reservist).  On the Revolution, he entered the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] of [[Conches]], and took over as its leader in July 1792. In September he was elected captain of a company of volunteers from [[Eure]] and set out to fight on the northern frontiers.  Made a colonel in November, he was integrated into the [[armée de Moselle]].

In June 1793, he was brought into the [[armée des côtes de La Rochelle]], remaining so until 8 October, though this post did not please him - he wrote to a friend "I would move heaven and earth not to go to [[Poitou]].  This kind of war displeases me."  Even so, he fought for two months in the [[Vendée]].  He was then named head of the [[armée des Pyrénées orientales]] until 27 November, before being moved again to the army in the west, as commander in chief of the [[armée de l'Ouest]] from 29 December, but he again regarded this post with little enthusiasm.  At the time he arrived in post the last elements of the [[Armée catholique et royale]] were erased by [[Jean-Baptiste Kléber|Kléber]] and  [[François Séverin Marceau|Marceau]] at [[battle of Savenay|Savenay]] on 23 December.

=== The colonnes infernales ===

=== Later career ===

On 20 May Turreau was named governor of [[Belle-Île-en-Mer|Belle-Île]], then arrested on 28 September.  He spent a year in prison, which he used to edit his ''Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire de la Vendée''.  He refused the amnesty of [[26 October|4 brumaire]] [[1795|year IV]] which closed the works of the [[National Convention]], aiming to be unequivocally rehabilitated.  On 19 December 1795 he was acquitted by a military tribunal which judged he had only been obeying orders.  Under the [[French Consulate]] he was sent as an envoy to Switzerland.  From 1803 to 1811 he was French ambassador to the [[United States of America]], then commander of several military strongholds.

In 1814, he submitted to [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and during the [[Hundred Days]] published a ''Mémoire contre le retour éphémère des hommes à privilèges''. On the [[Bourbon Restoration]] he was not prosecuted, either for libel or for the colonnes infernales.  He was on the list of those awarded the [[cross of Saint-Louis]], but died before being able to attend an official ceremony of the order to receive it.

== Distinctions ==
* Baron de [[Linières]] (1812)
* Chevalier de Saint-Louis (1814)
* His name is engraved on the 15th column of the [[Arc de Triomphe]] colonne (the Arch shows '''TURREAU''').
