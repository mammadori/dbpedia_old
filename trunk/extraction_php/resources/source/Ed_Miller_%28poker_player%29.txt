The Queer Eye summary:

<blockquote>
"You can't be in Vegas without running into a card shark and Ed is that card shark. But you wouldn't know it by looking at him. The wild hair, the overgrown beard, and the overall unkempt look keeps Ed from looking like the high roller that he is. He has a nerdy look but nerdy can be cool. Unfortunately, Ed hasn't gotten the 'cool' part.

Even more unfortunate, Ed's parents lost their home during the wrath of Hurricane Katrina. This is a great time for our boys to 'make better' Ed and throw a poker tournament benefitting the relief efforts in New Orleans."<ref> {{cite web | title = Queer Eye Episode 237 Recap | url=http://www.bravotv.com/Queer_Eye//episode/237 | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}</ref>
