The '''Volkswagen Apollo''' is an [[automobile]] which was sold in [[Brazil]] between 1990 and 1992, when [[Volkswagen Group]] and [[Ford Motor Company]] shared models in [[South America]] in a joint venture known as [[autolatina|AutoLatina]].

It was a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] version of Ford Brasil's [[Ford Verona|Verona]], a two-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] based on the [[Europe]]an-sourced [[Ford Orion]].

It was replaced by the [[Volkswagen Logus]], which was, similarly, in turn, based on the Ford Orion.

==Engines==
The Apollo was only available with VW's 1.8&nbsp;[[litre]] [[petrol engine]].  There was also Ford's 1.6-litre [[CHT]] engine only for LX version of Ford Verona.

==Versions==
A choice of GL and GLS versions was offered, gasoline or ethanol powered.  A recurrent complaint from customers, owners of VW Apollos, was about the steel rod-operated gear shifting (instead of the traditionally used cable-operated).
