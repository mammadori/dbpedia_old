The '''Audi S6''' is a high-performance version of the [[Audi A6]], a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[luxury vehicle|luxury]] [[executive car]] produced by [[Germany|German]] [[automotive industry|automaker]] [[Audi]].<ref>AudiWorld.com [http://www.audiworld.com/model/s6/content.shtml North American S6 Model Guide] - historical S6 specifications, prices, and options</ref>  It went on sale in 1994, shortly after the "'''A6'''" designation was introduced, replacing the "'''[[Audi 100|100]]'''" nameplate.  The original S6 (''Ur-S6'') was largely the same car as the outgoing, original [[Audi S4#C4|Audi S4 (C4)]] (''Ur-S4''), with the only visible differences being new body-cladding and badging.

The S6, like all [[Audi S and RS models|Audi "S" models]], is fitted as standard with Audi's trademark [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] [[four-wheel drive]] (4WD) system, the S6 using the [[Torsen]]-based permanent 4WD.

Audi was restructuring their model lineup in early and mid-1990s, and in late 1994, began selling the fifth generation (C4) [[Audi 100]] model, re-badged as the [[Audi A6]].  Wanting to keep a sports-saloon in their lineup, the company made small revisions to what was previously known as the [[Audi S4]], renaming it the '''Audi S6'''; the S4 name would eventually be re-used for a completely different model derived from Audi's smaller [[Volkswagen B platform|Volkswagen Group B platform]]-based [[Audi A4]].  As this was the first S6 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the ''[[Audi Ur-S4 / Ur-S6|Ur-S6]]'', derived from the German augmentive, "'''Ur'''sprünglich" (meaning: original).

It was available as both a [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] (''typ'' 4A5), and an "Avant" (''typ'' 4A9) ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]]) to [[Europe]]an and [[United States]] customers, but only as a saloon in [[Canada]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]].  Audi's trademark "[[procon-ten]]" safety system was standard fitment.

===C4 powertrain===
From its launch in late 1994, the S6 was powered by a {{convert|2226|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[straight-5|inline five-cylinder]] [[petrol engine]] (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN) with a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] [[engine control unit]] (ECU) , producing a [[motive power|power output]] of {{convert|169|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 5900&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], and {{convert|326|Nm|0|lk=on}} at around 1950&nbsp;rpm, whilst consuming high [[octane rating|octane]] "Super Plus" 98RON unleaded [[petrol]].  This powerful [[internal combustion engine|engine]] gave the S6 surprisingly good performance, it had a top speed of {{convert|235|km/h|1|lk=on}}, and accelerated from 0 to {{convert|100|km/h|1|abbr=on}} in 6.1 [[second]]s; with {{convert|160|km/h|1|abbr=on}} being reached in 17.5 seconds.

The vehicle was available with a standard six-speed [[manual transmission]] (five-speed only in [[North America]]), and Audi's dynamic [[Torsen]] T-1 [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system.

Audi made a high-performance, 4.2&nbsp;litre [[V8 engine]] (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AEC) with a Bosch KE-Motronic ECU available as an option in the original [[Europe]]an S4s, and made the decision to continue to do so with the S6, making a {{convert|213|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} version of the 4.2 available as an optional upgrade over the 2.2&nbsp;litre inline five-cylinder turbo.  Unlike the 5-cylinder turbocharged version, the V8-powered S6 was supplied with a five-speed [[automatic transmission]] as standard, but kept the quattro four wheel drive.  A six-speed manual gearbox was also available as an option.

===C4 brakes, wheels and tyres===
C4 [[brake|braking]] system included radially ventilated [[disc brake]]s front and rear; with {{convert|314|mm|1|lk=on}} diameter by {{convert|30|mm|2|abbr=on}} thick discs, with two-piston floating [[Girling]] calipers bearing the interlocking four-ringed [[Audi]] [[logo]], and four individual pads per caliper up front, and {{convert|269|mm|1|lk=on}} by {{convert|20|mm|2|abbr=on}} discs with [[Lucas]] single-piston sliding calipers at the rear.  [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS) with EDS was also standard.

Standard [[wheel]]s were 7½Jx16 "Avus" cast aluminium [[alloy wheel]]s with 225/50R16 [[tire|tyres]].  An optional 7½Jx15 five-arm alloy wheel, with 215/60R15 tyres, an 8Jx16 five double-spoke alloy, and an 8Jx17 10-spoke alloy were also available.

===Audi S6 PLUS{{anchor|S6+}}===
As a [[swan song]] to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production '''Audi S6 PLUS''' was briefly available to [[Europe]]an customers.  The S6 PLUS, developed by Audi's wholly owned high performance subsidiary - '''[[quattro GmbH]]''', was available for sale during the 1997 [[model year]] only (production from June 1996 to October 1997).  A total of 952 cars were produced - 855 Avant, and 97 saloons.

It was powered by another version of the [[multi-valve|32 valve]] (four valves per cylinder) 4.2&nbsp;litre [[V8 engine]] (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AHK, later to be seen in the [[Audi S8]] as AKH).  Audi's performance division reworked key parts of the [[internal combustion engine|engine]], increasing the [[motive power|power output]] to {{convert|240|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.  It was only available with a revised six-speed [[manual transmission]] (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DGU) ([[gear ratio]]s - 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730), with a final drive ratio of 4.111.

Further revisions were made to the suspension, [[brake]]s and [[wheel|roadwheels]].  The front [[disc brake|brake discs]] were enlarged to {{convert|323|mm|1|lk=on}} in diameter by {{convert|30|mm|2|abbr=on}} thick.  Standard roadwheels were 8Jx17 "Avus" cast aluminium [[alloy wheel]]s, with an optional 7Jx16 alloy wheel for use with winter tyres was also available.

With so much power on tap, the S6 Plus could reach {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on|lk=on}} from a standstill in 5.6 (saloon) and 5.7 (Avant) seconds, making it comparable in terms of acceleration to vehicles like the [[Porsche 944 Turbo]].

[[hella (company)|Hella]] [[xenon arc lamp|xenon]] [[high-intensity discharge lamp|high intensity discharge]] (HID) headlamps (still with the C4s triple bulb design) were available as an option.

In late 1997, [[Audi]] introduced an all-new range of [[Audi A6]] models, based on the [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C5|Volkswagen Group C5 platform]].  A new '''Audi S6''', now officially known as the '''Audi S6 quattro''' appeared in 1999, to complement its A6 [[automobile platform|platform]]-mate.  It was available in a 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] and a 5-door Avant ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]]).  In [[North America]] the Avant bodystyle was the only version available.  The vehicle could accelerate from 0 to {{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} in  6.7 seconds, and from 0 to {{convert|200|km/h|1|abbr=on}} in just 21.7 seconds.  The top speed was electronically governed to {{convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.

This generation of S6 went out of production in 2003.

===C5 powertrain===
[[Motive power]] is from a new rubber-hydro mounted all-[[aluminium alloy]] 4.2&nbsp;litre [[multi-valve|40-valve]] (five valves per cylinder) 90° [[V8 engine|V8]] [[petrol engine]], with twin [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshafts]] (two per [[cylinder bank]]) and [[solenoid]]-operated [[magnesium]] two-stage [[variable length intake manifold|variable intake manifold]] (parts code:&nbsp;077, identification codes:&nbsp;AQJ [Sept 99-May 01], ANK [Sept 00-onwards]). It displaced {{convert|4172|cc|abbr=on|lk=on}}, and was rated at {{convert|250|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 6,600&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], producing {{convert|420|Nm|abbr=on|lk=on}} of [[torque]] at 3,400&nbsp;rpm.  It satisfied the [[European Union]] EU3 emissions standard, and engine management was by way of a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] ME&nbsp;7.0 [[engine control unit]], with manifold-sited sequential [[fuel injection]], mapped direct ignition with eight individual spark coils, Bosch longlife [[spark plug]]s, four heated [[lambda]] sensors and two [[catalytic converter]]s, cylinder-selective knock control, and a Bosch "E-Gas" [[drive by wire]] throttle.  The engine was now cooled with the aid of two electric [[fan (mechanical)|cooling fans]], replacing the single [[viscosity|viscous]] fan of earlier models.

An oil-cooled six-speed [[manual transmission]] (parts code:&nbsp;01E, identification code:&nbsp;EEY) ([[gear ratio]]s: 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730; and final drive ratio: 4.111) was standard fitment, and an optional [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[ZF 5HP24 transmission|5HP24]] five-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] (parts code:&nbsp;01L, identification codes:&nbsp;EFN [Sept 99-May 01], FBD [June 00-onwards]) (gear ratios: 1st: 3.571, 2nd: 2.200, 3rd: 1.508, 4th: 1.000, 5th: 0.803; and final drive ratio: 2.909), with [[steering wheel]]-mounted paddle-shifts, and "Dynamic Shift Programme" (DSP) was available.  [[Torsen]] T-2 based dynamic [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] was also standard.  Both front and rear [[axle]]s utilised "Electronic Differential Lock" (EDL), which is a functuion of the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;5.7 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]].

===C5 suspension and steering===
Compared to its A6 sibling, the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] on the S6 was stiffened and lowered by {{convert|10|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, and utilised gas-pressurised [[shock absorber]]s.

[[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] rack and pinion "[[power steering#servotronic|servotronic]]" speed-sensitive [[power steering]] was standard.

===C5 brakes, wheels and tyres===
[[Brake]]s consisted of radially vented [[disc brake|brake discs]] front and rear.  The fronts are sized at {{convert|321|mm|2|lk=on}} diameter by {{convert|30|mm|2|abbr=on}} thick, and are clamped by [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] HP2 four-pad [[brake caliper|calipers]].  At the rear, the discs are {{convert|269|mm|2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|22|mm|2|abbr=on}}, and use a Lucas single-piston sliding caliper.

[[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;5.7 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]], with [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS), [[Brake Assist]], and [[electronic brakeforce distribution|Electronic Brakeforce Distribution]] (EBD) completed the brake system.

Wheels are 8Jx17" cast alloy "Avus" 6-spoke [[alloy wheel]]s, with 255/40 ZR17 [[tire|tyres]].

===C5 body and interior===
The body panels were largely based on the [[Audi A6]] 4.2 model, with slightly flared wheel arches and door sills, with the bonnet (hood) and front wings being constructed from [[aluminium]].  Other features included S6 badging, bolstered seats (optional [[Recaro]] seats), polished aluminium exterior door mirror housings, unique front grille, and rear bootlid/tailgate spoiler.

===Audi RS6 (C5)===
{{main|Audi RS6}}
A higher performance '''[[Audi RS6]]''' was also available for a limited timescale.  It was built by [[Audi]]s' high performance private subsidiary company - '''[[quattro GmbH]]'''.  It used a [[twin-turbo]] ("biturbo") version of the 4.2&nbsp;litre [[V8 engine]] (identification code: BCY).  [[motive power|Power]] figures were {{convert|331|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 5,700 - 6,400&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], with [[torque]] rated at {{convert|560|Nm|0|lk=on}} from 1,950 - 5,600&nbsp;rpm.  Transmission was a five-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]].

[[wheel|Roadwheels]] and [[tire|tyres]] were upgraded to 255/40 ZR18 99Y XL, or 255/35 ZR19 96Y XL (5/15 arm design), and there was an optional "Dynamic Ride Control" (DRC) system available for the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], which featured diagonally interlinked shock absorbers, to give better body control during extreme cornering, acceleration and braking.  Compared to standard S6, the suspension was lowered by {{convert|20|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=on}}.  The brake discs were ventilated and upgraded to {{convert|365|mm|2|lk=on}} at the front and {{convert|335|mm|2|abbr=on}} at the rear.

0-{{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}} took just 4.6&nbsp;[[second]]s.  0-{{convert|200|km/h|1|abbr=on}} was 16.6 (saloon) and 16.8 (Avant) seconds.

[[Image:Black S6 Avant.jpg|thumb|250px|Audi C6 S6 Avant]]
The latest '''Audi S6 quattro''' model (''Typ'' 4F) was introduced at the 2006 [[North American International Auto Show]] in January.  It is based on the current C6 [[Audi A6]], and uses the [[Volkswagen Group C platform#C6|Volkswagen Group C6 platform]], and is available in [[sedan (car)|saloon/sedan]] and Avant ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]]) bodystyles.  Factory production started in June 2006.

===C6 powertrain===
[[Image:Audi S6 Engine.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Audi C6 S6 [[V10 engine]]]]
[[Motive power]] in the C6 S6 [[powertrain]] features an all [[aluminium alloy]] {{convert|5204|cc|1|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) [[multi-valve|40-valve]] (four valves per cylinder) 90° [[V10 engine|V10]] [[petrol engine]] (parts code: 07L, identification code: BXA), derived from the [[Lamborghini]] [[Lamborghini Gallardo|Gallardo]] [[Lamborghini V10|5.0&nbsp;litre V10]].  A longer [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] and wider [[bore (engine)|bore]] increases the [[engine displacement|displacement]] of the engine, and produces more [[torque]] at lower revs, making it more suitable for the larger and heavier Audi executive passenger car.  It has been re-tuned to produce {{convert|320|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} at 6,800&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], and {{convert|540|Nm|0|lk=on}} of torque between 3,000-4,000&nbsp;rpm.  It utilises twin chain-driven [[overhead camshaft#double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshafts]] (DOHC), and [[variable valve timing]] for both intake and exhaust valves.  Engine management is by way of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] MED&nbsp;9.1 [[engine control unit]], which controls the mapped direct ignition, ten individual spark coils, [[common rail]] cylinder-direct sequential mulit-point [[fuel injection]], and [[drive by wire]] throttle.

The same engine is used in the latest [[Audi S8#D3|Audi S8 (D3)]], in a higher state of tune where it develops {{convert|331|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}.

A [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[ZF 6HP26 transmission|6HP26]] six-speed [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] (parts code: 09E, identification codes: JBW, JMS, KHD, JLL) ([[gear ratio]]s - 1st: 4.171, 2nd: 2.340, 3rd: 1.521, 4th: 1.143, 5th: 0.867, 6th: 0.691), with [[steering wheel]]-mounted "paddle-shifters" is the only transmission available.  [[Torsen]]-based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]], and from 2007 [[model year]] with the latest 40:60 front:rear asymmetric/dynamic Torsen T-3 [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]], are standard.  The final drive ratio is 3.801.  Traction is assisted "Electronic Differential Lock" (EDL) and "Anti-Slip Regulation" (ASR) (commonly known as [[traction control system]]) - both functions of the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;8.0 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]].

For the sprint to {{convert|100|km/h|1|lk=on}}, the S6 saloon takes 5.2&nbsp;seconds, with the quarter mile passing in 13.5&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/audi/a6/2007/specs/|title=2007 Audi S6 Specifications|work=JB car pages}}</ref>  Top speed is electronically limited to {{convert|250|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.

===C6 brakes, wheels and tyres===
The [[brake]]s consist of radially ventilated [[disc brake|discs]] front and rear.  The fronts are sized at {{convert|385|mm|2|lk=on}} in diameter by {{convert|36|mm|3|lk=on}} thick, and are clamped by gloss black painted [[Continental AG|Continental Teves]] two-piston sliding calipers.  The rear discs are {{convert|330|mm|2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|22|mm|3|lk=on}} thick, and use gloss black [[Lucas Industries#girling|Girling]]-[[TRW]] single piston sliding calipers with an integrated electro-mechanical parking brake.

A [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;8.0 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]], with [[anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock Braking System]] (ABS), [[Brake Assist]], and [[electronic brakeforce distribution|Electronic Brakeforce Distribution]] (EBD) completed the brake system.

Standard [[alloy wheel]]s consist of 9Jx19" cast aluminium alloy "5-arm wing design", shod with [[Continental AG|Continental]] SportContact2 265/35ZR19 [[tire|tyres]].  An optional 8½Jx18" cast alloy "S design" with 255/40ZR18 tyres (either Conti SportContact2 or [[Bridgestone]] Potenza RE050A) are also available.  A direct-acting [[tire pressure monitoring system|tyre pressure monitoring system]] is also standard.

===C6 other features===
The S6 features two rows of 5 distinctive [[light-emitting diode|LED]] [[daytime running lamp]]s (DRLs) along each side of the front bumper as a point of differentiation from other A6 models.  Bi-[[xenon arc lamp|Xenon]] [[high-intensity discharge lamp|high-intensity discharge]] (HID) [[headlamp#advanced front-lighting system (AFS)|adaptive headlights]] which swivel around corners compliment the LED DRLs.

===Audi RS6 (C6)===
{{main|Audi RS6}}
