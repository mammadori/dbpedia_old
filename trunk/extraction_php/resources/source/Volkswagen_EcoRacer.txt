The '''Volkswagen EcoRacer''' is a [[Volkswagen]] [[concept car]] first shown to the public at the 2005 [[Tokyo Motor Show]].  It combines the performance of a sports car with fuel-efficiency equal to the most fuel-efficient cars available in 2005. 

It was designed by Cesar Muntada Roura, a 37 years old, Barcelona born Designer, who previously worked in the Design Center of PSA Peugeot and of Honda.  He is also the acclaimed author of the successful project "Showdown", a [[Harley-Davidson]] based concept-bike alloted to be made by 2025.

==Performance==
The EcoRacer accelerates from 0-100&nbsp;km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph) in 6.3 seconds.  The top speed is 230&nbsp;km/h (143&nbsp;mph).  The average fuel consumption is 3.40 liters per 100 km (69 [[miles per gallon]]).

==Engine==
It has a [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered, [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[internal combustion engine]] with a displacement of 1.5&nbsp;L.  Despite the small displacement it delivers 100 [[kilowatt]]s (136&nbsp;hp) with 250&nbsp;NÂ·m of torque at 1900&nbsp;rpm.  The engine is of the [[common rail]] type, which is more efficient and quieter than the conventional rotary pump injection systems.  It is equipped with a [[particulate matter]] filter. The engine is linked to a [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG) with 7 gears, and is a mid-mount in front of the rear axle

==The Car==
The EcoRacer seats two people, and has a small luggage compartment.  The body is made of carbon fibre, which resulted in a relatively low weight of 850 [[kilogram]]s (approximately 1875 lb).  It is 3.765 meters long (148 in) with a wheelbase of 2.48 [[meter]]s (97.6 in).

The car is a veritable transformer, with three modes: coupe, roadster (no roof) and speedster (no a-pillar/windscreen).
