'''Mercedes-Benz''' is a German manufacturer of [[luxury]] [[automobile]]s, [[bus]]es, [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]], and [[truck]]s.  It is currently a division of the parent company, [[Daimler AG]] (formerly DaimlerChrysler AG), after previously being owned by [[Daimler-Benz]].  Mercedes-Benz has its origins in [[Karl Benz]]'s creation of the first [[petrol engine|petrol]]-powered motorcycle in January 1886,<ref name=MBoverview>[http://www.edmunds.com/mercedesbenz/history.html Edmunds.com - Mercedes-Benz History]</ref> and by  [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and engineer [[Wilhelm Maybach]]'s conversion of a 1873 [[Amédée Bollée|Bollée]] steam-engine automobile by the addition of a petrol engine the same year.  The [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] automobile was first marketed in 1901 by [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]].  The first Mercedes-Benz [[brand name]] vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz's and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company.<ref name=MBoverview/>  Mercedes-Benz has introduced many technological and safety [[#innovations|innovations]] that have become common in other vehicles several years later.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Quality==
Since its inception, Mercedes-Benz had maintained a reputation for its quality and durability.  Objective measures looking at [[passenger vehicles]] - such as [[J.D. Power]] surveys, demonstrated a downturn in reputation in this criteria in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  By mid-2005, Mercedes temporarily returned to the industry average for initial quality, a measure of problems after the first 90&nbsp;days of ownership, according to J.D. Power.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/autos/autobeat/archives/2006/11/measuring_merce.html Business Week, November 2006]</ref>  In J.D. Power's Initial Quality Study for the first quarter of 2007, Mercedes showed dramatic improvement by climbing from 25th to 5th place, surpassing quality leader [[Toyota]], and earning several awards for its models.<ref>[http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/pressrelease.aspx?ID=2007088 J.D.

The two companies which were merged to form the ''Mercedes-Benz'' brand in 1926 had both already enjoyed success in the new sport of [[auto racing|motor racing]] throughout their separate histories - both had entries in the very first automobile race [[auto racing#The Start|Paris to Rouen 1894]].  This has continued, and throughout its long history, the company has been involved in a range of motorsport activities, including [[sports car racing]] and [[rally racing|rallying]].  On several occasions Mercedes-Benz has withdrawn completely from motorsport for a significant period, notably in the late 1930s, and after the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]], where a [[Mercedes-Benz 300SLR]] collided with another car and killed more than 80 spectators.  Although there was some activity in the intervening years, it was not until 1987 that Mercedes-Benz returned to front line competition, returning to Le Mans, [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM), and [[Formula One]] with [[Sauber]].

The 1990s saw Mercedes-Benz purchase [[United Kingdom|British]] engine builder [[Ilmor]] (now [[Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines]]), and campaign [[IndyCar Series|IndyCars]] under the [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]]/[[Champ Car|CART]] rules, eventually winning the [[1994 Indianapolis 500]] and [[1994 CART World Series season|1994 CART IndyCar World Series]] Championship with [[Al Unser, Jr.]] at the wheel.  The 1990s also saw the return of Mercedes-Benz to GT racing, and the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR]], both of which took the company to new heights by dominating the FIA's GT1 class.

Mercedes-Benz is currently active in three forms of motorsport, [[Formula Three]], DTM and Formula One.  
=== Formula 1 === 
{{Main|Mercedes Grand Prix}}
In Formula One, the company part-owns [[Team McLaren]], and has supplied the team with engines engineered by Ilmor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2001/jan03/tytler.html |title=Ilmor: Bowmen of the Silver Arrows |publisher=Atlasf1.autosport.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> since 1995.  This partnership has brought success, including Drivers Championships for [[Mika Häkkinen]] in 1998 and 1999, and for [[Lewis Hamilton]] in 2008, as well as a Constructors Championship in 1998.  The collaboration with McLaren has been extended into the production of roadgoing cars such as the [[Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren]].

In 2009, [[Ross Brawn]]'s newly conceived Formula One team, [[Brawn GP]] used Mercedes engines to help win the Constructor's Championship, and [[Jenson Button]] to become champion in the F1 Drivers' Championship. It also sold back its 40% stake in McLaren to the McLaren Group and now owns 70% of the Brawn GP team jointly with an Abu Dubai based investment consortium. Brawn GP will be renamed Mercedes Grand Prix in 2010.

==Business alliances (Studebaker-Packard Corporation)==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
In 1958, Mercedes-Benz entered into a distribution agreement with the [[Studebaker-Packard Corporation]] of [[South Bend, Indiana]] (USA), makers of [[Studebaker]] and [[Packard]] brand automobiles.  Under the deal, Studebaker would allow Mercedes-Benz access to their [[United States|U.S.]] dealer network, handle shipments of vehicles to those dealers, and in return receive compensation for each car sold.  Studebaker also was permitted to use the German automaker's name in its advertisements, which stressed Studebaker's quality over quantity.

When Studebaker entered into informal discussions with Franco-American automaker [[Facel Vega]] about offering their [[Facel Vega Excellence]] model in the United States, Mercedes-Benz objected to the proposal.  Studebaker, which needed Mercedes-Benz distribution payments to help stem heavy losses, dropped further action on the plan.

Mercedes-Benz maintained an office within the Studebaker works in South Bend from 1958 to 1963, when Studebaker's U.S. operations ceased.  Many U.S Studebaker dealers converted to Mercedes-Benz dealerships at that time.  When Studebaker closed its Canadian operation and left the automobile business in 1966, remaining Studebaker dealers had the option to convert their dealerships to Mercedes-Benz dealership agreements.

===McLaren cars===
[[File:Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren 2 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A silver SLR McLaren on display at the 2006 European Motor Show in Brussels]]
Mercedes-Benz has also produced a limited-production [[sports car]] with [[McLaren Cars]], an extension of the collaboration by which Mercedes engines are used by the [[McLaren (racing)|Team McLaren-Mercedes]] [[Formula One]] racing team, which is part owned by Mercedes.  The 2003 [[Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren]] has a [[carbon fiber|carbon fibre]] body with a 5.4&nbsp;[[litre]] [[V8 engine|V8]] [[supercharger|supercharged]] engine.  This is the same [[cylinder block]] as featured in SL55 AMG and the CLS55 AMG, though modified to give {{convert|460|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} and {{convert|780|Nm|0|lk=on}} of torque. The SLR has a maximum speed of {{convert|337|km/h|1}} and costs approximately US$500,000.  Due to European pedestrian-protection regulations, McLaren has decided to cease production of the SLR in 2009.<ref>[http://automobile.automotive.com/7561/0710-2008-mercedes-benz-slr-mclaren-roadster/index.html Automobile Magazine]</ref>

The most recent new joint-venture model, expected to reach production, is the mid-engine '''P8''' sports car.  Based around a unique carbon fibre [[monocoque]], manufactured by McLaren, the P8 was originally predicted to receive the new naturally aspirated 6.2&nbsp;litre V8 from [[Mercedes-AMG]], but insiders{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} now say that the engine will be modified for the car and will probably be [[twin-turbo]]charged to produce in excess of {{convert|600|bhp|kW PS|0}}.  The car is still in development, but likely to reach production to go on sale in early 2008, and have a price tag less than that of the [[Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren|SLR]].

===Car nomenclature===
In 1994 (starting with the 1994 models), the traditional nomenclature of Mercedes-Benz vehicles changed.  Since the early days of the company, the name would be in the form of (for example) [[Mercedes-Benz 500E|500E]] where the [[engine displacement]] made up the first three numbers and the last letter(s) represented the type of engine and/or chassis; for example: '''E''' for [[fuel injection]] ({{lang-de|Einspritzung}}), '''D''' for [[diesel engine|Diesel]], '''L''' for long-[[wheelbase]], etcetera.

In 1994, this was altered so that the prefix reflected the model or '''Class''', {{lang-de|Klasse}}, in Mercedes-Benz terminology, and a number for the engine displacement.  The suffix was retained in some cases, for example '''L''' for long wheelbase, and '''CDI''' for Diesel (CDI = [[common rail|Common-rail]] [[direct injection|Direct Injection]]).  Thus, the 500E in the example above became the E500 ("E-Klasse", 5&nbsp;litres displacement).  It should also be noted that while in the past the model number generally accurately reflected the actual engine displacement, this is currently not always the case — for example the E200 CDI and E220 CDI actually both have a 2.2&nbsp;litre displacement, and the C240 actually has a 2.6&nbsp;litre engine.

===Electric vehicles===
Mercedes has showed in 2009 the [[Mercedes-Benz Vision S500 PHEV|Vision S500 PHEV]] petrol [[concept vehicle]] with a {{convert|19|mi}} [[all-electric range]] and [[CO2 emission]]s of 74&nbsp;[[gram]]s/[[km]] in the [[New European Driving Cycle]].<ref>http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1072.html</ref>

At the 2007 [[Frankfurt motor show]], Mercedes-Benz also showed seven hybrid models, including the F700 [[concept vehicle|concept car]] - which combined hybrid drive with the innovative DiesOtto engine.<ref>[http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Sep07/06_Mercedes_Details_What_To_Expect_At_The_International_Auto_Show_In_Frankfurt.html Mercedes vehicles at the 2007 Frankfurt show]</ref><ref>[http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId=101846&topicId=103840033&docId=l:676599248 A hybrid drives Mercedes concept]</ref>

In 2009, the S400 hybrid saloon is scheduled to go on sale.<ref>[http://www.caranddriver.com/autoshows/13994/mercedes-benz-future-hybrid-lineup.html 2007 IAA Report - S-Class hybrid]</ref>

On the other hand, Mercedes-Benz says it will have a demonstration fleet of practical, if small, electric vehicles on the road in two to three years, from 2008.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/environment/2008-03-23-mercedes-electric-car-battery_N.htm Mercedes sees electric-car progress - USATODAY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Innovations==
Numerous technological innovations have been introduced on Mercedes-Benz automobiles throughout the many years of their production, including:
*The [[internal combustion engine]]d automobile was developed independently by Benz and Daimler & Maybach in 1886
*Daimler invented the honeycomb radiator of the type still used on all water-cooled vehicles today
*Daimler invented the float [[carburetor]] which was used until replaced by [[fuel injection]]
*The "drop chassis" - the car originally designated the "Mercedes" by Daimler was also the first car with a modern configuration, having the carriage lowered and set between the front and rear wheels, with a [[front-engine design|front engine]] and [[rear-wheel drive|powered rear wheels]].  All earlier cars were "horseless carriages", which had high centres of gravity and various engine/drive-train configurations
*The first passenger road car to have [[brake]]s on all four wheels (1924)<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.roadsafe.com/magazine/2007spring/manufacturers.html Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*The "safety cage" or "[[automobile safety|safety cell]]" construction with front and rear [[crumple zones]] was first developed by Mercedes-Benz in 1951.  This is considered by many as the most important innovation in automobile construction from a safety standpoint<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2005/03/11/010089.html Mercedes-Benz Safety Innovations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Verify source|date=September 2009}}
*In 1959, Mercedes-Benz patented a device that prevents drive wheels from spinning by intervening at the engine, transmission, or brakes.  In 1987, Mercedes-Benz applied its patent by introducing a [[traction control system]] that worked under both braking and acceleration
*[[traction control system|Traction control]] and [[airbag]]s in the European market, were Mercedes-Benz innovations.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}  These technologies were introduced in 1986, and 1980 respectively
*Mercedes-Benz was the first to introduce pre-tensioners to [[seat belt]]s on the 1981 S-Class.  In the event of a crash, a pre-tensioner will tighten the belt instantaneously, removing any 'slack' in the belt, which prevents the occupant from jerking forward in a crash
*In September 2003, Mercedes-Benz introduced the world's first seven-speed [[automatic transmission]] called '[[7G-Tronic]]'
*[[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP), [[brake assist]],<ref>[http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Jun06/22_Mercedes_Debuts_PRE_SAFE_Brake_System_1.html Mercedes Introduces PRE-SAFE Brake Safety System] Posted on June 22, 2006, The Unofficial Mercedes-Benz Weblog</ref> and many other types of safety equipment were all developed, tested, and implemented into passenger cars—first—by Mercedes-Benz.  Mercedes-Benz has not made a large fuss about its innovations, and has even licensed them for use by competitors — in the name of improving automobile and passenger safety.  As a result, crumple zones and anti-lock brakes (ABS) are now standard on all modern vehicles.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>{{Verify source|date=September 2009}}
[[File:Mercedes-Benz M156 Engine 02.JPG|right|thumb|Mercedes M156 engine]]
*The most powerful naturally-aspirated eight cylinder engine in the world is the [[Mercedes-AMG]], [[Mercedes-Benz M156 engine|6208 cc M156]] V8 engine.  The [[V8 engine]] is badged '63 AMG', and replaced the '55 AMG' M113 engine in most models.  The M156 engine produces up to {{convert|391|kW|PS bhp|abbr=on}}, and although some models using this engine do have this output (such as the S63 and CL63 AMGs), specific output varies slightly across other models in the range<ref>[http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/mercedes-amg-v8-engine.htm Mercedes-AMG 6.2-litre V8 Engine : News & Reports : Motoring : Web Wombat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*The [[Mercedes-Benz W211|(W211) E320 CDI]] which has a [[variable geometry turbocharger]] (VTG) 3.0&nbsp;litre [[V6 engine|V6]] [[common rail]] diesel engine (producing 224-horsepower), set three world [[endurance]] records.  It covered {{convert|100000|mi|km}} in a record time, with an average speed of {{convert|224.823|km/h|2}}.  Three identical cars did the endurance run (one set above record) and the other two cars set world records for time taken to cover {{convert|100000|km|0}} and {{convert|50000|mi|km}} respectively.  After all three cars had completed the run, their combined distance was {{convert|300000|mi|km}} (all records were FIA approved).<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=105638 New Mercedes Diesel Engine Breaks World Endurance Record<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*Mercedes-Benz pioneered a system called [[Pre-Safe]] to detect an imminent crash - and prepares the car's safety systems to respond optimally.  It also calculates the optimal braking force required to avoid an accident in emergency situations, and makes it immediately available for when the driver depresses the brake pedal. Occupants are also prepared by tightening the seat belt, closing the sunroof and windows, and moving the seats into the optimal position.
*Mercedes Benz developed a fatigue-detection system, known as Attention Assist, that warns the driver when they are displaying signs of micro-sleep (when the eyes stay closed for slightly longer than a natural blinking action).  The system will use a variety of data including the individual driving style, the duration of the journey, the time of day and the current traffic situation.  Fatigue mostly sets in gradually.<ref>[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2006/11/21/029431.html "Fatigue at the wheel: Mercedes-Benz developing warning system for motorists"], The Auto Channel, November 21, 2006.</ref>
*The fastest street-legal [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] car in the world is the [[Brabus Rocket]], based on the [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class|CLS-Class]] saloon.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*Mercedes Benz invented the [[adaptive highbeam assist]] system, which automatically and continuously adapts the headlamp range to the distance of vehicles ahead or which are oncoming.  The new system continually adjusts the beam so that the headlamp cone falls just in front of other vehicles, at the same time always ensuring maximum possible range without dazzling other road users.  The [[adaptive highbeam assist]] is introduced first in the new generation [[W212|E-Class]].

Half a century of vehicle safety innovation helped win Mercedes- Benz the Safety Award at the 2007 What Car? Awards <ref name="autogenerated1" />

===Robot cars===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
{{Main|Driverless car}}
In the 1980s, Mercedes built the world's first robot car, together with the team of Professor [[Ernst Dickmanns]] at [[Bundeswehr]] Universität [[München]]. Partially encouraged by Dickmanns' success, in 1987 the  [[European Union]]'s [[EUREKA]] programme initiated  the [[EUREKA Prometheus Project|Prometheus Project]] on autonomous vehicles, funded to the tune of nearly 800 million [[Euro]]s.  A culmination point was achieved in 1995, when Dickmanns' re-engineered autonomous  [[S-Class]] Mercedes took a long trip from [[Munich]] in [[Bavaria]] to [[Copenhagen]] in [[Denmark]], and back.  On highways, the robot achieved speeds exceeding {{convert|175|km/h}} (roughly 110 miles per hour; permissible in some areas of the German [[Autobahn]]).  The car's abilities has heavily influenced robot car research and funding decisions worldwide.

==[[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]]==
{{clarify|date=November 2009|post-text=(what does "CAFE" mean)}}
In the United States, due to an inability to meet federal fuel economy regulations, Mercedes-Benz was fined a record US$30.66 million.<ref>[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2009/01/08/huge-fine-for-mercedes-benz-for-poor-fuel-efficiency/ Huge fine for Mercedes-Benz for poor fuel efficiency] by Jeremy Korzeniewski on Jan 8th 2009, AutoblogGreen</ref>  Certain Mercedes-Benz cars sold in the United States also face an additional [[Energy Tax Act|gas guzzler tax]].
