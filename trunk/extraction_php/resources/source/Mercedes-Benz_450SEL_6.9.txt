The '''[[Mercedes-Benz]] 450SEL 6.9''' is a high-performance version of the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse|S-Class]] luxury saloon. It was built on its own assembly line by [[Daimler-Benz]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] and based on the long-wheelbase version of the [[Mercedes-Benz W116|W116]] chassis introduced in 1972. The model was generally referred to in the company's literature as the "6.9", to separate it from the regular 450SEL. 

The 6.9 was first shown to the motoring press at the [[Geneva]] [[Salon International de l'Auto|Auto Show]] in 1974, and produced between 1975 and 1981 in extremely limited numbers. It was billed as the flagship of the Mercedes-Benz car line, and the successor to Mercedes-Benz's original high-performance sedan, the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3|300SEL 6.3]]. The 6.9 also has the distinction of being among the first vehicles ever produced with optional electronically-controlled [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]], first introduced by Mercedes-Benz and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] in 1978. The 6.9's successor — the top of range [[Mercedes-Benz W126|500 SEL]] — continued the 6.9's remarkable [[self-levelling suspension|self-leveling]] [[hydropneumatic]] suspension as an extra-cost option.

==Special features==
The 6.9 was the first Mercedes-Benz to be fitted with the [[hydropneumatic]] [[self-levelling suspension]] system developed by [[Citroën]] in 1955, unlike the 600 and 6.3 which employed [[air suspension]]s. Using a combination of fluid-filled struts and nitrogen-filled pressure vessels or "[[hydraulic accumulator|accumulators]]" in lieu of conventional [[shock absorber]]s and springs, the system was pressurized by a hydraulic pump driven by the engine's timing chain. Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citroën's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citroën system thus might result in loss of suspension.  Conversely, every unit of the 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven in the event of a hydraulic failure. The special hydraulic fluid required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Not only was the system totally self-adjusting, [[ride height]] could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50&nbsp;mm) for increased ground clearance. [[NHTSA]] decreed this feature illegal in the US market, but it could be enabled simply by removing a limiter at the tank-mounted control valve. 

The suspension system gave the 4200 pound (1900&nbsp;kg) car the benefits of a both a [[ride quality|smooth ride]] and [[car handling|handling]] that allowed it, in the words of automotive journalist [[David E. Davis]], to be "tossed about like a [[Mini]]." The car also featured a model W3B 050 three-speed [[automatic transmission]] unique to the 6.9 and a standard ZF [[limited slip differential]] both for enhanced [[roadholding]] performance on dry pavement and enhanced [[traction]] in inclement weather. 

Four-wheel [[disc brake]]s and four-wheel independent suspension were standard across the W116 model range.

==The M-100 power plant==
The engine was a [[cast iron]] [[V8]] with single overhead camshafts operating [[sodium]]-filled [[poppet valve|valve]]s (as are found in piston-driven aircraft) against hardened valve seats on each aluminium alloy cylinder head. Each hand-built unit was bench-tested for 265 minutes, 40 of which were under full load. Bosch "K-Jetronic" electromechanical [[fuel injection]] was standard at a time when fuel-injected cars were uncommon. As in all Mercedes-Benz automobile engines, the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons were [[Forging|forged]] instead of [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]]. In non-US trim, the 6.9&nbsp;[[litre|l]] (6814&nbsp;cc or 417&nbsp;in³) power plant was conservatively rated at 286&nbsp;hp (213&nbsp;kW) with 405&nbsp;ft·lbf (549&nbsp;N·m) of [[torque]] helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final [[mechanical advantage|drive ratio]] necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. The North American version, introduced in 1977, was rated with 36 fewer [[horsepower]] and 45 fewer ft-lb (250 and 360, respectively), due to more stringent emissions control requirements. In the interest of both engine longevity as well as creating some extra space under the hood, a "[[dry sump]]" engine [[lubrication]] system was used. Dry sump lubrication was originally developed for use in race cars as a way to prevent foaming of the engine oil by the crankshaft, which in turn would create a serious drop in oil pressure. The system circulated twelve quarts of oil between the storage tank and the engine, as opposed to the usual four or five quarts found in V8s with a standard oil pan and oil pump. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached to the inside of the tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 nearly maintenance-free for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km).  The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes, and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power steering filters.

==Race track performance==
Top speed was factory-rated at 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h), but some journalists testing the car saw speeds approaching 150&nbsp;mph (241&nbsp;km/h). Among those journalists was [[Brock Yates]]. Yates was approached by the factory to write promotional literature about the 6.9. He agreed, but under the condition that he could list the car's faults as well as its positives. Daimler-Benz agreed in turn, and Yates was given a US-spec 6.9 to drive from [[Manhattan]] to the [[Road Atlanta]] grand prix race track in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. There, Yates would drive the car in as-arrived condition at racing speeds for a full 40 laps or just over 100 miles (160 km). The only change made to the car upon its arrival at Road Atlanta was the necessary adjustment of tire pressure. This was a difficult task even for a purpose-built race car, let alone a street-legal sedan designed and geared for high-speed [[Autobahn]] cruising. The 6.9 suffered no mechanical problems and averaged a very respectable 72&nbsp;mph (116&nbsp;km/h) throughout the test, completing it with little more than excess dust on the bodywork from the [[Michelin]] [[radial tyre|radial]] street tires on which the car was driven to Atlanta. Yates was so comfortable driving the 6.9 around the track that he reported having run at least one lap with the sunroof open and the radio on, but the high price of the car made him think better of such risky driving and he finished the test with the radio off and both hands on the wheel<ref> [http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/brochure/brockyates/index.html Brock Yates' 6.9 Evaluation, from 6.9 Promotional Literature from Mercedes-Benz]</ref>.

==Price & interior features==
[[Image:450SEL6.9 dash.jpg|thumb|250px|The dashboard of a Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9, US version.]]
All of this technology came at a very high price. At a time when the most expensive [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]]s, the mid-sized [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] and full-sized Fleetwood Series Seventy-Five [[limousine]] each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than most [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]s. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was nearly $53,000 by the end of production.  The only way to get a 6.9 in the US or Canada prior to 1977 was to import one through the [[grey market]].  Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, it was a rather austere one compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull suspension control knob just under the speedometer, a low suspension pressure warning and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled [[walnut]] veneer on the dash and console.  The rest of the W116 lineup was trimmed in striated [[zebrano]] veneer. 

The 6.9 lacked expected luxury touches such as power-adjustable outside mirrors or front seats, although a unique power rear seat, heated seats and even orthopedically-designed front seats were options. Buyers outside North America could also opt for headlight wipers and washers and/or headlights with a special vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. There was also a new standard feature in 1977-- most Mercedes-Benz automobiles that year were equipped with a sophisticated electronic climate control system developed by [[Chrysler Corporation]] for use in their top models. The system turned on the heater, air conditioner or both, depending on the thermostat's setting and ambient temperature, automatically maintaining whatever temperature the driver selected. The compressor was an American import as well, supplied by the Harrison division of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]].

Far more modern than the contemporary Cadillac, which still had a [[live axle|live rear axle]], and both faster and larger inside than the either the Rolls-Royce or Cadillac, the 6.9 was indistinguishable from its W116 stablemates save for a modest "6.9" badge on the decklid and wider tires.US models also had different bumper rubbers fitted to the "park bench" impact absorbing bumpers. As discreet as the badge was, it could be deleted/ordered with option 261 ''omission of the displacement figure on the trunk lid'' at extra cost for those who wanted to avoid attention either from drivers of other high-performance cars or from law enforcement. In the words of David E. Davis, the 6.9 was "a $50,000 exercise in going fast."

Still, for fans of the discontinued 6.3 or for those who simply had to have a car which ''Car and Driver'' proclaimed to be "the greatest Mercedes-Benz ever built," it seemed that money was no object. At its launch in 1975, the 450SEL 6.9 cost [[German mark|DM]] 69,930. In the last year of production, 1979, the car was available at a price of DM 81,247. Even though this was far from inexpensive, the courage of the Mercedes-Benz strategists in launching the car onto the market paid off. A total of 7,380 units were built by 1980, and most of these were exported to the USA. This volume figure looks rather small at first glance, but production figures tend to be significantly smaller in the top luxury segment where this model competes. Also, the 6.9 was not the only S-Class model, and was purchased by the rich, the famous, and the powerful despite the rising cost of gasoline brought on by the [[1973 energy crisis|Arab oil embargo]].  Thus, the 7,380 total sales volume is quite respectable once the price and contemporary economic climate are taken into account.

==The 6.9 today==
In a poll conducted by Britain's ''Classic & Sports Car'' magazine and printed in their April 1999 edition, the Mercedes-Benz 6.9 ranked fourth on their list of the "world's greatest [[sedan (car)|saloons]]." <ref>[http://www.m-100.cc/6point9/magazines/classicandsportscar_0499/index.html Classic & Sports Car, April 1997 - Best Saloons Ever<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The May 2004 edition of another British publication, ''Mercedes Enthusiast'' magazine, ranked the 6.9 number fifteen on their all-time top twenty list of great Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Even with such accolades, a 6.9 is a reasonably priced collectible automobile despite its rarity. The online NADA Used Car Guide lists a top value of US$20,000. At present, the market for cars of this type is somewhat soft, and a prime example can be had for considerably less. Given the car's exotic engineering and the traditionally high cost of some Mercedes-Benz parts, certain parts unique to the 6.9 can be extremely rare and expensive.

==Notable versions==
* In 1976, French film director [[Claude Lelouch]] attached a gyro-stabilized camera to the front bumper of a 6.9 and drove it at high speed through the streets of [[Paris]] at daybreak.  The resulting nine-minute one-take [[cinéma vérité]] film, ''[[C'était un rendez-vous]]'', was greeted with moral outrage over the apparent risks taken by Lelouch as he sped past pedestrians and other vehicles.  However, the sound of a five gear [[Ferrari 275]]GTB was dubbed over the three gear 6.9.
*There were never any plans to build a [[station wagon]] version of the W116, 6.9 or otherwise, owing both to the location of the fuel tank ahead of the rear axle and the overwhelming demand for the sedan versions. Still, a number of W116s were converted to station wagons by coach builders in Germany and England (see [http://www.crayford-benz.org] for details of the English conversions). In 1977, a German diplomat named Manfred Sittmann commissioned ''[[Brinkmann]] Karosserie'' in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] to build a 6.9 station wagon, or "estate car." Sittmann frequently travelled with two large dogs and a family entourage to Italy. German motorsports magazine ''Auto, Motor und Sport'' learned of the car and requested an interview with Mr Sittmann and a photo shoot as well. The magazine's feature would be titled ''"Die teuerste Hundehütte,"'' or "The Most Expensive Doghouse." This one-off 6.9 currently{{when}} sees regular use with its third owner, a Mercedes-Benz collector in Pennsylvania. Another 450SEL 6.9 was converted to station wagon form for actress Sophia Loren -- complete with mesh dog-guard to prevent her hounds climbing into the passenger area (see [http://www.crayford-benz.org] for details.
