Through a new importer Carlsson began a more aggressive push into the US market in 2006 after debuting their newly modified CL500 (Euro-spec) vehicle at the 2006 SEMA Show. In their review, [[Modified Luxury & Exotics]] magazine said, "... the CL is starting to resemble something more in line with a Bentley Continental - even if it is a little shy when it comes to horsepower."<ref>''Modified Luxury & Exotics'' Tier-One Tuning, PP. 100 to 106, By Colum Wood.
