The '''Lamborghini V10''' is a [[petrol engine]] which was developed for the [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] automobile, first sold in 2003.

This is only the third engine developed by [[Lamborghini|Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.]], for use in the Gallardo, and the first engine developed by the company after they were acquired by [[Audi|Audi AG]] - part of the [[Volkswagen Group]].  As such, it shares components and technology from other members of the group, specifically Audi.

Its block is built at the [[Audi Hungaria Motor Kft.]] factory in [[Győr#industry|Győr]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambocars.com/archive/newl140.htm|title=Lamborghini Cars full specifications - First spyshots of the Lamborghini L140 model|work=LamboCars.com|accessdate=30 August 2009}}</ref> whilst final assembly is at [[Sant'Agata]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=119574|title=Conversation: Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann - Italian style, German quality|work=edmunds - Inside Line|publisher=Edmunds.com|date=27 February 2007|accessdate=30 August 2009}}</ref>  It is a 90° [[V10 engine]], which is unusual for this particular configuration of cylinders.  It was chosen to keep the [[center of gravity]] of the engine low.  For the same reason, a [[dry sump]] lubrication system was also used.

There is speculation that this engine will also be fitted to a planned [[Audi RSR]] sports car, based on the [[Audi Rosemeyer]] concept.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}

There was also some speculation that the engine block of the original 5.0&nbsp;[[litre]] V10 is closely based on the 4.2&nbsp;litre V8, which Audi produces for their luxury cars.  However, this was denied by Audi AG, in their official documentation for their 5.2 V10 FSI engine, as used in the [[Audi S6]] and [[Audi S8]].<ref>{{citation|date=June 2006|title=Audi 5.2 litre V10 FSI engine|edition=SSP 376|series=Service Training - Self-Study Programme|publication-place=D-74172 Neckarsulm, Germany|publisher=AUDI AG|quote=''The (Audi) V10 belongs to the next generation of Audi V-engines, all of which have a 90-degree included angle and a spacing of 90 millimetres between cylinder centres.  Compared to the engine in the Lamborghini Gallardo, which has a spacing of 88 millimetres between cylinder centres, the Audi engine has several new features in key areas.''}}</ref>  The [[cylinder head]]s are unique to Lamborghini, using the four valves per cylinder layout favoured by the Italian firm, rather than the five valve per cylinder variation used by the German members of Volkswagen Group - including Audi and [[Volkswagen]].{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}  However, it was later confirmed by Stefan Reil of Audi's [[quattro GmbH]] subsidiary that the new 5.2&nbsp;litre Lamborghini V10 does share technologes with the Audi V10 engine, as is evident by the usage of Audi's [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]], and 90&nbsp;mm cylinder spacing.
