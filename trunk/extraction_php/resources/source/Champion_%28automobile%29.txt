'''Champion''' Automobilwerke GmbH was a German producer of small cars, initially manufacturing in [[Paderborn]].   The cars were produced and sold by a succession of businesses between 1952 and 1958.   At the outset the cars were impressively simple and inexpensive, but as they became slightly less simple they also lost much of their price advantage.   As larger manufacturers moved centre stage in the German auto-market, the producers of the Champion failed to achieve the volumes necessary to justify the investment needed to develop and produce the cars: the brief story of the marque is of a succession of financial crises and failures.

==History==
The car originally developed by  [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] of  [[Friedrichshafen]] was a two seater with a single cylinder 200 cc rear-mounted two-stroke [[lawnmower]] engine<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/> supported by a [[supercharger]].   Power was delivered to the wheels via a three speed gear box:  despite the low weight of the car, there was also a reverse gear.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>  The first prototype was actually built further to the south at [[Herrlingen]] near [[Ulm]] in 1948.   The car was based around a central steel frame and employed a rear mounted engine, being clearly inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]] lay-out, but smaller and simpler having regard to the availability of production facilities and materials in the late 1940s.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711>{{cite journal| authorlink =  Paul Simsa| title = Erinnern Sie sich?

In 1949 a former BMW engineer then known for his work on early post-[[Second World War|war]] racing cars and named Hermann Holbein acquired the production rights for the car.  One year later, Holbein introduced the Champion, which would be assembled at the newly created Champion Automobilwerken plant in Paderborn until 1952.   In 1952 production was taken over by the [[Ludwigshafen]] based "Rheinische Automobilfabrik Hennhöfer & Co" company.   When this business went into liquidation a Dane named Henning Thorndahl took charge of assembling the vehicles until October 1954 when the last car was produced.  

In 1955 production was taken over by [[Maico]], a firm then as subsequently better known for its motor cycles.

== Champion 250 ==
The Champion 250 built under Holbein’s direction featured a rear-mounted [[Triumph (TWN)|Triumph (Germany)]] single cylinder engine of 250 cc producing a claimed 6 PS or a two cylinder engine providing a stated 10 PS of output.   Weights given for the car vary between 220&nbsp;kg and 250&nbsp;kg.   It was just 285&nbsp;cm (724 in) long and 136&nbsp;cm (345 in) wide.  The single cylinder version was said to be capable of 60&nbsp;km/h (37 mph) and the two cylinder version of 70&nbsp;km/h (44 mph).   

The specification of the car was basic.   The steel dish wheels were of a thinness commonly associated with basic motor-cycles and needed therefore to be pumped to a relatively high pressure.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>    The hardness of the tires and the minimalist approach taken to shock absorption made the cars strikingly uncomfortable.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/> Except for users of cabriolet versions with the roof open, above average agility was vital for anyone wishing to get in or out of a Champion.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>  Driver fitness was also encouraged by the need to start the engine with a [[starting handle]], there being no electric starter-motor.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>

The selling price was initially, DM 2,400 rising to DM 2,650 for the twin cylinder version:  this compares with DM 5,300 then being asked for a [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]].<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   225 or just under 400 of the cars were produced.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   Sources differ.

== Champion 400 / 500 ==
In 1951 the twin seater cabriolet-saloon Champion 400 was presented with a full width canvas roof reminiscent of the open topped [[Fiat Topolino]] though in other respects the overall architecture of the design remained closer to [[Volkswagen|Wolfsburg]] than to [[Fiat|Turin]].<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   The steel bodied car was reported to be notably more solidly constructed and the suspension had gained both in sophistication and in terms of ride comfort.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>  The weight of the car was now virtually doubled as against the original 250 model, to 520&nbsp;kg, and road-holding on the corners became more challenging.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>

Power came from a with a two cylinder 398 cc [[:de: ILO-Motorenwerke|ILO]] engine.   Output was now given as 14 PS, and the maximum speed increased to 80/85&nbsp;km/h (50/53 mph).<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   Between 1951 and 1952 around 2,000 were produced. However, the car no longer occupied the price niche of its predecessor, the price having increased by the start of 1951 to DM 4,300, which almost matched the price of the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]], which had itself recently undergone a substantial price reduction supported by increasing production and sales volumes.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/> 

After Champion production moved south from [[Paderborn]] to the Hennhöfer plant at [[Ludwigshafen]] the original Champion business collapsed.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>    The [[Ludwigshafen]] Hennhöfer company which was by now assembling the cars on behalf of Champion nevertheless committed to persist in producing the cars.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   The engine was switched to a 16 PS [[Heinkel]] unit, and the model name was changed from 400 to 400 H.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>    Roughly a further 1,941 of the cars were built in Ludwigshafen on this basis before Hennhöfer, in its turn, collapsed in 1953.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>

The Danish entrepreneur Thorndahl struggled to revive the business in 1953/54.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   Under his watch 1953 saw the introduction of the Champion 500G, an estate version of the car with a steel-timber body and a 452 cc Heinkel 18 PS engine.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   However, only 20 of the 500G models were produced, and in total output under Thorndahl amounted only to 300 vehicles.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>

== Maico MC 400 ==
Maico was also based in the sout-west of Germany, at [[Ammerbuch|Ammerbruch-Pfäffingen]] near [[Tübingen]]:  their purchase of the Champion assets was triggered by the low "liquidation" price at which they were available following the collapse of earlier producers of the car.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>

Following the [[Maico]] takeover the two seater car was rebranded as the Maico MC 400.  A four seater version, the Maico MC 403, was also developed by Maico's Technical Chief, Ulrich Pohl, who till then had never had any involvement in auto-design.  In order to accommodate the back seats the car was lengthened from 320 com to 340&nbsp;cm and the weight increased to 585&nbsp;kg.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   The two cylinder 400 cc engines were motor-cooled gave a stated 15 PS of output.   

1955 saw the appearance of the Maico 500 with the 452 cc Heinkel 18 PS engine.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>  The car retailed for just DM 3,665, but it is not clear whether the reduced price resulted from reductions in production costs or from ever more heroic assumptions as to the volume sales over which fixed costs could be amortized.   Bodies were by now being built by [[Karosserie Baur|Bauer]] of [[Stuttgart]].<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>  1957 saw further reworking of the chassis, but driving characteristics remained fussy: the competition had also moved on and the now aging design fell short of market expectations in terms of detailed finish and the high level of interior noise.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   Neither the two seater nor Pohl's extended four seater were strikingly beautiful.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/> 

By 1956 Maico had produced approximately a further 800 of the Champion designed cars including a further 21 of the 500G models, sold at a [[loss-leader]] price of just DM 4,050.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>

Shortly before automobile production came to an end, another sports coupe, the Maico 500 Sport Cabriolet, was shown to the public.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>  Ten pre-production prototypes were built by [[Thun]] based coach-builder [[Beutler Brothers]].<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   There were hopes of finding financial salvation by selling the little cars in the [[USA]].<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>   The hopes proved illusory, however, as the money ran out.  Early in 1958 Maeco hastily pulled out of automobile production, narrowly avoiding bankruptcy, returning the focus of their business to motor-cycles.<ref name=AutoMotorundSport197711/>  
  
By March 1958, Maico had produced about 5,000 or 7,100 of the Champion based Maico cars.   Again, sources differ.
