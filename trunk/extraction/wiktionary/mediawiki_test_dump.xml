&lt;poem&gt;
THE
GETTYSBURG
ADDRESS

[[w:1776|Fourscore and seven years ago]] our fathers brought forth
 on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and
 dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing
 whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so
 dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-
field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of
 that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave
 their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether
 fitting and proper that we should do this.
  But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate…we cannot
 consecrate…we cannot hallow…this ground. The brave men,
 living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it
 far above our poor power to add or detract. The world
 will little note nor long remember what we say here, but
 it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the
 living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
 work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
 advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the
 great task remaining before us…that from these honored
 dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
 they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here
 highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; 
 that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
 freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, 
 for the people, shall not perish from the earth. 

November 19, 1863

==The five manuscripts==
{{notes|notes=The five manuscripts transcribed below comprise a complete collection of the drafts and copies of the speech that Lincoln personally composed. They are all essentially the same, with minor differences of phrasing and punctuation.}}

===Nicolay Draft===
{{notes|notes=Lincoln gave the earliest draft to his private secretary [[w:John Nicolay|John Nicolay]].  The Nicolay copy is often called the &quot;first draft.&quot;.{{wikipediaref|Gettysburg Address}}}}

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it, as a final resting place for those who died here, that the nation might live. This we may, in all propriety do. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow, this ground—The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here; while it can never forget what they &lt;u&gt;did &lt;/u&gt;here. &lt;br /&gt;
It is rather for us, the living, &lt;s&gt;to stand here, &lt;/s&gt; we here be dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that, from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here, gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people by the people for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

===Hay Draft===
{{notes|notes=This draft was given to Lincoln's other secretary [[w:John Hay|John Hay]].  The Hay copy, which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;second draft&quot;, was made either on the morning of its delivery, or shortly after Lincoln's return to Washington.{{wikipediaref|Gettysburg Address}}}}

===Everrett Copy===
{{notes|notes=[[Author:Edward Everett|Mr. Edward Everett]] was collecting the speeches given at the Gettysburg dedication into one bound volume to sell for the benefit of stricken soldiers at New York's Sanitary Commission Fair.

===Bancroft Copy===
{{notes|notes=[[w:George Bancroft|Mr. George Bancroft]] requested this copy for inclusion in “Autograph Leaves of Our Country's Authors”, which he planned to sell at a Soldiers' and Sailors' Sanitary Fair in Baltimore.  However it was unacceptable for &quot;Autograph Leaves&quot; as it was written on both sides of the paper, and Lincoln was asked to produce a more suitable copy.{{wikipediaref|Gettysburg Address}}}}

----

&quot;The leaders who, for many years, were at the head of French armies, have formed a government. This government, alleging our armies to be undone, agreed with the enemy to stop fighting. Of course, we were subdued by the mechanical, ground and air forces of the enemy. Infinitely more than their number, it was the tanks, the airplanes, the tactics of the Germans which made us retreat. It was the tanks, the airplanes, the tactics of the Germans that surprised our leaders to the point to bring them there where they are today. 

&quot;But has the last word been said? Must hope disappear? Is defeat final? No! 

&quot;Believe me, I speak to you with full knowledge of the facts and tell you that nothing is lost for France. The same means that overcame us can bring us to a day of victory. For France is not alone! She is not alone! She is not alone! She has a vast Empire behind her. She can align with the British Empire that holds the sea and continues the fight. She can, like England, use without limit the immense industry of United States. 

&quot;This war is not limited to the unfortunate territory of our country. This war is not finished by the battle of France. This war is a world-wide war. All the faults, all the delays, all the suffering, do not prevent there to be, in the world, all the necessary means to one day crush our enemies. Vanquished today by mechanical force, we will be able to overcome in the future by a superior mechanical force. 

&quot;The destiny of the world is here. I, General de Gaulle, currently in London, invite the officers and the French soldiers who are located in British territory or who would come there, with their weapons or without their weapons, I invite the engineers and the special workers of armament industries who are located in British territory or who would come there, to put themselves in contact with me. 

&quot;Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance not must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished. Tomorrow, as today, I will speak on Radio London.&quot;

General Charles de Gaulle

 | notes    = The '''Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel''', May 14, 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), was the official announcement that a new Jewish state, named the State of Israel, had been formally established in the British Mandate of Palestine, the land where the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah had once been.

}}  
[[File:Israel Declaration of Independence.jpg|thumb|The original document of Israel's Declaration of Independence]]
[[w:Eretz-Israel|The Land of Israel]] was the birthplace of the [[w:Jew|Jewish people]]. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. Here they first attained to statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance and gave to the world the eternal [[Bible|Book of Books]]. 

After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom. 

Impelled by this historic and traditional attachment, Jews strove in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland. In recent decades they returned in their masses. Pioneers, defiant returnees, and defenders, they made deserts bloom, revived the [[w:Hebrew language|Hebrew language]], built villages and towns, and created a thriving community controlling its own economy and culture, loving peace but knowing how to defend itself, bringing the blessings of progress to all the country's inhabitants, and aspiring towards independent nationhood. 

In the year 5657 (1897), at the summons of the spiritual father of the Jewish State, [[w:Theodor Herzl|Theodore Herzl]], the First Zionist Congress convened and proclaimed the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in its own country. 

This right was recognized in the [[Balfour Declaration]] of the 2nd November, 1917, and re-affirmed in the Mandate of the League of Nations which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the Jewish people and Eretz-Israel and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home. 

The catastrophe which recently befell the Jewish people - the [[w:Holocaust|massacre of millions of Jews in Europe]] - was another clear demonstration of the urgency of solving the problem of its homelessness by re-establishing in Eretz-Israel the Jewish State, which would open the gates of the homeland wide to every Jew and confer upon the Jewish people the status of a fully privileged member of the community of nations. 

Survivors of the [[w:Nazism|Nazi]] holocaust in Europe, as well as Jews from other parts of the world, continued to migrate to Eretz-Israel, undaunted by difficulties, restrictions and dangers, and never ceased to assert their right to a life of dignity, freedom and honest toil in their national homeland. 

In the [[w:World War II|Second World War]], the Jewish community of this country contributed its full share to the struggle of the freedom- and peace-loving nations against the forces of Nazi wickedness and, by the blood of its soldiers and its war effort, gained the right to be reckoned among the peoples who founded the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]. 

On the 29th November, 1947, the United Nations [[w:UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Eretz-Israel; the General Assembly required the inhabitants of Eretz-Israel to take such steps as were necessary on their part for the implementation of that resolution. This recognition by the United Nations of the right of the Jewish people to establish their State is irrevocable. 

This right is the natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate, like all other nations, in their own sovereign State. 

Thus members and representatives of the Jews of Palestine and of the [[w:Zionism|Zionist]] movement are here assembled on the day is the termination of the British Mandate over Eretz-Yisra'el and, by virtue of our natural and historic right and on the strength of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, '''HEREBY DECLARE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JEWISH STATE IN ERETZ-YISRAEL, TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATE OF ISRAEL.'''

'''WE DECLARE''' that, with effect from the moment of the termination of the Mandate being tonight, the eve of Sabbath, the 6th Iyar, 5708 (15th May, 1948), until the establishment of the elected, regular authorities of the State in accordance with the Constitution which shall be adopted by the Elected Constituent Assembly not later than the 1st October 1948, the People's Council shall act as a Provisional Council of State, and its executive organ, the People's Administration, shall be the Provisional Government of the Jewish State, to be called '''&quot;[[w:Israel|The State of Israel]]&quot;'''.

'''THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of the Exiles'''; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

'''THE STATE OF ISRAEL is prepared to cooperate with the agencies and representatives of the United Nations''' in implementing the resolution of the General Assembly of the 29th November, 1947, and will take steps to bring about the economic union of the whole of Eretz-Israel.

'''WE APPEAL to the United Nations''' to assist the Jewish people in the building-up of its State and to receive the State of Israel into the comity of nations.

'''WE APPEAL - in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months - to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions.'''

'''WE EXTEND our hand to all neighbouring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighbourliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land.''' The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire [[w:Middle East|Middle East]].

'''WE APPEAL to the Jewish people throughout the Diaspora to rally round the Jews of Eretz-Israel''' in the tasks of immigration and upbuilding and to stand by them in the great struggle for the realization of the age-old dream - the redemption of Israel.

PLACING OUR TRUST IN THE STRENGTH OF ISRAEL*, WE AFFIX OUR SIGNATURES TO THIS PROCLAMATION AT THIS SESSION OF THE PROVISIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE, ON THE SOIL OF THE HOMELAND, IN THE CITY OF TEL-AVIV, ON THIS SABBATH EVE, THE 5TH DAY OF IYAR, 5708 (14TH MAY, 1948).

* ''Translator's Note:'' '''* The Strength of Israel (Hebrew: צור ישראל ''tzur yisra'el'', Lit. &quot;The Rock of Israel&quot; or &quot;The Fortress of Israel&quot;)''' - Also one of God's titles. The ambiguity in selecting this term was intentional. [Ami Isseroff adds - Literally it means &quot;Rock of Israel.&quot; According to Tom Segev in ''The first Israelis'' the term was selected to satisfy the demand of religious party representative Moshe Shapira, that &quot;the Lord of Israel&quot; must be mentioned in the declaration, while at the same time satisfying the objection of the leftist MAPAM party that &quot;the Lord of Israel&quot; must not be mentioned in the declaration. Ben Gurion said he could go along with that formulation, allowing the declaration to be approved before the Sabbath and before the British left the country. ]

 | notes    = '''''If—''' is a notable poem by Rudyard Kipling. It was written in 1895; the poem was first published in the Brother Square Toes chapter of Rewards and Fairies, Kipling's 1910 collection of short stories and poems. Like [[Author:William Ernest Henley|William Ernest Henley]]'s [[Invictus]], it is a memorable evocation of Victorian stoicism and the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; that popular culture has made into a traditional British virtue. Its status is both confirmed by the number of parodies it has inspired, and by the widespread popularity it still draws amongst Britons (it was voted Britain's favourite poem in a 1995 BBC opinion poll).''

''According to Kipling in his autobiography Something of Myself (1937), the poem was inspired by Dr Leander Starr Jameson, who in 1895 led a raid by British forces against the Boers in South Africa, subsequently called the Jameson Raid. This defeat increased the tensions that ultimately led to the Second Boer War. The British press, however, portrayed Jameson as a hero in the middle of the disaster, and the actual defeat as a British victory.''

&lt;poem&gt;
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same:
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools;

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: &quot;Hold on!&quot;

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Name of the project ==
Hey - I thought that the name of this project was going to be Wikisource. I own http://wikisource.org and http://wikisource.com and in the meantime will redirect those domain names here. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 06:08, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:I agree. I'd been calling it Wikisource too and I'm not keen on &quot;Project Sourceberg&quot;, but that can be fixed either through the languages.php or with the new MediaWiki namespace when it is introduced. I imagine that moving it to wikisource.org wouldn't be too difficult either. I'll lave a message for Brion about it. [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 07:45, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::I thought that there would be something like {languagecode}.wikisource.org? [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 20:41, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:::You mean, this isn't the Wikiberg project? &lt;smiles&gt; But still: If the other parts are anything to go by, it should be should be Wiki-something. I'm not sure &quot;source&quot; is right, though. Apart from the software associations the word has on the net, the implication is that one has drawn information from it. That is, an older work is only a source for a work it is used for. All other documents appear in the bibliography. Is this the intented use? (We may need a &quot;What Wikiberg &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; page.) [[oldwikisource:User:Aliter|Aliter]] 00:19, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)ccc

Wait, *wait!* This project's name should be SourceWiki, to collate automatically with every other source-related reference in people's bookmarks, favorites and lists. This is done naturally alphabetically by the first word, so that should be &quot;source.&quot; &quot;Source&quot; is the topic--people are thinking of seeing available Source text in various books, etc. Other wiki's, e.g. WardWiki, are like this. The name should not align with Wikipedia, possibly chosen to resonate with &quot;Encyclopedia.&quot; &quot;Wiki&quot; suits the water people swim in (the medium they use reflexively) better than the water they drink (&quot;I think I'll have a &quot;wiki!&quot;).

The site can stay at wikisource.org if desired. [[oldwikisource:User:Georgesawyer|Georgesawyer]] 22:49, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:I'm glad that you are not going to insist that we change direction, and that we don't need to change 36,000 articles.  I can now relax with a good stiff Scotch and Wiki. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 04:55, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)
----

== Aim of the project ==
Perhaps we already need a [[oldwikisource:What Wikisource is not]] page.  It's very new, and all discussion that I have seen about it envision it as a place for original sources.  This does not qualify it as a dumping ground for lists that some people don't want on Wikipedia.  If the lists of ZIP codes and saints are to have any value they need to stay on Wikipedia where they can be linked to the items in that list. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 08:18, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:I definitely miss the article of [[oldwikisource:What Wikisource is]] and any other pages which tell what kind of texts are to be included here (and what not), what is a ''source''; and give a definitive and obvious place to talk about it and shape its definitions if necessary. 

:For example I still have an idio^H^H^H^Hguy who is annoying us on ''HU'' that he wants to create articles about fictional things (like ''Webcone'' or the definition of ''Unarticulable future'', among other proprietary nonsense). Is wikisource is the media for him to publish his fictional ecyclopaedic material? (GFDL) (We definitely do not welcome these on the &quot;real&quot; wikipedia.) --[[oldwikisource:User:Grin|grin]] 12:19, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)
::You make a very good point.  Describing what something is not does depend a lot on what it is.  I'll pay some attention to starting a page of that sort. (I've removed the ''sp?'' from your comments; the word is correct.)
::The idiot that you describe is not uniquely Hungarian.  They exist for all languages.  I don't see Wikisource as the place for the kind of material you describe any more than Wikipedia.  I mostly see Wikisource as a series of reference texts which have usually been published somewhere else.  These texts can also include tabular material or other statistical data.  It is not a place for Wikipedians to publish books that no sane publisher would accept.  All of us would be happy to have thes fools go to somebody else's project.  In some senses Meta was devised to divert thes people, but perhaps they need their own project as a sort of asylum where they can be safely ignored. ;-) [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 18:37, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::: Although this is somewhat different, I've long thought it would be nice for there to be a &quot;dream wiki&quot; where people could create wishlists for inventions, software (both those which compare features on existing products as well as what an idealized product would be able to do), as well as an arts clearinghouse for artistic ideas (e.g., film or literature concepts) which could be shared for others to develop further, or even proposed solutions to political and social problems.  The reason I think these would be ideal for wiki format is that people could have a centralized place to find out what has been envisioned on a given topic, and even give opportunities for innovation and possibly collaboration.  Although things might get unclear where opinions could seem inherently conflicting, the primary aim would not be to delete ideas, but to organize them by topic.  This would in my view also ideally be subtly linked from Wikipedia for those wishing to find the corresponding innovation/ideas page for a given topic under research as it could be of interest to the researcher. [[oldwikisource:User:Brettz9|Brettz9]] 04:20, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Have you guys heard of project Gutenberg? How do your aims differ from theirs? There seems to be alot of overlap.  Maybe you could integrate your efforts? - Steve

:This has been discussed earlier, see [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Wikisource and Project Gutenberg]]. You are welcome to comment further on that page, if you feel that you have something to add to the discussion :) --[[oldwikisource:User:Christian S|Christian S]] 17:29, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)

What about music texts?  I'd like a repository of scores (pdf perhaps).  Is there a category for this, or another wiki, or can we make one? -- Geoff

== Languages ==
Is this like Meta, one Wiki but offical many languages. Or like Wiktionary; only English for now. For other languages there must be setup new wiki's? [[oldwikisource:User:Walter|Walter]] 08:54, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:I think it's too new to tell.  Personally, I have no problem with source texts in multiple languages, but I would wait to see how the discussions go. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 09:44, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::It would be dumb not to have it like meta. All languages should be welcome, just use naming conventions to disambiguate. Language category tags can later be used to set the language of an anon user's interface. Preferences can also be set to change the language of logged-in users. Of course this will take time to code. I still don't think there is a enough meat to this project for it to be an interesting and viable place. Why is it necessary to edit public domain texts from projects like Distributed Proofreaders? And since such editing is necessary (and in fact harmful), then what is the point? Much better just to concentrate on educationally important public domain texts and put them in Wikibooks. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 19:47, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC) 

:::I would like to put some French texts here. Do we make special Home page for each languages like http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page:Français ? [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 20:45, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::: &quot;It would be very dumb&quot; to have it like meta. All languages should be welcome, but like in Wikipedia it does not make much sense to intersperse Malayan en Gaelic documents. As you can see from the French example, the first thing to do for a new language is creating a non-general part. What sense is there in keeping these combined then? It will just cause a need for cross-translation of every project page, without adding anything. [[oldwikisource:User:Aliter|Aliter]] 00:19, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::::Sources are sources are sources. Do you intend to create your own translations? That would ''not'' be a source! What about Old or even Middle English? Should those have their own wikis as well? Where do we put the original Chaucer? Have you read the original Chaucer? It isn't what I would call English - looks more like a cross between Latin and Low German. The reason why Wikipedia is so segmented is because of naming conflicts. Articles on Albert Einstein will require that exact same title is a great many languages. Sources will be given their original title names; whatever that language is. If there happens to be a public domain translation, then that translated title would be the page name. Simple, clean and inclusive.  --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 03:15, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:::::Ok but how to have a localised menu? [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 15:44, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::::::I think localised menus are a great idea. Perhaps the current main page should be moved to [[oldwikisource:Main page:English]] and [[oldwikisource:Main page]] be made more of an international portal linking to the localised versions. [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 23:05, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:::::::Sounds good to me. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 23:06, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::::::That is going to require 1) a good category system (in the works - just some bugs to fix) 2) the creation of language category tags, 3) the ability of MediaWiki to have multiple language.php files for one wiki, 4) a user preference to set the interface language. Then anons visiting a page with a language category tag set to &quot;French&quot; will have his or her interface language change to French. A logged-in user could override that and have everything in whatever language we have language.php files for. Now we need a developer to code that. But it seems like it wouldn't be too much work once we have a functioning category system. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 23:06, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)~

::: I'm sorry to disagree, but no, sources, in the sense of that what we take data from, aren't really that different from the Wikipedia. Like Wikipedia texts, sources about Albert Einstein tend to be called &quot;Albert Einstein&quot;. And the language wikipedias have the effect of not offering Chinese pages to the Danes, which is a feature most people would want for sources as well. (Not to say no Danes read Chinese, but those that do will look for Chinese pages/sources themselves.) And yes, in the sense mentioned above, the translated version of an original can indeed be the source for articles in the language of the translation.
::: (We really do need that &quot;What is&quot;-page.) [[oldwikisource:User:Aliter|Aliter]] 04:32, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

== Everything moved from ps. ==

I probably should have clarified this yesterday, but all that happened last night is that ''all'' the articles from ps.wikipedia were moved here. This was done to clean up what ought to be Pashto Wikipedia. The movement of them here did not involve any editorial decisions and it does not reflect a view that those articles should stay here. It was just easier to get them moved in one go. Later, when we have some policies here, we can decide what needs to be done with them. Most of them have not been edited since their move here, so they all need work, if not deletion.

:Right! It wouldn't do to have the Afghans angry with us.
:There are a number of things which need to be decided - [[Project Sourceberg:What Wikisource is not]] is probably a good place to start. We also need to decide whether to stick with the name Project Sourceberg, or to go with Wikisource (or WikiSource) or something else entirely. I was assuming it was international and we already have articles in Latin, Polish, French and German, but that decision is another one which will need to be made. [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 19:24, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::The Project Sourceberg/Wikisource naming issue should be at the top of the list, before the project gets so big that a change will imply moving a lot more articles.  I very much favour the latter name as consistent with the naming conventions used on other projects.  That consistent approach will help the public to associate any &quot;wiki-xxx&quot; with the wikimedia.  Perhaps even the 9/11 project could be changed to &quot;wikimorial&quot; to leave it room to evolve into something that also honours victims of other tragedies. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 21:28, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)----

::: Agreed on priority and on the wikimorial idea, though I'm not sure about the &quot;morial&quot; bit. Alternatives? And who will have to be persuaded?) As mentioned before, I'm not sure about &quot;source&quot;. Since the open bit is already implied in &quot;wiki&quot;, can we simply be &quot;wikitext(s)&quot;? Unless we take pictures too, in which case we'd be &quot;wikimedia&quot;. Oops! [[oldwikisource:User:Aliter|Aliter]] 00:19, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::::Ditto Ec. I kinda like the &quot;Wikimorial&quot; name - at least as a working title. However beware of Working titles! &quot;Wikibooks&quot; was a working title that stuck. I would have liked &quot;Wikiveristy&quot; better (I also don't think that &quot;Wikibooks&quot; is a trademarkable name - there are many uses of that term prior to the project's founding). So it is best to have unique names. Wikisource and Wikimorial fit that bill.  --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

== Links ? ==
How to make a link to here from another Wikipedia projects? And the  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; doesn't seem to work. I added 4 articles and the cound didn't change. [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 21:22, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

== Domain names ==

http://wikisource.org and http://wikisource.com forward here now. Your ISP's DNS server may not be updated yet, however. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 06:41, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

----

Another thing that should be decided is whether this project is wanted at all. People may well have been bugging Brion for it, but on the other hand, there are still a lot of people arguing that this stuff should be on Wikipedia. The Polish Wikipedia have created a new namespace for source texts. If people are going to oppose the movement of source texts from Wikipedia to here (which they are doing at en), how is it going to work? Or should the [[en:WP:WWIN|Wikipedia is not a repository for source texts]] rule just be more strictly imposed? [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 10:49, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Does that mean such a discussion should be put on meta's current issues list? (Actually, more a discussion about all of &quot;What goes where?&quot;, judging by the remarks on this page.) [[oldwikisource:User:Aliter|Aliter]] 04:32, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC) 

----
== Speeches ==

Now that it exists, I think that this project is a more appropriate place for full speeches than Wikiquote, and that they should be moved here rather than the other way around, as suggested in a comment on the main page. [[oldwikisource:User:Kalki|Kalki]] 17:13, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:I moved the comment off the main page. They would be better here than WikiQuote I think. [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 03:35, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

----
==Multi language front page ==
Though this page has become the general (English) discussion page, this is also where I land when trying to comment explicitely on the main page:
Should the main page be single-language until we know what this Wiki will be? This would give meta-wiki the time to sort out the Wikipedia front page issue. [[oldwikisource:User:Aliter|Aliter]] 04:42, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:maybe we can add an option in preferences and let user decide which language wikisource s/he would like to see? --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 10:08, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

----
== Category ==

I think it's necessary to make the main page an index as Wikipedia does, i can hardly image when the current main page growing longer and longer! --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 10:08, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:I agree.  There has been talk at Wikipedia for some time now about introducing a category scheme which can hopefully also be adapted to this project.  A table of contents is another thing, and is probably what you meant.  The entire project will indeed become unworkable if links to every entry are on the Main Page.  The primary link will be the one created by the contributor when he begins his contribution.  This needs to be an idiot-proof system that virtually guarantees that the entry will be linked from the right place.  In some ways this is made easier by the fact that there for the immediately forseeable future, each individual contribution will have fewer links though that too will change when interwiki links are more functional.  It is made more complicated and challenging by the decision (which I accept) that there should be a single multi-language wikisource project. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 19:22, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)
----

== Page Titles ==

The naming of pages is an issue that must be addressed soon. I added 3 essays with the authors name followed by a dash and then the essay title, but now think that perhaps just the title should be used until actual conflicts arise, and then have the title followed by the authors name, or have the title followed by the author on all compositions.  I am refraining from further additions for now, and await others ideas on the matter. [[oldwikisource:User:Kalki|Kalki]] 13:12, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I see someone else has added essays with title followed by author, and I do believe this probably is the best format for all literary works and speeches. [[oldwikisource:User:Kalki|Kalki]] 13:22, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Isn't that what's doing in English Wikipedia? Unless there are some texts having the same names, we have no need to use title like '''NAME:TITLE''' IMHO. Using '''TITLE (NAME)''' would be a good idea to disambiguate the two texts with the same names. And, disambiguation pages are needed sometimes. --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 02:40, 28 Nov 2003 (UTC)
I agree to the principal entry being under the title with the author being used in the title in cases where it is necessary for disambiguation or to expand generic titles such as Poetry of ..., Essays of ..., etc. which tend to be inherently ambiguous.  A further language indicator may be needed when we have the work in several languages.  The absence of a language indicator woould tell us that the work is in its original language.

The main English page, and those for other languages, now have links to articles in that language based on a ''prima facie'' division of categories.  I think that we can easily agree that this will very soon outgrow the main page.  The Main Page should then have links to broad entry reference pages.  Ultimately every substantive contribution '''must''' link through or be traceable to one of these pages.  The first that I would want to establish is [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Authors]] for all works attributable to a personal author.  A primary division of this first level listing by genres is not helpful.  Some authors used several genres, and it is most helpful to put an authors works together in one place.  Sometimes a user may simply not be aware that a famous work is in a genre other than what he might expect.  The ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey&quot; were written in verse, but many may only be familiar with prose translations of these works.  Other top level categories will soon be evident.  I hope to say more as my ideas develop. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 02:58, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Poetry==

It would perhaps be best to create pages for each Author and only afterwards, if necessary, create seperate pages for longer works. [[oldwikisource:User:Kalki|Kalki]] ]

:I agree, and sometimes maybe we need to create separate pages for each chapter! (using slash) :) --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 02:33, 28 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Classical Texts==

I'm very new at this whole thing, and I hope I haven't misunderstood the whole purpose of this project.  But still, I was surprised that on the Main Page here there was no category for &quot;Classical Texts.&quot;  This is what I initially thought the whole project was about: allowing people to write introductions and commentaries to texts, to provide study aids, etc.  And perhaps most important of all, for primary texts that are English translations from classical languages such as Greek, Hebrew, Latin - to allow for the free update of what are largely outdated public domain translations.

Examples: Homer; classical philosophy (e.g. Aristotle), etc.

If people agree with what I've written here, then perhaps we can add a &quot;classical texts&quot; category.[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 07:20, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Yes, definitely - add it. The project only started a few days ago which is why they aren't there yet. [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 08:21, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

OK, then I'll add it.  Maybe actually in three categories:
Ancient and Classical Texts
Medieval Texts
Early Modern Texts

Would people agree to this?[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 13:41, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Wikibooks is where study aids and annotations go. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 19:16, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Wikibooks, if I understand correctly, is for ''schoolbooks'', i.e. for textbooks and for the kinds of literary texts that everybody has to buy and read in high school or college.  So Shakespeare belongs there too, because it is required reading.  And maybe other things that are often on teachers' reading lists, or for which there are Cliff notes.  But most other texts ''don't'' belong there, they belong here (again, if I have understood correctly).

How have other people understood this issue?[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 11:29, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:Yep. Although Wikibooks aims to add value to Shakespeare by adding annotation. In the future it would be real nice to be able to export the content of Wikisource's version of Shakespeare's works to Wikibooks. We already do something similar for the Wikimedia Foundation website (the source file for http://wikimediafoundation.org/fundraising is at [[meta:Wikimedia_Fundraising_page]]). That way Wikisource can concentrate on providing authoritative sources and Wikibooks can concentrate on annotating educationally significant sources (along with creating study guides and textbooks). --[[oldwikisource:User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 18:20, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I think I got it. [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 12:46, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)

If I would change something in the PD-editions of Latin texts (e.g. M. (Marcus) in stead of M'. (Manius), which is now generally accepted as correction of the Annals of Tacitus) would this violate the copyright of the authors who proposed this correction (in this case R. Syme)? Because I have mentioned in my dutch translation of the Annales references to some works that helped me with my translation([[oldwikisource:Nederlandse vertaling van de Annales#Verantwoording vertaling|1]]). It would be handy if the PD-texts can be &quot;updated&quot; to the modern interpretation of the text.--[[oldwikisource:User:Evil berry|Evil berry]]

==Top level category for treaties etc.==
I suggest a general category of &quot;Special Documents&quot; for what is now: Treaties, Pacts, Legal Texts, and Declarations.  Also: I think &quot;Essays&quot; is too general, already covered in other categories.[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 14:48, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:I will follow what you suggest, I am not an expert in this domain. [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 15:03, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I've been puzzling over this one myself.  &quot;Special&quot; seems too general, since there are many ways to be special.  My current thinking tends toward &quot;Historic documents&quot;, but I don't feel completely firm about this.  The one thing now there which I feel does not belong is the Eurovision song material which has dubious importance beside all the others.  [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 18:27, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I've done a bit more restructuring for the approach to linkage on the Main English Page.  The left half gives primary categories, and in theory every source document in Wikisource should be able to link back to the main page through one of these categories.  They have also been put into a logical order based on a series of questions in the form &quot;Does it belong here? If not go to the next question.&quot;  The final category is &quot;none of the above&quot;, which is also a default category.  Other categories may be added later when the need arises.  I still need to break off pages for some of the categories.

The right half I've called &quot;secondary indexes&quot;.  Inclusion in any of these is optional.  I don't expect to work on the remaining items here until I've finished with the left side. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 00:04, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:I agree, '''Treaties''' needs to be a major category. There are a rather lot of them, and they are quite large. I would then propose that the rest be called something like '''Documents of Governance''' being laws, constitutions and court rulings. (Humm, maybe '''Court Rulings''' would need to be a major heading someday too.)  [[[[oldwikisource:User:PaulinSaudi|PaulinSaudi]] 17:14, 1 May 2004 (UTC)]]

One of the things that I'm trying to avoid is too many top level primary categories; several that are already there should probably be moved away from there.  The reasonable argument about &quot;Treaties&quot; could be made about a lot of other things with the result that the Main Page would soon become unwieldy.  Historical documents (though a different comprehensive name could possibly be found) covers a broad range of texts, and &quot;Treaties&quot; is best treated as a sub-heading from there. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 17:44, 1 May 2004 (UTC)

==Link to Wikipedia Main Page==

Does anyone know why this English Main Page for WikiSource is ''not'' linked to the English Wikipedia Main Page?  (Under &quot;Sister Projects&quot;).  Is it possible to put it there?  (I know the Main Page is only supposed to be touched very carefully...)[[oldwikisource:User:Zabek|Zabek]] 04:31, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:I did suggest it at [[:en:talk:Main Page]] and got no reply. I shall take no reply to be agreement and try adding it. :) [[oldwikisource:User:Angela|Angela]] 22:17, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Please Note Translations ==

There's currently quite a few documents here not in the language they were written in.  These don't count in their own right as primary source document, but are instead ''translations'' of primary source documents.  Thus, they should be labeled as such, and the translator should preferably be noted (and whether the translation is an official one or not).  The [[oldwikisource:Constitution des États-Unis d'Amérique|French version of the US Constitution]] and the [[oldwikisource:The Constitution of Japan 1946|English version of the Japanese Constitution]] are two good examples.  This has two purposes: it lets people know whether a translation is ''the'' translation, or just ''a'' translation, and it lets people know that the document isn't really a primary source text in its own right. --[[oldwikisource:User:Delirium|Delirium]] 03:08, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:There's a question or whether texts translated by 'us' belong here, even with a note.  Perhaps they belong on Wikibooks in some form.  Personally, I think they should belong here, appropriately noted as you say.  This definitely needs to be clarified in [[Project Sourceberg:What Wikisource is not]] or [[Project Sourceberg:What Wikisource is]] once it's been decided.  --[[oldwikisource:User:Spikey|Spikey]] 13:50, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I have no problem with having translations of works in this project, though equally strong cases could be made for having these at Wikibooks.  My primary delineation between the two projects is that this one is for the works themselves, while Wikibooks is '''about''' the works.

We will probably have a lot of cases where the work that appears at Wikisource is not here in the original language.  As long as the fact is clearly stated that should be fine; the original can be added later.  Having the Gandhi works appear in the original Gujarati alone wouldn't help many people.  My own work on a master index has been with the distinction between originals firmly in mind.  I agree that the names of who translated something should be recorded, and if a translation is an original one by a Wikimedian that two should be recorded. An original translation by default would be subject to GFDL.  Translations are derivative works for copyright purposes, and there are many instances where the original is in the public domain, but the translation is not.

The reference to the American and Japanese constitutions is interesting.  These are only official in the languages of those countries.  No translation of them has official status; there is no such thing as '''the''' translation. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 18:20, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Hi, I believe that this translation comes from http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/funddocs/constfr.htm, so I would see it as an offical translation. [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 10:37, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:It may be an excellent translation from a reliable source, but that still does not make it &quot;official&quot; for legal purposes.  You could not go into an American court and make a legal argument about a constitutional issue based on any translation into any other language.

==Moved from my talk page==
===Changes to the English Main Page===

:''I would really appreciate it if you discussed your plans before you went ahead and started rearranging things on the English main page to suit yourself.'' -Ec

Well, it is not a [[Wikipedia:protected page|protected page]] and this is a [[Wikipedia:wiki|wiki]] after all, meaning that there is no need to discuss changes before performing them. By the way, I don't know why do you think I'm doing it to suit myself, after all, I'm giving it a more user-friendly, easy-to-access and live environment similar to [[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia's Main Page]]. Peace out, --[[oldwikisource:User:Maio|Maio]] 22:06, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:If you want we could place a vote for the different styles, I think that's the best approach. :) --[[oldwikisource:User:Maio|Maio]] 22:25, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Of course it's not a protected page, and I certainly would not support that it become a protected page in the near future.  The Wikipedia main page has been protected because it was attracting a lot of common vandals; this was making life difficult for everybody.  The simple fact that a page is not protected is not alone a valid excuse for doing something to the page that would totally change its character.  So yes you can edit it the way you want, but then so can anybody else.  That's what edit wars are made of.  

There may be no adopted rule that requires discussing a change before performing it, but doing so can be a breach of Wikiquette, especially when the page in question is fundamental to the overall operation to a major part of the project.  Whether your changes made the page more user-friendly and easier to access is debatable, and I don't know what you mean by &quot;live environment&quot;.

As for votes, no thanks!  Votes stifle consensus when the entire debate is reduced to two opposing positions.  It prevents alternative third solutions.  If you were more willing to express what is important to you in those changes, a compromise might more easily be reached.  Not all aspects of that page are equally important to me.  [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 09:24, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: As you have stated yourself, &quot;the entire debate is reduced to two opposing positions&quot;. I beleive that it is completely unnecessary to move the discussion here. Because of that, I have replied on [[oldwikisource:User talk:Eclecticology|your talk page]] instead. --[[oldwikisource:User:Maio|Maio]] 19:20, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)

'''Maio's comments on my talk page'''
: To tell you the truth, I don't understand why _you_ don't like the changes. I'm kinda tired of this childish feeling that I have by playing Sherlock Holmes with you; trying to guess out what you don't like. Right now it looks like you are circumvilating the debate, instead of attacking it already. Maybe you could be more specific and to the point? please pretty sir? :)

: You see, if you don't like a change, you should at least provide a reason of why you don't like it. Stating that you are reverting it because it is an &quot;undiscussed change&quot; or because you are &quot;restoring primary categories&quot; (when they were never removed) is kinda vague. Which, btw, makes it hard to adjust it in order to be gratifying.

: Let me try to guess what you may be looking for... *sigh* *deep breath* 

&lt;blockquote&gt;

* Index: obvious &amp; easy-to-access menu that should be at the very top of the page, right after the introduction.

* New texts: providing a living environment to the page.
** By living I mean something with a constant internal change, but with an external layout that remains the same &amp;mdash; think of the human body or the Wikipedia Main Page (especifically the &quot;Selected Articles&quot; section).

* Quick Reference Help: just a layout change, the text pretty much remains the same.
** I don't know why it is titled &quot;Primary Categories&quot; when it is indeed a &quot;Quick Reference Help&quot; (similar to Windows's Help).

* Community: providing quick reference help pages just like in the Wikipedia Main Page.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

: I don't understand why you moved this to [[oldwikisource:Talk:Main Page:English]], especially after you have expressed that this is a debate between 2 users only.

: Peace out,
: --[[oldwikisource:User:Maio|Maio]] 19:20, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)

'''Reply'''
I did not express that this was a debate between two users.  I said, &quot;Votes stifle consensus when the entire debate is reduced to two opposing positions.&quot;  Perhaps I should rephrase it to &quot;Votes stifle consensus by reducing the entire debate to two opposing position.&quot;  This is not just a matter affecting two users, but one affecting everybody's relation to the project (or at least to its English part).  Putting it on personal talk pages means that fewer people will see it.  I have nothing to hide in my views.

Yes Ashley did express preference to your version as it was at the time.  My comments at the time referred only to the &quot;coloured bullets&quot;, which I was happy to see all black.

My main concern on this page is the &quot;primary categories&quot; which I view as the top end of a site map.  I don't at all see how it can be analogous to a &quot;Windows Help&quot; page.  I would say the same thing about it as you do about the Index: &quot;obvious &amp; easy-to-access menu that should be at the very top of the page, right after the introduction.&quot;  

I mostly do not touch what is now called the &quot;Index&quot;.  Its maintenance is irregular, and its divisions are subjective.  Neverthess I avoid interfering with what people put there.

There is very little dispute about the contents of &quot;New Texts&quot; and &quot;Quick Reference Help / Community&quot;, although we may differ about their relative placements on the page.  [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 20:42, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== New format ==
''Part of the original discussion was moved to [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Scriptorium]].''

Please check out the new format of the main page in English. Btw, if we set the table width to &quot;100%&quot;, that's would be too wide; 80% is appropriate. --[[oldwikisource:User:Samuel|Samuel]] 02:51, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I've switched places between &quot;Primary Categories&quot; and &quot;Other Indexes&quot;.  Read the &quot;Top Level Category...&quot; section above for the rationale of what I'm trying to do.  I think that the headings in what has been called &quot;Index&quot; are not designed to be comprehensive.  I think that the index section can be useful for creating a lot of different specialized indexes.  I also found that reducing the overall width to 80% made the half-width sections too narrow. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 07:49, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:In terms of &quot;different specialized indexes&quot; I just moved stuff up one level.

: &lt;hr&gt;

: Tables are usually set to a full width (100%) because there are users who browse in low screen resolutions. For example, it may seem huge for someone running under 1600x1200, but for those running on 800x600, setting the width to 80% takes away a considerable amount of screen space.

: Just FYI, so that you understand the reasoning behind it: college students that use computers that are property of the campus, browse at a 800x600 resolution usually. 1600x1200 is rare (I think the last stadistic was 5%). A few years ago, the common resolution was 640x480, now it is 800x600; with 1024x768 as the next &quot;standard&quot; (at its pace, it will be the most common in less than 2 years probably).

That actually seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure if licenses themselves are copyrighted. Off course, the GPL isn't, but I'm not to sure on the MS EULA. If licenses allow it, great idea. It could be used for all sorts of comparison and research. --[[oldwikisource:User:80.57.134.174|80.57.134.174]] 10:42, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Primary Categories Section ==

This should not be in question/answer form with a section for each question, it just ends up repeating the same phrase over and over, and overcompicating the view of the front page.  Probably would look nicer delimited by &quot;--&quot; like in wikipedia, or just as a bulleted list.

As a side note, it might be nice to add a &quot;Featured text&quot; or something to make good use of the front page, while still linking to the categories.

== Mathematical Vs. Numerical ==

I think it is misleading that the question asks whether is mathematical when really it is referring to being numerical. I think the page should be changed to numerical rather than mathematical. For example, I don't think Euclid's elements would fall under that category even though it may be purely mathematical.
--[[oldwikisource:User:Cronian|Cronian]] 06:23, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)
:I understand your point.  What I like about &quot;mathematical&quot; is that it is a broader term, despite the fact that the subject has been dominated by numerical charts and tables.

== Public Patents? ==

I wouldn't myself be inclined to develop these pages (as I'd have no idea what to do about it), but I noticed that the category of public patents (if such things exist, as I have heard they do), would be a nice, logical addition to this site and set of sites.

:::Thanks for pointing out your earlier comments; I had not noticed them before.  Your idea is certainly interesting and with tremendous possibilities.  Admittedly life on the Wiki has made me far more familiar with copyright law than with patent law.  Perhaps too the fact that I recently acquired the book, ''the smoking gun'' may have put me in an unfair mood.  It mentions such things as U.S. Patent 5,472,399, &quot;An apparatus for exercising the penis&quot;, and Patent 5,934,226, &quot;A diaper for pet birds&quot;.  

:::I have no problem supporting the principle that you express; it is certainly visionary.  I still don't know what the right wiki project would be for it, but ultimately, once it gets off the ground, it would deserve a project of its own. I have always maintained that the public domain signifies not an absence of ownership, but an ownership by the public.  Patents have a much shorter lifespan than copyritghts.  Henson's 1842 patent of the airfoil was well into the public domain but the time the Wright Brothers were ready for their first flight.  I guess my point with that is that a free patent regime depends far more on what has gone before than is the case with open copyrights.  Patents need to be reviewed before being granted, and, at least in theory, that includes checking to see if the idea duplicates a previously patented idea.  I think that there is a lot of room for challenging some patents, but unless the challenger personally has a vested interest it just won't happen.  Would the previous invention of a poop bag for dogs have prevented the patent of the bird diaper that I mentioned. Also, the fact that something is patented does not prevent you from using the description to make a model for your own use; it only prevents you from marketting the product and using it to derive profit.   

:::To be successful this idea must emphasize what people can do for themselves.  I am curious about what message they are trying to communicate in a TV ad when they describe their product as &quot;patented&quot;.  How is that possibly going to make that product work better, or be better suited for its purpose?  What con game are they playing?  What are the ingredients in a can of commercial paint thinner that you get at a hardware store?  Leaving aside questions of poisons and carcinogens, is there something that I could mix myself for a lot cheaper that could do the job more easily?  I hope you get my point. :-)  I seem to be ranting on in the gospel of self-reliance.  Consumerism relies on personal incompetance, including the inability of the average man-of-the-house to perform the most elementary of household repairs.  Public patents that provide a practical guide to overcoming this defect could be very welcome. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 19:56, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Changes to layout ==

[[oldwikisource:User:AaronSw|AaronSw]]'s changes were rightly reverted since they were quite radical and not discussed beforehand at all.  I think the [[oldwikisource:Main Page]] is great the way it is and I wasn't a fan of what he did to the Author template either, but I did like [http://wikisource.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Main_Page:English&amp;oldid=15594 his way] of organizing the English Main Page.  Therefore I would like to discuss if we could organize the categories the way he did: i.e. more succinctly and structured.  Personally I think it gives the reader more options to find what they want faster.  Obviously he didn't go about it the right way but anyone else agree that the English Main page looked better the new way? - [[oldwikisource:User:Biggins|Biggins]] 11:01, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:The intent in structuring the English Main Page the way that it is was based on a decision tree that would allow the placement of any article.  At least the left half has been that way.  It allows any and all articles to be traced back to the Main Page.  (I've taken very little interest in the right half, even though I've noticed that some of the new articles remain new for a very long time.)  The thinking behind it has you begin at the top of the list, ask the question, and if the answer is yes put the article under that heading; if no go on to the next question.  At the end of the series of questions you reach &quot;none of the above&quot;.  I admit that I have been remiss in properly documenting that process.  The word &quot;categories&quot; at the head of that box was there long before the current category system was devised, and may now be misleading. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 20:13, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::This kind of decision tree would be more appropriate on a &quot;how to add an article&quot; page. People want to find articles in all sorts of ways, and the front page should be geared to them.

:::OK now I know what the questions were for, I never understood :)  But as Aaronsw says, a decision tree would probably be more appropriate on something like the [[How to submit a text]] page, while a more index-like layout would be better for the main page in my opinion.  And really, the substance doesnt really change much: the proposed version contains all the links that are on the current version, only organized differently and adding links to category-like pages ([[Wikisource:Letters|Letters]], [[Wikisource:Poetry|Poetry]] etc).  All pages could still be traced back to the Main Page, in fact more of them (the category-like pages) could.

:::As for the misleading categories header, I agree its a bit outdated.  I for one completely forgot about [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Poetry|the poetry page]] when I added [[oldwikisource:The Hunting of the Snark]], I just listed it from Lewis Carroll's author page and thought I was done.  Linking to a document from multiple places like that seems annoying and unnecessary: shouldn't we make those true categories so we can just put a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Poetry]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; link on a page? - [[oldwikisource:User:Biggins|Biggins]] 00:13, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::::Ooh boy, just went back and read through the whole discussion about categories at the scriptorium.  So are we officially using the Library of Congress system or what?  I'm kinda confused about the whole issue. - [[oldwikisource:User:Biggins|Biggins]] 00:29, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::Relegating something to a &quot;How to add an article&quot; page would be a ticket to oblivion.  There is plenty of room for both approches on the English Main Page; that has always been the case.  The most important feature about the &quot;Primary categories&quot; (and I'm now considering changing that title to &quot;Primary links&quot;) is that it is comprehensive, ''i.e.'' absolutely every article can be linked through it.  No-one is obliged to link from multiple places; linking from an author page is quite sufficient.  If someone wants to make an additional link from the poetry page they are welcome to do it, though eventually any good category system should make such pages based on genre redundant.  My suggestion at this point would be for those who want change to develop the right side of the page to their satisfaction.  I'm not likely to take a significant role in that exercise.  When that is done, perhaps we can better co-ordinate our different efforts.

::There is nothing obligatory or even &quot;official&quot; about using the Library of Congress Classification System (LC).  Nor is there anything to prevent or forbid multiple category systems.  Nevertheless, if someone wants to start another coded system they would do well to insure that all their categories are clearly identified as being from that system.  To the extent that the LC system is used here, it has already been much modified, and has thus only served as a general guideline for a coded structure.  To make a long story short, a significant part of the rationale for a coded system was to enable &quot;categories&quot; or &quot;subjects&quot; in multiple languages that would redirect to a common code.  Thus &quot;poetry&quot;, &quot;poésie&quot;, &quot;poesia&quot;, etc. could all redirect to Class &quot;PNE&quot;. [[oldwikisource:User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 08:42, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:I'm a believer in trying things out myself to get other people interested in them. If I make mistakes, people are inspired by learning from them. If I happen to possibly have a good idea, people are inspired to take that into account and improve upon it with their own ideas. It was for that reason that I've spent a couple of fun hours working on [[oldwikisource:User:Icurite:Mainpage|my attempt at a main page]] while I surfed around the place. Hopefully, both the strengths and more likely the weaknesses of my design will inspire some further discussion and possibly even some action.

I do strongly feel, however, that categories need to be used more. Just like I add uncategorized articles to categories at Wikipedia, I also do the same here. And I also agree with another comment I read on this talk page that the Main Page needs to become more of a general internet resource rather than a contributor's resource. [[oldwikisource:User:Icurite|Icurite]]

== External linking ? ==
I have a question about linking out to outside pages where sources are stored.
Can we put links to the sites with these sources or do we only allow for WikiSource stored content? 
I understand that we would like to make the texts available on WikiSource site. This way anybody can access them right here. But then there are thousands of texts which are available to read and download but have restrictions as far as publishing is concerned.

One example is the University of Virginia electronic resources. There are great many etexts there but the publisher does not allow for them to be re-published without permision (see http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/conditions.html ).

But instead of taking their etexts and publishing them on WikiSource, we could of course create links to good sources where the etexts are kept.

To give you one example: I added a book for WikiSource author [[oldwikisource:Author:Horatio Alger|Horatio Alger]], [[oldwikisource:Ragged Dick, or, Street Life in New York]]. This link, instead of leading to the text on WikiSource, directs to Virginia University collection. You might say that it is better to have the text on Wiki. But then some texts are not available because of copywright reasons. Directing to external sources allows us to have authors' collection more complete. 

What do you think?  ([[oldwikisource:User:Aiks|Aiks]] 18:55, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC))

:When dealing with issues of this sort one needs to distinguish between what is not allowed, and what is merely not recommended.  Clear violations of copyright without adequate justification should clearly not be allowed.  Duplicating material that is easily found elsewhere is not recommended.  In general I have no problem with linking, but I would find it useless and disappointing if the '''only''' work that we mentioned by an author linked to an outside source. 
 
:Alger was a prolific author, and you are obviously interested in his work.  Your point about having a more complete collection is absolutely valid.  Developing a good bibliography of his works on the author page certainly fits well with my own vision of this project.  Researching the availability of material is a part of bibliographic work, and UVa texts do tend to be in a format that is consistent with the way we would like to present things to our readers.  Contrast this with those sites that have pdf files, or images, or are non-searchable, or filled with ads.  Of course, if we want to do more than carry a bare text, adding such features as links to Wiktionary, having the text in our databse would be essential... but were not there ... yet.

:As to UVa's Terms of Use, I find much of what they say to be ''ultra vires''.  They have no way of legally preventing you from using that part of their texts which is already in the public domain.  Their scanning and proofreading work is not copyrightable.  Some of their added material may be, but we're not interested in that anyway.

==Logo suggestion==
See: [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Revising the &quot;Sourceberg&quot; logo]]



==Index should be given top priority==

As this is supposed to be a resource for everyone, not just for contributors, I think the index should be the first thing you see on the main page. [[oldwikisource:User:82.35.37.118|82.35.37.118]] 14:42, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Original works ==

It says in [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:What is Wikisource?]] that original writings are excluded from wikisource.  Since Wikibooks is for textbooks, does that mean that if I want to release an essay under the GFDL, it wouldn't be welcomed here? -[[oldwikisource:User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]] 17:43, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:Hi, If it is some work written in University (thesis, etc.), it is accepted as we consider that is published work. Otherwise what is the subject of your essay ? [[oldwikisource:User:Yann|Yann]] 18:55, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::Thanks for your response.  I wasn't talking about a specific essay, I just have a few essays on my computer that I would be willing to GFDL; but it wasn't a university paper, just an old highschool assignment.  I'm not very familiar with how things work on wikisource...would it be beneficial to submit it? Would others be able to edit my work? I do a lot of stuff on Wikipedia, but I'm not too familiar with wikisource, so please excuse my ignorance! -[[User:Frazzydee|[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]]]] 19:27, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::When it comes to what should be posted here on Wikisource, we really only want things that have been published in the past.  For example, books, speeches, journal articles, are good things to start with--we want things that have been made widely available to the public.  In your case, it would not be advised to submit those essays here.  We've had Wikisource users submit their own writings before, and each entry has been deleted.  The same would happen in your case, too.  If you would like to publish your essays, I advise another place, such as [http://www.fictionpress.com FictionPress.com].  That site is more designed for what you want, and there are ways for you to attract people to read the essays you post there, also.  [[oldwikisource:User:Zhaladshar|Zhaladshar]] 22:57, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Papal encyclicals ==

were should those go?

:There is already a page dedicated to those at [[oldwikisource:Catholic Church Encyclicals]].  These are located at [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Religious texts#Christian Theological and Ecclesiastical Documents]].  [[oldwikisource:User:Zhaladshar|Zhaladshar]] 12:23, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Legendary sagas==
I had intended to include some legendary sagas from Norse mythology, but I am not sure of in which category they belong. Most of them have some historic basis, but they are mixed with fiction.--[[oldwikisource:User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 08:29, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:I think the sagas are a wonderful idea.  I've added a couple myself.  If they have an author, then they go on the author's page.  Otherwise, the best place to put them is at [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:Anonymous texts]].  [[oldwikisource:User:Zhaladshar|Zhaladshar]] 12:23, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)


==World Wide School==

A link to this site could be made, as it has a number of useful texts:

== Moving &quot;Community&quot; section to the &quot;Community portal&quot; page? ==

Thought I'd check if there was a good reason why this hasn't be done. The community portal section '''A)''' is below the fold '''B)''' has content more appropriate for the under-developed &quot;Community portal&quot; page. I think the community portal page is very undeveloped considering the continued growth of Wikisource. I know the community page does not the need quite the scale and size of the Wikipedia version (and to be honest I don't think the WP page it's very usable unless you're used to it), but does anyone object to some general improvements of the CP page, perhaps containing some of the main page community links? [[oldwikisource:User:GregRobson|GregRobson]] 8 July 2005 17:50 (UTC)

:Yes, the community portal is definitely underdeveloped. I don't think anybody would mind if you start to work on it, just go ahead. --[[oldwikisource:User:Christian S|Christian S]] 8 July 2005 19:30 (UTC)

::Please, go right ahead!  It keeps me from having to track it all down and do it myself :).  I do think we need to make a lot more use of the Community Portal (although it wasn't until recently that we revamped what it currently is).  But by all means, go ahead and work on it!  {{User:Zhaladshar/sig}} 8 July 2005 19:32 (UTC)

The changes have been made, and therefore the Community Portal [[oldwikisource:Wikisource talk:Community Portal|talk page]] should be used for discussion on that. The respective (yellow) section has been amended and the language information moved to the bottom like the 'pedia version. I still think this page could be improved, but it's almost midnight here and it would probably be better if I slept on my ideas! [[oldwikisource:User:GregRobson|GregRobson]] 8 July 2005 22:54 (UTC)

----

I think there ought to be at least some very small section on the front page that links to fundimental and frequently used areas, like the Community Portal page and perhaps the Scriptorium.  This is common on most Wikimedia project front pages, but is currently missing here.  Still, I like the idea of using the Community portal more strongly than it typical is done.  Otherwise it is totally confusing for a new user just trying to figure things out (even though &quot;Community Portal&quot; is listed as a part of the &quot;navigation&quot; bar for most skin types.)  [[oldwikisource:User:Robert Horning|Robert Horning]] 9 July 2005 18:12 (UTC)

==Translations of Opera Libretti==

I propose a project called Wikisource Opera, where the original libretti of the operas can be accompanied by translations into a number of other languages.  This will be useful, because no project of this sort is available on the internet, and because a number of record companies release recordings without the original translations and/or libretti. [[oldwikisource:User:165.21.154.117|165.21.154.117]] 17:17, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
* Sounds good, you might want to start a [[oldwikisource:Wikisource:WikiProject|WikiProject]] here for it, and see you can get others involved. It certainly sounds like this sort of resource is needed. [[oldwikisource:User:GregRobson|Greg Robson]] 14:21, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

== 25,000 ==

there are now 25,00 article wikisource, this great and shouldn't fall by the wayside without comment.

== Other languages logo ==

I'm not sure what to do about it, but [[:Image:Other-langs2.png|Other-langs2.png]] on the main page seems awfully chunky today... Could someone far more powerful than I handle this? [[oldwikisource:User:Lusanaherandraton|Lusanaherandraton]] 13:01, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

}}

We are here in the middle hour of our grief. So many have suffered so great a loss,
and today we express our nation's sorrow. We come before God to pray for the
missing and the dead, and for those who loved them. 

On Tuesday, our country was attacked with deliberate and massive cruelty. We have
seen the images of fire and ashes and bent steel. Now come the names, the list of
casualties we are only beginning to read.

They are the names of men and women who began their day at a desk or in an
airport busy with life. They are the names of people who faced death and in their last
moments called home to say, &quot;Be brave&quot; and &quot;I love you.&quot; They are the names of
passengers who defied their murderers and prevented the murder of others on the
ground. They are the names of men and women who wore the uniform of the United
States and died at their posts. They are the names of rescuers, the ones whom death
found running up the stairs and into the fires to help others. 

We will read all these names, we will linger over them and learn their stories, and
many Americans will weep. To the children and parents and spouses and families
and friends of the lost, we offer the deepest sympathy of the nation. 

And I assure you, you are not alone. Just three days removed from these events,
Americans do not yet have the distance of history, but our responsibility to history is
already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been waged
against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when
stirred to anger. 

This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way and at
an hour of our choosing. Our purpose as a nation is firm, yet our wounds as a
people are recent and unhealed and lead us to pray.

In many of our prayers this week, there is a searching and an honesty. At St.
Patrick's Cathedral in New York on Tuesday, a woman said, &quot;I pray to God to give
us a sign that he's still here.&quot; Others have prayed for the same, searching hospital to
hospital, carrying pictures of those still missing. God's signs are not always the ones
we look for. We learn in tragedy that his purposes are not always our own.

Yet the prayers and private suffering, whether in our homes or in this great cathedral,
are known and heard and understood. There are prayers that help us last through the
day or endure the night. There are prayers of friends and strangers that give us
strength for the journey. And there are prayers that yield our will to a will greater
than our own. 

This world he created is of moral design. Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a
time. Goodness, remembrance and love have no end. And the Lord of life hold all
who die and all who mourn. 

It is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves. This is true of a nation, as well. In
this trial, we have been reminded, and the world has seen, that our fellow Americans
are generous and kind, resourceful and brave. We see our national character in
rescuers working past exhaustion, in long lines of blood donors, in thousands of
citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way possible.

And we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice. Inside the
World Trade Center, one man who could have saved himself stayed until the end at
the side of his quadriplegic friend. A beloved priest died giving the last rites to a
firefighter. Two office workers, finding a disabled stranger, carried her down 68
floors to safety. A group of men drove through the night from Dallas to Washington
to bring skin grafts for burn victims. 

In these acts and many others, Americans showed a deep commitment to one another
and an abiding love for our country. 

Today we feel what Franklin Roosevelt called the &quot;warm courage of national unity.&quot;
This is the unity of every faith and every background. It has joined together political
parties in both houses of Congress. It is evident in services of prayer and candlelight
vigils, and American flags which are displayed in pride and wave in defiance. Our
unity is a kinship of grief and a steadfast resolve to prevail against our enemies. And
this unity against terror is now extending across the world. 

America is a nation full of good fortune, with so much to be grateful for; but we are
not spared from suffering. In every generation, the world has produced enemies of
human freedom. They have attacked America because we are freedom's home and
defender. And the commitment of our fathers is now the calling of our time. 

On this national day of prayer and remembrance, we ask almighty God to watch over
our nation and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come. We pray that he
will comfort and console those who now walk in sorrow. We thank him for each life
we now must mourn and the promise of a life to come. 

As we've been assured: Neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth can separate us
from God's love. May he bless the souls of the departed, may he comfort our own,
and may he always guide our country. 

God bless America.

&quot;Thank You, Commissioners:

My name is Ryan White. I am sixteen years old. I have hemophilia, and I have AIDS.

When I was three days old, the doctors told my parents I was a severe hemophiliac, meaning my blood does not clot. Lucky for me, there was a product just approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It was called Factor VIII, which contains the clotting agent found in blood.

While I was growing up, I had many bleeds or hemorhages in my joints which make it very painful. Twice a week I would receive injections or IV's of Factor VIII which clotted the blood and then broke it down. A bleed occurs from a broken blood vessel or vein. The blood then had nowhere to go so it would swell up in a joint. You could compare it to trying to pour a quart of milk into a pint-sized container of milk.

The first five to six years of my life were spent in and out of the hospital. All in all I led a pretty normal life. Most recently my battle has been against AIDS and the discrimination surrounding it. On December 17, 1984, I had surgery to remove two inches of my left lung due to pneumonia. After two hours of surgery the doctors told my mother I had AIDS. I contracted AIDS through my Factor VIII which is made from blood. When I came out of surgery, I was on a respirator and had a tube in my left lung. I spent Christmas and the next thirty days in the hospital. A lot of my time was spent searching, thinking and planning my life.

I came face to face with death at thirteen years old. I was diagnosed with AIDS: a killer. Doctors told me I'm not contagious. Given six months to live and being the fighter that I am, I set high goals for myself. It was my decision to live a normal life, go to school, be with my friends, and enjoying day to day activities. It was not going to be easy.

The school I was going to said they had no guidelines for a person with AIDS. The school board, my teachers, and my principal voted to keep me out of the classroom even after the guidelines were set by the I.S.B.H., for fear of someone getting AIDS from me by casual contact. Rumors of sneezing, kissing, tears, sweat, and saliva spreading AIDS caused people to panic.

We began a series of court battles for nine months, while I was attending classes by telephone. Eventually, I won the right to attend school, but the prejudice was still there. Listening to medical facts was not enough. People wanted one hundred percent guarantees. There are no one hundred percent guarantees in life, but concessions were made by Mom and me to help ease the fear. We decided to meet them halfway:

* Separate restrooms
* No gym
* Separate drinking fountains
* Disposable eating utensils and trays

Even though we knew AIDS was not spread through casual contact. Nevertheless, parents of twenty students started their own school. They were still not convinced. Because of the lack of education on AIDS, discrimination, fear, panic, and lies surrounded me:

* I became the target of Ryan White jokes
* Lies about me biting people
* Spitting on vegetables and cookies
* Urinating on bathroom walls
* Some restaurants threw away my dishes
* My school locker was vandalized inside and folders were marked FAG and other obscenities

I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I was not welcome anywhere. People would get up and leave so they would not have to sit anywhere near me. Even at church, people would not shake my hand.

This brought on the news media, TV crews, interviews, and numerous public appearances. I became known as the AIDS boy. I received thousands of letters of support from all around the world, all because I wanted to go to school. Mayor Koch, of New York, was the first public figure to give me support. Entertainers, athletes, and stars started giving me support. I met some of the greatest like Elton John, Greg Louganis, Max Headroom, Alyssa Milano (my teen idol), Lyndon King (Los Angeles Raiders), and Charlie Sheen. All of these plus many more became my friends, but I had very few friends at school. How could these people in the public eye not be afraid of me, but my whole town was?

It was difficult, at times, to handle; but I tried to ignore the injustice, because I knew the people were wrong. My family and I held no hatred for those people because we realized they were victims of their own ignorance. We had great faith that with patience, understanding, and education, that my family and I could be helpful in changing their minds and attitudes around. Financial hardships were rough on us, even though Mom had a good job at G.M. The more I was sick, the more work she had to miss. Bills became impossible to pay. My sister, Andrea, was a championship roller skater who had to sacrifice too. There was no money for her lessons and travel. AIDS can destroy a family if you let it, but luckily for my sister and me, Mom taught us to keep going. Don't give up, be proud of who you are, and never feel sorry for yourself.

After two and a half years of declining health, two attacks of pneumocystis, shingles, a rare form of whooping cough, and liver problems, I faced fighting chills, fevers, coughing, tiredness, and vomiting. I was very ill and being tutored at home. The desire to move into a bigger house, to avoid living AIDS daily, and a dream to be accepted by a community and school, became possible and a reality with a movie about my life, The Ryan White Story.

My life is better now. At the end of the school year (1986-87), my family and I decided to move to Cicero, Indiana. We did a lot of hoping and praying that the community would welcome us, and they did. For the first time in three years, we feel we have a home, a supportive school, and lots of friends. The communities of Cicero, Atlanta, Arcadia, and Noblesville, Indiana, are now what we call &quot;home.&quot; I'm feeling great. I am a normal happy teenager again. I have a learner's permit. I attend sports functions and dances. My studies are important to me. I made the honor roll just recently, with 2 A's and 2 B's. I'm just one of the kids, and all because the students at Hamilton Heights High School listened to the facts, educated their parents and themselves, and believed in me.

I believe in myself as I look forward to graduating from Hamilton Heights High School in 1991.

Hamilton Heights High School is proof that AIDS EDUCATION in schools works.&quot;</text>

==PROTEST==

In the [[w:Warsaw Ghetto|Warsaw Ghetto]], behind walls separating it from the outside world, several hundred thousand condemned are awaiting death. There is no hope for any rescue, no help comes. Streets are patrolled by executioners who fire at anyone who dares to leave his house. They also fire at anyone standing by the windows. On the pavements rot unburied human corpses.

Daily shipments as ordered by the authorities are set at 8-10 thousand victims. Jewish policemen are ordered to deliver them into the hands of the German executioners. If they fail, they will be killed. Children unable to walk by themselves are loaded on wagons. The loading process is so cruel that only a small number of them reaches the railway platform alive. Mothers witnessing this go mad. The number of those insane from despair and horror equals the number of those shot down.

There are railcars waiting at the platform. The executioners are forcibly packing over 150 captives in each one. Thick layers of lime and chlorine are put on the floor of railcars and splashed with water. The doors of the railcar are securely bolted. Trains sometimes start immediately after the load; sometimes, however, they wait one or two days on the side rails... No one cares. Of the people packed so densely that the dead cannot fall down and are standing arm to arm with the living, of the people dying of the lime and chlorine gases, without air, a drop of water, without food - no one will survive.  These death-trains, whenever and wherever they arrive will bring only dead bodies.

Confronted with such suffering, quick death would be preferable. The executioners have foreseen this. All pharmacies in the ghetto have been closed to prevent the purchase of poison. There are no guns. The only solution is to jump out of a window onto the street. Thus many convicts have chosen to &quot;escape&quot; their executioners.

What happens in the Warsaw Ghetto, has been happening for half a year in hundreds of smaller or larger Polish towns and cities. The total number of the murdered has already exceeded one million and the number grows each day. All perish. Poor and rich, old, women, men, youngsters, infants, Catholics dying with the name of Jesus and Mary together with Jews. Their only guilt is that they were born Jewish condemned to extermination by Hitler.

The world looks on at these atrocities, more horrible than anything history has seen, and is silent. The slaughter of millions of people continues in ominous silence. The executioners are silent; they do not boast about their deeds. England is silent, so is America; even international Jewry is silent, usually so sensitive to any harm done to their people. Silent are the Poles. The Polish political allies of the Jews limit themselves to journalistic notes; the Polish opponents of Jews show no interest in a matter that is foreign to them. Dying Jews are surrounded only by Pilates washing their hands. Silence should not be tolerated any more. If for no other reason — it is contemptible.  Who is silent in the face of murder - becomes a partner of the murderer.  Who does not condemn - approves.

We, Catholic Poles, take a stance. Our feelings toward the Jews have not changed. We do not stop thinking about them as the political, economic and ideological enemies of Poland. Moreover we do realize that they still hate us more than the Germans, that they make us co-responsible for their misfortune. Why? On what basis? This remains the secret of the Jewish soul. Nevertheless, this is a fact that is continuously confirmed. Awareness of those feelings, doesn't relieve us from '''the duty to condemn the crime.'''

We do not want to be Pilates. We have no power to actively prevent German murders, we cannot help, we cannot save anyone, but we '''protest''' from the bottom of our hearts overwhelmed with mercy, fury and horror. We are required by God to protest, God who forbids us to kill. Our Christian consciousness demands this. Every human being has the right to be loved by his fellow man. The blood of the defenceless cries to heaven for revenge. Those who oppose our protest - are not Catholics.

Being Polish, we also protest. We do not believe that Poland can benefit from German cruelties. On the contrary. The continuing silence of international Jewry, the German propaganda that tries, even now, to place the blame for the slaughter of the Jews on Lithuanians and... Poles, we sense a plot of the enemy against us.  We also know how poisoned is the fruit of the crime. The role of forced observer in the bloody spectacle taking place on Polish soil might promote indifference to pain and suffering and what is the most important, conviction that to murder your neighbour without any punishment is permisssible.

Those who do not understand this and would associate the proud and free future of Poland with contentment in the grief of his '''fellow man''', is neither a Catholic nor a Pole.

==&quot;U.S. Middle East Policy&quot;==
===Oil===

The core issue in the Middle East is very straightforward, namely oil.  Since WWI, when the world began to move onto an oil-based economy, the Middle East has become central in world affairs, for the very obvious reason that it has, by far the largest and the most accessible petroleum resources— primarily in Saudi Arabia, secondarily in Iraq, and thirdly in the Gulf Emirates, and elsewhere. It is, as the State Department described it during the Second World War, when the US was taking over:  &quot;It's a stupendous source of strategic power and the greatest material prize in world history.&quot;  &quot;It's strategically the most important part of the world&quot;, as the president of Columbia University described it, as he was making his transition from Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe to supreme commander of the world in the White House.  Which, I guess, says something about Columbia’s rank in the world order. (Laughs)

The smaller, more expensive reserves like North Sea and Alaska are declining. The role of the Middle East in the world energy system is accordingly increasing. And it will become critical probably in the not-too-distant future if, as is widely anticipated, the current oil glut proves to be temporary, which is not unlikely  the rate of discovery has been declining since the 1960s despite high technology, deep sea drilling, and so on. And the usage of energy is sharply increasing. In fact, about half of the total usage since the oil price rise in the early ’70s and it’s going up. It's expected that the magical halfway point is— what it’s called when half of the known accessible resources are used, is coming fairly soon. All of this spells prices. It’s possible of course, that some unpredictable breakthrough will take place and things will change, but policy planning is not based upon unpredictable technological breakthroughs. So, we can pretty confidently expect that the US will continue, as in the past to do everything that it can to make sure that the &quot;greatest material prize in world history&quot; remains firmly in its hands.

===US Control===

Well, the US took over from Britain in the Middle East and, in fact, much of the world, after the Second World War.  In fact actually, replaced Britain and France.  France was summarily expelled— they weren't given the time of day.  Britain however, was given a role. It was given the role of &quot;junior partner&quot;, as the British foreign office rather ruefully described it, accurately.  Britain was going to be our lieutenant— the fashionable word is &quot;partner&quot;— as they were described by a senior adviser in the Kennedy administration.  That's reasonably accurate— you’re seeing an example of it right now.  The lieutenant is doing its job— the attack-dog, maybe.

The United States took over from— inherited from Britain, the modalities of control over the region as well.  These modalities had changed during and after WWI, when Britain no longer had the force to rule the Empire directly by occupation, and therefore had to turn to airpower and high technology— advanced technology. So, it was explained pretty frankly. The distinguished statesman Lloyd George was commenting on Britain's success in undermining a disarmament conference— which would have barred the use of airpower against civilians.  He pointed out that it was a success because, as he put it:  &quot;We have to reserve the right to bomb the niggers.&quot;  Which kind of sums up world affairs rather nicely.

Winston Churchill, who was then the Secretary of State at the British War Office, was a great enthusiast for using advanced technology to achieve the same end. His favorite was poison gas. He said (back in the early ‘20s) that: &quot;Poison gas would be a fine weapon against uncivilized tribesmen and recalcitrant Arabs.&quot; That's referring to Kurds and Afghans at the time — but they apparently qualify. (Laughs) He said that: &quot;It should inspire a lively terror.&quot; You should recall that using poison gas was called the &quot;ultimate atrocity&quot; in those days. And he said it was simply the use of — the application of Western science to military warfare— to measures of warfare, and therefore, we shouldn't back off from it. Well, those were the military tactics— they've had a distinguished career ever since.

===Modalities of Control===

On the political side, Britain— (we know from the British Foreign Office records— Colonial Office records, which have been declassified)— they developed a system, which in fact the US has taken over. The idea was, the oil-producing states would be administered by what the British called— secretly of course— what they called an &quot;Arab façade&quot;— constitutional fictions behind which Britain would continue to rule. Now the façade has to be weak, because it has to be dependable. It has to do what you tell it. But then, there's a problem: If the façade is weak, it may not be able to control its own population, and its own population is ‘uncivilized and ignorant.’ They ‘do not understand.’ They 'can be easily infected' by what is called &quot;a virus of radical nationalism.&quot; Which was defined by the State Department back in the 1940s as: &quot;the belief that the first beneficiaries of a country’s resources ought to be the people of that country.&quot; (Laughs)

That, of course, is intolerable because ‘any sane and civilized person’ can understand that the ‘&quot;first beneficiaries of a country's resources&quot; have to be wealthy investors in the United States,’ and so on. ‘These people just don't understand that’ and ‘they're always causing trouble’— ‘They’re uncivilized tribesmen,’ and so on... and ‘sometimes poison gas doesn't work...’ (Laughs) So you have to have some way of keeping the &quot;Arab façade&quot; in power. And to do that, the US developed the system; there are two kinds of violence required. Actually, this is all over the world. Much of the history of the last half-century is the playing out of this issue; in Southeast Asia and Latin America, and all over the world. It's not put that way, but that's the way it is.

In the Middle East, the way it was worked out, is that there are to be what the Nixon administration called &quot;local cops on the beat&quot; that is, local gendarmes who sort of keep order in the neighborhood. And it's best to have them be non-Arab 'cause they're better at killing &quot;recalcitrant Arabs&quot;. So there's a periphery of— in fact, what David Ben Gurion, Israeli Prime Minister, called— the &quot;periphery policy&quot;, of non-Arab states—Iran (under the Shah), Turkey, Israel, Pakistan. There they are to be the ‘local cops on the beat,’ but the understanding of course, is that ‘police headquarters’ remains in Washington. And if things really get out of hand— the ‘local cops on the beat’ can't handle it— there’s British and US muscle in reserve to be used when needed. That's essentially the modality of control.

===Intervention===

The Central Command, as its now called, which was initiated by Carter as the Rapid Deployment Force— is the major US intervention force in the world, by far. And it's an enormous force— it's based from Guam to the Azores. It even has bases in the Indian Ocean, where a &quot;junior partner&quot; was kind enough to drive out the population of an island, so that US bases could be put there— all aimed at the core area. In 1980, when the Carter administration was explaining this to Congress, they pointed out the problem wasn't the Russians— this was after the invasion of Afghanistan. The problem was &quot;regional unrest,&quot; which is the &quot;virus of radical nationalism.&quot; And that remains the case. So as for the Russians, ‘we don't have to argue about that anymore.’

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Bush administration— in a very important and therefore unreported, (Laughs) declaration to Congress— explained to Congress that everything had to remain exactly the same— same military budget  — everything. Including intervention forces, aimed at the Middle east where, as they put it: &quot;The threat to our interests could not be laid at the Kremlin's door.&quot;  ‘Sorry guys, we've been lying to you for 50 years, but, now there's no Kremlin— so let's be straight.’ &quot;The threat to our interests is regional unrest,&quot; and ‘we've got to control it.’

===Current Events===

Incidentally, I notice  — the threat to our interests could not be laid at Iraq's door either. At that point, Saddam Hussein was a &quot;great friend and ally.&quot; He had— it's true— gassed Kurds, and tortured dissidents, and you know— massacred people, and so on. But he hadn't yet committed any crimes! (Laughs).  The crime was ‘disobedience’ that's a crime. That came a couple of months later. But at that point he was &quot;a great friend and ally,&quot; and the U.S. continued to support him right through these things that maybe you and I would call ‘crimes.’

It's interesting to hear, just to switch to another period. Like right now, when the US and its attack-dog attack-bomb Iraq— the line that you hear from Tony Blair and Madeline Albright— and other distinguished figures is that ‘we have to do this,’ ‘how could we let such a creature survive?’  He even committed the 'ultimate crime' of 'gassing his own population!’  Their willingness to say that— over and over— expresses extraordinary trust in the educated classes in England and the United States— who they trust not to say what everyone knows. That— that can't possibly be the reason— because we supported Saddam through those atrocities, and continued to increase the support after it. But their trust is warranted— as you can tell by looking at the press and commentary.

===Partnership Rights===

Going back— if you look at the structure of the system of control, you can determine very quickly how policy works.  Participants have rights that are commensurate with their role in the system.  So, the United States has rights by definition. The &quot;junior partner&quot; has rights as long as it stays loyal—same with the &quot;Arab façade,&quot; and the same with the local gendarmes.  What about the peasants in Iraq, or people in the slums in Cairo?  Well, ‘they don't contribute to the system,’ so ‘they have no rights.’

What about the Palestinians? Well, they actually have negative rights. The reason is, that they are a ‘disruptive element.’ The fact that they were displaced arouses nationalist feelings, and causes problems for the façade, and the gendarmes, and the attack-dog— and therefore their rights are negative.  These are just kind of elementary principles of statecraft— you master those, you can predict very easily the way policy develops. And it works quite well.

The end of the Cold War changed nothing, and that was well understood. One of the leading Israeli strategic analysts  — formerly head of military intelligence  — Schlomo Gazit, about a year after the end of the Cold War said: &quot;Israel's main task has not changed at all, and it remains of central importance. Israel remains of central importance as the devoted guardian of stability in the region, its role is to protect the existing regimes,&quot; (namely the façade,) &quot;and to prevent radicalization.&quot;  That's accurate,  — but you have to do a little translation.  So, &quot;stability&quot; means ‘U.S. control,’— and Israel is the &quot;devoted guardian&quot; of the control of the Master,  — and it's amply paid for its service.  &quot;Radicalism&quot; means ‘misunderstanding of who the first beneficiaries of a countries resources are.’ (Laughs)

And &quot;fundamentalist religious zealotry&quot; does not entail that we have to bomb Saudi Arabia, or bomb Jerusalem, or bomb most the United States  — which is the ‘extreme radical’, ‘fundamentalist-religious state’ in the world, I suppose... (Laughs).  Rather, what it means is… this is a codeword, which means ‘the particular forms of radicalization…’ —that is, &quot;failure to understand who the first beneficiaries are&quot; — the 'particular forms of radicalization that happen to take a religious cast when secular nationalism is destroyed.’ That’s a pretty common pattern. But if you make the translations— what Gazit was saying was certainly accurate.

===U.S.-Israeli Relations===
Well, U.S.-Israeli relations developed in that context. So in 1948, the US military was quite impressed by Israel's military actions. They were described, a couple of days ago in Israel's leading paper Ha'aretz, by a good reporter, as being &quot;Kosovo without TV cameras,&quot;— approximately accurate.  In 1949, US Army planners concluded, and I'm quoting: &quot;Israel had demonstrated by the force-of-arms its right to be considered the military power next to Turkey in the near and the Middle East.&quot;

In 1958, U.S. intelligence concluded that:  &quot;It is a logical corollary of opposition to radical Arab nationalism, to support Israel as the only reliable U.S. ally in the region.&quot; Actually, 1958 was a very important year in modern history.  The U.S. was facing three major crises at that time—they were described in now-declassified records, by Eisenhower and Dulles at the National Security Council. They said the US was facing three major crises— Indonesia, North Africa, and the Middle East. They also— Eisenhower and Dulles— both explain vociferously, according to the notes— that there was no Russian involvement in any of them.

Well these were all, of course, Islamic countries maybe like an early illustration of the ‘clash of civilizations.’ But that was irrelevant— I mean, they could have come from Mars.  The crucial thing about those three regions was that they were all oil producers.  The planning the concern over them was interrelated  having to do with the threat to U.S. domination of oil production in the Middle East, and maybe the use of Indonesia as a temporary substitute.  And there were very significant actions that took place  among them, the destruction of Indonesian democracy. The US carried out a huge clandestine operation to try to break up Indonesia, to try to separate off the outlying islands  the ones that were the oil producers.  That had all kinds of consequences.

In the Middle East, the U.S. landed troops in Lebanon.  Armed  apparently, with authorization to use nuclear weapons, according to high U.S. officials.  So, it was a serious matter.  The concern at that point was Iraq.  Iraq had broken the Anglo-American condominium over oil.  And remember  it's the second largest producer.  A military coup, which the US regarded as Nasserite in inspiration, had sort of pulled the country out of the system, and that caused real hysteria   I won't have time to go into it now, but talk about it if you like.  The British Foreign Secretary flew to the United States immediately, and they laid plans which are extremely revealing  they explain just about everything that was going on; and it's taken almost verbatim.  Anyhow, it was taken pretty seriously. That's 1958.

===Peace Process===

In the early 1960’s, there was a proxy war going on between Nasser and  — (Nasser was considered ‘the heart of the rot’— you know, the source of  &quot;radical nationalism.&quot;) There was a proxy war going on that between Nasser and Saudi Arabia, the main oil producer— which was very threatening. In 1967, Israel intervened and it smashed Nasser— and that was a major contribution. The US-Israeli alliance was solidified. After the Israeli military victory, Israel also became the darling of American intellectuals— going from far right to left liberal. Which is an interesting phenomenon about the United States, but its consequences show up mostly in the coverage of these events and the discussion about them.  In 1970, Israel again served proof that it’s a &quot;devoted guardian.&quot;  The US needed it to intervene to prevent possible Syrian involvement, to try to block Jordan  — which was then massacring Palestinians, and Israel did intervene and barred that.  And that was considered a very welcome contribution.  And US aid to Israel quadrupled at that point.  In 1979, when the Shah fell, Israel's role simply increased.  One of the main &quot;guardians&quot; was gone.  That’s actually the origins of what's falsely called the &quot;arms for hostages deal&quot;— which began at that time.  There were no &quot;hostages&quot;  — it's completely different.  But anyhow, it did solidify the alliance further.

Well, going back to '67 - that war was dangerous. It came well— quote  — Secretary McNamara, who was then Secretary of Defense: &quot;We damn near had war,&quot; he said, &quot;with the Russians.&quot;  There was an actual confrontation between the Russian and American navies in the eastern Mediterranean. And it was realized that ‘we better quiet things down.’ So, there was a diplomatic settlement worked out under the diplomatic initiative of the United States and its &quot;junior partner&quot;— that's the famous UN242.  UN242, on November 1967, basically called for &quot;full peace&quot; in return for &quot;full Israeli withdrawal.&quot;  Notice, that UN242 was completely rejectionist —that's very crucial for understanding what’s happening now.  It offered nothing to the Palestinians. It was an ‘agreement among states.’

So ‘full peace’ in return for ‘full withdrawal.’  It was deadlock.  The Arab states refused full peace, Israel refused full withdrawal.  That deadlock was broken in February 1971.  At that point, President Sadat of Egypt offered full peace to Israel for only partial withdrawal— namely withdrawal from Egyptian territory.  Well, the US kind of had an internal problem at that time— it was a bureaucratic battle that went on. It was won by Henry Kissinger,— who preferred force— what he called &quot;stalemate&quot;— &quot;no negotiations.&quot;  So he refused Sadat's offer, he took over— a very important date. That terminated U.S. support for UN242. Since that time, the US has not supported it— contrary to what you might read— because it has reinterpreted it to mean ‘partial withdrawal— as the United States and Israel determine.’

At that point— this was a period of enormous triumphalism— which Kissinger shared.  He thought Egypt was a kind of a basket case.  And his ignorance and stupidity— which are really colossal when you look at the documents— led directly to the 1973 war.  Which did demonstrate that Egypt wasn't a basket case— you had to pay some attention to it.  That even got through the clouds to Kissinger.  He then undertook shuttle diplomacy, and the plans at that point were: ‘Since you can't forget about Egypt, let's eliminate it.’  It was the major Arab military force—‘lets remove it from the conflict’ so that Israel can then proceed to integrate the territories and attack Lebanon.  That’s policy, which concluded, with Camp David.  That's what's known in the United States as the &quot;peace process.&quot;  And in fact that’s exactly what happened.  US support for Israel reached fifty percent of total aid at that point.

===Anti-Rejectionism===

Well, meanwhile, there was a shift in the international consensus going on.  It was shifting away from pure rejectionism— toward recognition of Palestinian rights.  That became a crisis on another crucial date, namely January 1976 when the Security Council debated a resolution, which included UN242, and all of its wording, but also called for a Palestinian state and the territories Israel was to leave, under UN242.  Well, that was supported by the whole world, virtually.  The Arab states, the PLO, the Russians, Europe, Latin America— everybody.  Except the one state that counts— which vetoed it.  So the U.S. vetoed that resolution.  And it's also vetoed from history— you might try to search for it.  But it was a very crucial date.  At that point, the U.S. became doubly rejectionist— in a strong sense. No UN242, and no Palestinian rights— alone in the world, virtually.  Except for Israel.

Well then, matters continued.  Things shifted over to the General Assembly. There were almost annual votes of a similar nature— usually like 150 to 2 or something like that.  There were initiatives from Europe, from Arab states, the PLO— all rejected by the United States. The leading journals - like say, the New York Times - refused even to publish most of them— even letters referring to them.  All of this is what called the &quot;peace process,&quot; again.  That continued, until 1990.  The last General Assembly vote was December, 1990— 144 to 2. Then came the Gulf War.

The Gulf War established, as George Bush put it— ‘The Gulf War established that’ &quot;what we say goes.&quot;  And you better understand it.  It was understood. So, &quot;what we say goes.&quot;  The US returned to its support for its old friend Saddam while he murdered Shiites and Kurds.  Since then, he has been returning to a rather rational policy of destroying Iraqi society.  That's highly rational— especially for an oil producing state. If you destroy the society and the population, there's much less concern that the ‘first beneficiaries’ might be the people of the region— because they’re not going to be able to ask for anything. So, the policy that's going on now— of basically mass murder— is a very reasonable policy, particularly for an oil producer.

With regard to the Israel-Arab problem, the Israel-Palestinian problem, the US immediately moved onto Madrid.  Fall 1991.  The Madrid conference met all US conditions.  First, it was unilateral  — no interference from the Europeans or anyone else.  Secondly, it was totally rejectionist.  So the U.S. could ram-through its rejectionist program.  That was the official program.  It actually has yet to be reported in the United States, as far as I’m aware  — in the mainstream that is. But it was the Baker Plan.  The Baker Plan, which simply endorsed the Shamir-Peres plan, which stated &quot;there cannot be an additional Palestinian state.&quot;  &quot;Additional,&quot; because there already is one— namely Jordan.  So, there can be &quot;no additional Palestinian state.&quot;  And the fate of the territories has to be settled according to the guidelines of the State of Israel.  That was the official US program, endorsing the Shamir-Paris consensus, which was instituted at Madrid.

We then move onto Oslo, September 1993.  The Declaration of Principles was signed.  And it was an enormous victory for the United States.  I don't know if you've looked at it, but you should look at what it said.  It didn't say much  — but it said something.  It described the permanent settlement that is the long-term end goal, which must be achieved.  And that must be strictly UN242, not the other UN resolutions, which called for Palestinian rights alongside of Israel.  And of course 'UN242' means, the US interpretation of it, which rejects 242. So the permanent settlement is doubly rejectionist.  No Palestinian rights, no UN242.  Israeli withdrawal — just as the US and Israel decide.

The US and Israel had decided.  They were pursuing a program was called the Al-Hon program, that the Israeli Labor government instituted in 1968, which essentially - it's varied a little bit over the years... But the basic idea is, Israel keeps roughly 40 percent of the occupied territories.  The resources primarily water, the useable land, the nice suburbs of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, which are mostly in the West Bank. And part of the Gaza Strip they want, and so on.  And the rest, sort of leave to the &quot;recalcitrant Arabs,&quot; — the &quot;uncivilized tribesmen.&quot; 

That's changed a little bit over the years - right now it's a little different.  Netanyahu calls for what he calls 'the Alon Plus' - so the Alon Plan, plus a little bit more.  His opponent, of the Labor Party—Barak—he calls for the ‘Expanded Alon’ plan.  So those are the two groupings in Israel — either ‘Alon Plus’ or the ‘Expanded Alon’ plan.  One political commentator, in Ha'aretz again, says that: &quot;One listens to the ideas of Barak, and hears the voice of Netanyahu,&quot; paraphrasing a Biblical passage.  And the US supports it of course.

After Oslo, Rabin and Perez immediately moved to expand settlement and development - took over about 30 percent of Gaza Strip - most of its meager resources.  In the West Bank, the most crucial part of its development is what's called &quot;Greater Jerusalem.&quot;  &quot;Greater Jerusalem&quot; is a huge area extending from Ramallah to Bethlehem and as far east as Jericho.  And since Israel is keeping the Jordan Valley, it essentially breaks up the West Bank into two cantons. There are other developments, which break it up into further ones.

Olso II, September 1995, spells all of this out further. There's the Palestinian Authority, which can sort of run affairs in downtown Nablus.  And then, there's roughly a hundred, actually more than a hundred, scattered Palestinian settlements - separated from one another - and crucially isolated from the economic, cultural, and even the medical centers of Jerusalem —Centers of Palestinian life.  The Jewish areas are connected by superhighways - you can drive through and not even notice there are any Palestinians.  Then there are things, which are officially called 'Palestinian roads'.  Actually I drove one, not long ago, from Bethlehem to Ramallah.  I mean, if you make it alive, you're lucky —if it's raining, very lucky. Those are the Palestinian roads, which interconnect the Palestinian settlements.

Well, somebody’s got to manage the Palestinian population. That's where Yasser Arafat and the PLO come in  — that's a gangster regime, based on robbery and brutality. The managers of it are there to enrich themselves and suppress the locals. The more brutally they do it, the more they are applauded by Al Gore and Bill Clinton. That's the essential content of the Wye Accords. The CIA is down there to supervise to make sure everything goes just right.  This should not surprise anyone. This is absolutely a typical colonial pattern.  That's the way the British ran the Raj, that's the way the U.S. runs Central America  — it's just standard. Now it's being carried over to this case.

===Style===

Well, the goals have been perfectly obvious for years and years, to anybody with eyes open. It takes real dedication to miss them. And remember, these are the plans that Labor does, even if the voice is Netanyahu's. I was in Israel not too long ago, giving talks about this, and I started by just reading a paragraph from a standard history of South Africa, in the early 1960s  — at the time when they were setting up the first homelands  — Transkei.  It's kind of late, so I'll skip the paragraph, unless you want me to read it.  But the point is, I didn't have to comment, you read the paragraph about the establishment of Transkei and everybody could recognize what’s happening right outside the door. That's exactly it — that's the position of the doves.

Now, there are differences between Rabin and Perez  — the two ‘heroes’  — Netanyahu ‘the villain.’  There are a number of differences, contrary to the comment in the Israeli press.  Rabin and Perez were adamantly opposed to calling what the Palestinians got &quot;a state.&quot;  On the other hand, Netanyahu's been more ambiguous.  So his minister of  — director of communications and policy planning, David Bari-Lan, recently said that well, &quot;If the Palestinians want to call these scattered areas 'a state' we won't mind. In fact  if they want, they can call it ‘fried chicken’&quot; he said  elegantly. (laughs) There's a little difference between the two.

There's also a difference in style, and the style is important. And the style reflects their constituencies. Labor is the party of the rich - the party of the professionals, the westernized, secular elements.  Likud - the other party - is the party of the poor, working people, Oriental Jews  — religious and so on.  Labor is much more attuned to the norms of western hypocrisy.  So they have spokesmen like Abba-Ebban who knows how to put in nice phrases - things like, &quot;beating them up&quot; and so on. Likud tends to be much more brazen - and offensive to the West. 'Cause we don't like it - it hurts our humanistic instincts to have to face what were doing.

Shimon Perez, as housing minister, pointed out correctly, he says that, &quot;Labor builds quietly.&quot;  That's what he said as he was announcing the plans for construction in what Israel calls Ha'ar-Homa.  Which was later implemented by Netanyahu and blamed on him cause it broke up the peace negotiations.  So it was initiated by Labor, except that they &quot;build quietly.&quot; So therefore, in the West, you can pretend that they're not doing it.  That is a difference, and that's why the US much prefers labor— always has.  It doesn't like Likud.

And it reflects itself in US coverage.  So if you go to the sort of dovish pro-Palestinian extreme of mainstream coverage— say Anthony Lewis in the New York Times— here’s a typical article denouncing the ‘bad Netanyahu,’ and contrasting him with the ‘saintly Rabin,’ which, quoting now— &quot;with sheer intellectual honesty, was willing to sign the Oslo agreement, while Netanyahu opposes any solution that would give the Palestinians a viable state. Tiny, disarmed, poor, dominated by Israel, but their own.&quot; And he says: &quot;that's the heart of the matter&quot;—‘that's the crucial difference between the ‘saintly Rabin’ and the ‘bad Netanyahu.’

Actually, his facts are wrong.  Netanyahu is more forthcoming about a Palestinian state.  And the current difference is between the Alon Plus and the Expanded Alon plan— that is, two forms of the South Africans’ Homelands policy at the worst moments— the deepest moments— of South African apartheid.  So, what we can say then— looking at our own society— is that at the extreme left wing, dovish, pro-Palestinian end, they are rising to level of the depths of South-African apartheid. That is, maybe, because this is a sympathetic interpretation.

Just recently, Hillary Clinton as you know, expressed an interest in running for the Senate in New York. The New York Times ran a headline called &quot;New York’s Palestinian state&quot; and it condemned what they called a &quot;monumental political gaffe&quot; of Hillary Clinton who had said a couple of years ago that: &quot;The territory that the Palestinians currently inhabit&quot;, what she meant is &quot;the territories they're allowed to administer,&quot; and &quot;whatever they might get in peace negotiations,&quot; &quot;should evolve into a functioning modern state.&quot;  That is, a state that’s ‘tiny, disarmed, poor, dominated by Israel, but their own.’ And that was a &quot;terrible political gaffe,&quot; —the White House quickly disowned those dangerous thoughts, and she was denounced all over the place.

But she also got some support. So, the Times quoted a political science professor, who supported her and said: &quot;Supporting a Palestinian state used to be a peacenik position — the extreme left-wing position. But now, maybe no more.&quot;  Like now, ‘maybe’ we can move forward, up to the stand of the worst South African racists thirty-five years ago, and we can no longer condemn that as the &quot;peacenik extreme left-wing position.&quot;  So, our ‘moral and intellectual culture’ &quot;may&quot; be making real progress, and ‘sooner or later,’ may reach the depths of South Africa— though we can't be sure... (Laughs) These are all comments about us, not about the situation there.

===Prospects===

Is there a way out of all of this?  Well when you grow up, you're supposed to become more mature —maybe I'm missing a gene or something. (Laughs) I still believe what I thought when I was teenage Zionist youth activist, more than... almost 60 years ago.  At that time, as a Zionist youth activist, I was strongly opposed to a Jewish state.  Which was called a Zionist position at the time— now it’s an anti-Zionist position.  It's the same position —the meaning of the word has changed.

And the reasons were pretty straightforward:  A ‘democratic Jewish state’ is an absolute contradiction in terms. You can try to pretend &quot;circles are squares&quot; if you like —but it’s more work.  It’s a contradiction in terms.  Furthermore a Jewish state, it was clear, was going to exacerbate conflicts and tensions.  And thirdly, it was going to destroy the attractive elements in the existing societies —which were quite real. They’re not going to survive a state, and ethnic conflict.

And there was an alternative.  The alternative, which was then-Zionist position, was some kind of bi-nationalist federation, recognizing there were two national groups involved, moving towards closer integration as circumstances permit, on the basis of cooperation between people across national lines —which are not the only national lines in the world.  So, on the basis of common class interests, or cultural interests, or other interests.

Well, 1948 that became academic.  In 1967 it became realistic. At that point, Israel controlled the whole region.  It could have instituted a regime of that sort, with no opposition.  In fact it would have been welcome.  I actually suggested it a lot at that time.  That led to extreme denunciations, particularly from Israeli doves.  Including, I'm sorry to say, old friends.  And the reason was, it was a period of enormous triumphalism, in Israel and the United States.  Nobody wanted to hear anything.  So that was gone. But, after 1973 that opportunity was lost.  There was a window of opportunity from ‘67 up to the ‘73 war. It was lost.  Now, it's conceivable that it’s realistic again.

It should be obvious to any sane person that there is no two-state settlement other than the South African Transkei settlement.  And it’s kind of interesting that —I don't know exactly what it means —that this traditional Zionist idea that I just described —you know —on the fringe (I don't want to say it’s the mainstream), is being revived a little bit in Israel, with some significance, when they debate.  The important point for us is that the US —the attitude that the United States takes, is decisive —as always.  Whatever happens here is decisive.  It doesn’t determine everything, but it overwhelmingly determines what happens there.  It’s the one factor that’s under our control, and that may perhaps offer a gleam of light in the general darkness, if we choose to do something about it.

(Applause)

 | notes    = The '''United States Declaration of Independence''' is a statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, announcing that the Thirteen Colonies then at war with Great Britain were no longer a part of the British Empire. Written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, the Declaration is a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The birthday of the United States of America—Independence Day—is celebrated on July 4, the day the wording of the Declaration was adopted by the Congress.

Congress issued the Declaration in several forms. The first published version was a typeset broadside printed by John Dunlap, which only listed the names of John Hancock and Charles Thomson as signers. In 1777, Congress issued the Goddard Broadside, which listed all of the signers. What became the most famous version of the Declaration was a handwritten copy signed by the delegates, known as the engrossed version, which is on display in the National Archives in Washington, D.C.''

The Dunlap Broadside, the Goddard Broadside, and Engrossed Declaration vary slightly. What follows is the Declaration as it appears in the Dunlap Broadside.

See also the [[Draft of the Declaration of Independence]] and [[United States Declaration of Independence (as it was written)]].

The Declaration of Independence is the first of the three Charters of Freedom along with the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

{{small-caps|In {{UC|Congress}}, July 4, 1776.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;A {{UC|Declaration}}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By the {{UC|Representatives}} of the&lt;br /&gt;
{{UC|United states of America}},&lt;br /&gt;
In {{UC|general Congress}} assembled}}.
&lt;/center&gt;

{{UC|{{dropinitial|W}}hen}} in the course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation.

{{small-caps|We}} hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness—-That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The History of the Present King of Great-Britain is a History of repeated Injuries and Usurpations, all having in direct Object the Establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid World.

{{small-caps|He}} has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public Good.

{{small-caps|He}} has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing Importance, unless suspended in their Operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

{{small-caps|He}} has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation of large Districts of People; unless those People would relinquish the Right of Representation in the Legislature, a Right inestimable to them, and formidable to Tyrants only.

{{small-caps|He}} has called together Legislative Bodies at Places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the Depository of their public Records, for the sole Purpose of fatiguing them into Compliance with his Measures.

{{small-caps|He}} has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly Firmness his Invasions on the Rights of the People.

{{small-caps|He}} has refused for a long Time, after such Dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the Dangers of Invasion from without, and Convulsions within.

{{small-caps|He}} has endeavoured to prevent the Population of these States; for that Purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations hither, and raising the Conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

{{small-caps|He}} has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

{{small-caps|He}} has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and Amount and Payment of their Salaries.

{{small-caps|He}} has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their Substance.

{{small-caps|He}} has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our Legislature.

{{small-caps|He}} has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.

{{small-caps|He}} has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

{{small-caps|For}} quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us:

{{small-caps|For}} protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

{{small-caps|For}} cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World:

{{small-caps|For}} imposing taxes on us without our Consent:

{{small-caps|For}} depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury:

{{small-caps|For}} transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offences:

{{small-caps|For}} abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries, so as to render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for introducing the same absolute Rule in these Colonies:

{{small-caps|For}} taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

{{small-caps|For}} suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with Powers to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever.

{{small-caps|He}} has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

{{small-caps|He}} has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our Towns, and destroyed the Lives of our People.

{{small-caps|He}} is, at this Time, transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the Works of Death, Desolation, and Tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized Nation.

{{small-caps|He}} has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the Executioners of their Friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

{{small-caps|He}} has excited domestic Insurrections among us, and has endeavoured to bring on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.

{{small-caps|In}} every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury. A Prince, whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People.

{{small-caps|Nor}} have we been wanting in Attentions to our British Brethren. We have warned them from Time to Time of Attempts by their Legislature to extend an unwarrantable Jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the Circumstances of our Emigration and Settlement here. We have appealed to their native Justice and Magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the Ties of our common Kindred to disavow these Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our Connections and Correspondence. They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice and of Consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the Necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of Mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends.

{{small-caps|We}}, therefore, the Representatives of the {{UC|United States of America}}, in {{small-caps|General Congress}}, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly Publish and Declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be, {{small-caps|Free and Independent States}}; that they are absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political Connection between them and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as {{small-caps|Free and Independent States}}, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which {{small-caps|Independent States}} may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of the divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

&lt;center&gt;

'''Joint Statement by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, August 14, 1941 :'''

The following statement signed by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain is released for the information of the Press: 

The President of the United States and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, have met at sea. 

They have been accompanied by officials of their two Governments, including high ranking officers of the Military, Naval and Air Services 

The whole problem of the supply of munitions of war, as provided by the Lease-Lend Act, for the armed forces of the United States and for those countries actively engaged in resisting aggression has been further examined. 

Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Supply of the British Government, has joined in these conferences. He is going to proceed to Washington to discuss further details with appropriate officials of the United States Government. These conferences will also cover the supply problems of the Soviet Union. 

The President and the Prime Minister have had several conferences They have considered the dangers to world civilization arising from the policies of military domination by conquest upon which the Hitlerite government of Germany and other governments associated therewith have embarked, and have made clear the stress which their countries are respectively taking for their safety in the face of these dangers. 

They have agreed upon the following joint declaration:

Joint declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world. 

'''First''', their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other; 

'''Second''', they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; 

''' Third''', they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them; 

''' Fourth''', they will endeavor, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity; 

''' Fifth''', they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the objector securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and social security; 

''' Sixth''', after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want; 

''' Seventh''', such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance; 

''' Eighth''', they believe that all of the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments

Note:  Although the press release says that this statement was signed by Roosevelt and Churchill, neither one of them ever signed it.  It was a press release and not actually a legal document.  The Web images of an official-looking document entitled &quot;Atlantic Charter&quot; and bearing a date of August 14, 1941 are of a mass-produced poster printed in 1943 that was the product of propagandists at the Office of War Information.  It is, in fact, &quot;OWI Poster No. 50&quot;.

''The General Assembly''

''Proclaims'' this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.

===Part I : Optimism Within===
Could we choose our environment, and were desire in human undertakings synonymous with endowment, all men would, I suppose, be optimists. Certainly most of us regard happiness as the proper end of all earthly enterprise. The will to be happy animates alike the philosopher, the prince and the chimney-sweep. No matter how dull, or how mean, or how wise a man is, he feels that happiness is his indisputable right.

It is curious to observe what different ideals of happiness people cherish, and in what singular places they look for this well-spring of their life. Many look for it in the hoarding of riches, some in the pride of power, and others in the achievements if art and literature; a few seek it in the exploration of their own minds, or in search for knowledge.

Most people measure their happiness in terms of physical pleasure and material possession. Could they win some visible goal which they have set on the horizon, how happy they could be! Lacking this gift or that circumstance, they would be miserable. If happiness is to be so measured, I who cannot hear or see have every reason to sit in a corner with folded hands and weep. If I am happy in spite of my deprivations, if my happiness is so deep that it is a faith, so thoughtful that it becomes a philosophy of life, —if, in short, I am an optimist, my testimony to the creed of optimism is worth hearing. As sinners stand up in meeting and testify to the goodness of God, so one who is called afflicted may rise up in gladness of conviction and testify to the goodness of life.

Once I knew the depth where no hope was, and darkness lay on the face of all things. Then love came and set my soul free. Once I knew only darkness and stillness. Now I know hope and joy. Once I fretted and beat myself against the wall that shut me in. Now I rejoice in the consciousness that I can think, act and attain heaven. My life was without past or future; death, the pessimist would say, &quot;a consummation devoutly to be wished.&quot; But a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living. Night fled before the day of thought, and love and joy and hope came up in a passion of obedience to knowledge. Can anyone who escaped such captivity, who has felt the thrill and glory of freedom, be a pessimist?

My early experience was thus a leap from bad to good. If I tried, I could not check the momentum of my first leap out of the dark; to move breast forward as a habit learned suddenly at that first moment of release and rush into the light. With the first word I used intelligently, I learned to live, to think, to hope. Darkness cannot shut me in again. I have had a glimpse of the shore, and can now live by the hope of reaching it.

So my optimism is no mild and unreasoning satisfaction. A poet once said I must be happy because I did not see the bare, cold present, but lived in a beautiful dream. I do live in a beautiful dream; but that dream is the actual, the present, —not cold, but warm; not bare, but furnished with a thousand blessings. The very evil which the poet supposed would be a cruel disillusionment is necessary to the fullest knowledge of joy. Only by contact with evil could I have learned to feel by contrast the beauty of truth and love and goodness.

It is a mistake always to contemplate the good and ignore the evil, because by making people neglectful it lets in disaster. There is a dangerous optimism of ignorance and indifference. It is not enough to say that the twentieth century is the best age in the history of mankind, and to take refuge from the evils of the world in skyey dreams of good. How many good men, prosperous and contented, looked around and saw naught but good, while millions of their fellow-men were bartered and sold like cattle! No doubt, there were comfortable optimists who thought Wilberforce a meddlesome fanatic when he was working with might and main to free the slaves. I distrust the rash optimism in this country that cries, &quot;Hurrah, we're all right! This is the greatest nation on earth,&quot; when there are grievances that call loudly for redress. That is false optimism. Optimism that does not count the cost is like a house builded on sand. A man must understand evil and be acquainted with sorrow before he can write himself an optimist and expect others to believe that he has reason for the faith that is in him.

I know what evil is. Once or twice I have wrestled with it, and for a time felt its chilling touch on my life; so I speak with knowledge when I say that evil is of no consequence, except as a sort of mental gymnastic. For the very reason that I have come in contact with it, I am more truly an optimist. I can say with conviction that the struggle which evil necessitates is one of the greatest blessings. It makes us strong, patient, helpful men and women. It lets us into the soul of things and teaches us that although the world is full of suffering, it is full also of the overcoming of it. My optimism, then, does not rest on the absence of evil, but on a glad belief in the preponderance of good and a willing effort always to cooperate with the good, that it may prevail. I try to increase the power God has given me to see the best in everything and every one, and make that Best a part of my life. The world is sown with good; but unless I turn my glad thoughts into practical living and till my own field, I cannot reap a kernel of the good.

Thus my optimism is grounded in two worlds, myself and what is about me. I demand that the world be good, and lo, it obeys. I proclaim the world good, and facts range themselves to prove my proclamation overwhelmingly true. To what good I open the doors of my being, and jealously shut them against what is bad. Such is the force of this beautiful and willful conviction, it carries itself in the face of all opposition. I am never discouraged by absence of good. I never can be argued into hopelessness. Doubt and mistrust are the mere panic of timid imagination, which the steadfast heart will conquer, and the large mind transcend.

As my college days draw to a close, I find myself looking forward with beating heart and bright anticipations to what the future holds of activity for me. My share in the work of the world may be limited; but the fact that it is work makes it precious. Nay, the desire and will to work is optimism itself.

Two generations ago Carlyle flung forth his gospel of work. To the dreamers of the Revolution, who built cloud-castles of happiness, and, when the inevitable winds rent the castles asunder, turned pessimists —to those ineffectual Endymions, Alastors and Werthers, this Scots peasant, man of dreams in the hard, practical world, cried aloud his creed of labor. &quot;Be no longer a Chaos, but a World. Produce! produce! Were it but the pitifullest infinitesimal fraction of product, produce it, in God's name! 'Tis the utmost thou hast in thee; out with it, then. Up, up! whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy whole might. Work while it is called To-day; for the Night cometh wherein no man may work.&quot;

Some have said Carlyle was taking refuge from a hard world by bidding men grind and toil, eyes to the earth, and so forget their misery. This is not Carlyle's thought. &quot;Fool!&quot; he cries, &quot;the Ideal is in thyself; the Impediment is also in thyself. Work out the Ideal in the poor, miserable Actual; live, think, believe, and be free!&quot; It is plain what he says, that work, production, brings life out of chaos, makes the individual a world, an order; and order is optimism.

I, too, can work, and because I love to labor with my head and my hands, I am an optimist in spite of all. I used to think I should be thwarted in my desire to do something useful. But I have found out that through the ways in which I can make myself useful are few, yet the work open to me is endless. The gladdest laborer in the vineyard may be a cripple. Even should the others outstrip him, yet the vineyard ripens in the sun each year, and the full clusters weigh into his hand. Darwin could work only half an hour at a time; yet in many diligent half-hours he laid anew the foundations of philosophy. I long to accomplish a great and noble task; but it is my chief duty and joy to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble. It is my service to think how I can best fulfill the demands that each day makes upon me, and to rejoice that others can do what I cannot. Green, the historian, tells us that the world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker; and that thought alone suffices to guide me in this dark world and wide. I love the good that others do; for their activity is an assurance that whether I can help that whether I can help or not, the true and the good will stand sure.

I trust, and nothing that happens disturbs my trust. I recognize the beneficence of the power which we all worship as supreme— Order, Fate, the Great Spirit, Nature, God. I recognize this power in the sun that makes all things grow and keeps life afoot. I make a friend of this indefinable force, and straightway I feel glad, brave and ready for any lot Heaven may decree for me. This is my religion of optimism.

===Part II : Optimism Without===
Optimism, then, is a fact within my own heart. But as I look out upon life, my heart meets no contradiction. The outward world justifies my inward universe of good. All through the years I have spent in college, my reading has been a continuous discovery of good. In literature, philosophy, religion and history I find the mighty witnesses to my faith.

Philosophy is the history of a deaf-blind person writ large. From the talks of Socrates up through Plato, Berkeley and Kant, philosophy records the efforts of human intelligence to be free of the clogging material world and fly forth into a universe of pure idea. A deaf-blind person ought to find special meaning in Plato's Ideal World. These things which you see and hear and touch are not the reality of realities, but imperfect manifestations of the Idea, the Principal, the Spiritual; the Idea is the truth, the rest is delusion.

If this be so, my brethren who enjoy the fullest use of the senses are not aware of any reality which may not equally well be in reach of my mind. Philosophy gives to the mind the prerogative of seeing truth, and bears us not a realm where I, who am blind, and not different from you who see. When I learned from Berkeley that your eyes receive an inverted image of things which your brain unconsciously corrects, I began to suspect that the eye is not a very reliable instrument after all, and I felt as one who had been restored to equality with others, glad, not because the senses avail them so little, but because in God's eternal world, mind and spirit avail so much. It seemed to me that philosophy had been written for my special consolation, whereby I get even with some modern philosophers who apparently think that I was intended as an experimental case for their special instruction! But in a little measure my small voice of individual experience does join in the declaration of philosophy that the good is the only world, and that world is a world of spirit. It is also a universe where order is All, where an unbroken logic holds the parts together, where distance defines itself as non-existence, where evil, as St. Augustine held, is delusion, and therefore is not. 

The meaning of philosophy to me is not only its principles, but also in the happy isolation of its great expounders. They were seldom of the world, even when like Plato and Leibnitz they moved in its courts and drawing rooms. To the tumult of life they were deaf, and they were blind to its distraction and perplexing diversities. Sitting alone, but not in darkness, they learned to find everything in themselves, and failing to find it even there, they still trusted in meeting the truth face to face when they should leave the earth behind and become partakers in the wisdom of God. The great mystics lived alone, deaf and blind, but dwelling with God.

I understand how it was possible for Spinoza to find deep and sustained happiness when he was excommunicated, poor, despised and suspected alike by Jew and Christian; not that the kind world of men ever treated me so, but that his isolation from the universe of sensuous joys is somewhat analogous to mine. He loved the good for its own sake. Like many great spirits he accepted his place in the world, and confided himself childlike to a higher power, believing that it worked through his hands and predominated in his being. He trusted implicitly, and that is what I do. Deep, solemn optimism, it seems to me, should spring from this firm belief in the presence of God in the individual; not a remote, unapproachable governor of the universe, but a God who is very near every one of us, who is present not only in earth, sea and sky, but also in every pure and noble impulse of our hearts, &quot;the source and centre of all minds, their only point of rest.&quot;

Thus from the philosophy I learn that we see only shadows and know only in part, and that all things change; but the mind, the unconquerable mind, compasses all truth, embraces the universe as it is, converts the shadows to realities and makes tumultuous changes seem but moments in an eternal silence, or short lines in the infinite theme of perfection, and the evil but &quot;a halt on the way to good.&quot; Though with my hand I grasp only a small part of the universe, with my spirit I see the whole, and in my thought I can compass the beneficent laws by which it is governed. The confidence and trust which these conceptions inspire teach me to rest safe in my life as in a fate, and protect me from spectral doubts and fears. Verily, blessed are ye that have not seen, and yet have believed.

All the world's great philosophers have been lovers of God and believers in man's inner goodness. To know the history of philosophy is to know that the highest thinkers of the ages, the seers of the tribes and the nations, have been optimists.

The growth of philosophy is the story of man's spiritual life. Outside lies that great mass of events which we call History. As I look on this mass I see it take form and shape itself in the ways of God. The history of man is an epic of progress. In the world within and the world without I see a wonderful correspondence, a glorious symbolism which reveals the human divine communing together, the lesson of philosophy repeated in fact. In all the parts that compose, the history of mankind hides the spirit of good, and gives meaning to the whole.

Far back in the twilight of history I see the savage fleeing from the forces of nature which he has not learned control, and seeking to propitiate supernatural beings which are but the creation of his superstitious fear. With a shift of his imagination I see the savage emancipated, civilized. He no longer worships the grim deities of ignorance. Through suffering he has learned to build a roof over his head, to defend his life and his home, and over his state he has erected a temple in which he worships the joyous gods of light and song. From suffering he has learned justice; from the struggle with his fellows he has learned the distinction between right and wrong which makes him a moral being. He is sighted with the genius of Greece.

But Greece was not perfect. He poetical and religious ideals were far above her practice; therefore she died, that her ideals might survive to ennoble coming ages.

Rome, too, left the world a rich inheritance. Through the vicissitudes of history her laws and ordered government have stood a majestic object-lesson for the ages. But when the stern, frugal character of her people ceased to be the bone and sinew of her civilization, Rome fell.

Then came the new nations of the North and founded a more permanent society. The base of Greek and Roman society was the slave, crushed into the condition of the wretches who &quot;labored, foredone in the field and at the workshop, like haltered horses, if blind, so much the quieter.&quot; The base of the new society was the freeman who fought, tilled, judged and grew from more to more. He wrought a state out of tribal kinship and fostered an independence and self-reliance which no oppression could destroy. The story of man's slow ascent from savagery through barbarism and self-mastery to civilization is the embodiment of the spirit of optimism. From the first hour of the new nations each century has seen a better Europe, until the development of the world demanded America.

Tolstoi said the other day that America, once the hope of the world, was in bondage to Mammon. Tolstoi and other Europeans have still much to learn about this great, free country of ours before they understand the unique civic struggle which America is undergoing. She is confronted with the mighty task of assimilating all the foreigners that are drawn together from every country, and welding them into one people with one national spirit. We have the right to demand the forbearance of critics until the United States has demonstrated whether she can make one people out of all nations of the earth. London economists are alarmed at less than five hundred thousand foreign-born in a population of six million, and discuss earnestly the danger of too many aliens. But what is their problem in comparison with that of New York, which counts nearly one million five hundred thousand foreigners among its three and a half million citizens? Think of it! Every third person in our American metropolis is an alien. By these figures alone America's greatness can be measured. 

It is true, America has devoted herself largely to the solution of material problems—breaking the fields, opening mines, irrigating the deserts, spanning the continent with railroads; but she is doing these things in a new way, by educating her people, by placing at the service of every man's need every resource of human skill. She is transmuting her industrial wealth into the education of her workmen, so that unskilled people shall have no place in American life, so that all men shall bring mind and soul to the control of matter. Her children are not drudges and slaves. The Constitution has declared it, and the spirit of our institutions has confirmed it. The best the land can teach them they shall know. They shall learn that there is no upper class in their country, and no lower, and they shall understand how it is that God and His world are for everybody.

America might do all this, and still be selfish, still be a worshipper of Mammon. But America is the home of charity as well as commerce. In the midst of roaring traffic, side by side with noisy factory and sky-reaching warehouse, one sees the school, the library, the hospital, the park-works of public benevolence which represent wealth wrought into ideas that shall endure forever. Behold what America has already done to alleviate suffering and restore the afflicted to society —given sight to the fingers of the blind, language to the dumb lip, and mind to the idiot clay, and tell me if indeed she worships Mammon only. Who shall measure the sympathy, skill and intelligence with which she ministers to all who come to her, and lessens the ever-swelling tide of poverty, misery and degradation which every year rolls against her gates from all the nations? When I reflect on all these facts, I cannot but think that, Tolstoi and other theorists to the contrary, it is a splendid thing to be an American. In America the optimist finds abundant reason for confidence in the present and hope for the future, and this hope, this confidence, may well extend over all the great nations of the earth.

If we compare our own time with the past, we find in modern statistics a solid foundation for a confident and buoyant world-optimism. Beneath the doubt, the unrest, the materialism, which surround us still glows and burns at the world's best life a steadfast faith. To hear the pessimist, one would think civilization Had bivouacked in the Middle Ages, and had not had marching orders since. He does not realize that the progress of evolution is not an uninterrupted march.

: &lt;i&gt; &quot;Now touching goal, now backward hurl'd,
: Toils the indomitable world.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

I have recently read an address by one whose knowledge it would be presumptuous to challenge. In it I find abundant evidence of progress.

During the past fifty years crime has decreased. True, the records of to-day contain a longer list of crime. But our statistics are more complete and accurate than the statistics of times past. Besides, there are many offenses on the list which half a century ago would not have been thought of as crimes. This shows that the public conscience is more sensitive than it ever was.

Our definition of crime has grown stricter, our punishment of it more lenient and intelligent. The old feeling of revenge has largely disappeared. It is no longer an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The criminal is treated as one who is diseased. He is confined not merely for punishment, but because he is a menace to society. While he is under restraint, he is treated with human care and disciplined so that his mind shall be cured of its disease, and he shall be restored to society able to so his part of its work.

Another sign of awakened and enlightened public conscience is the effort to provide the working-class with better houses. Did it occur to anyone a hundred years ago to think whether the dwellings of the poor were sanitary, convenient or sunny? Do not forget that in the &quot;good old times&quot; cholera and typhus devastated whole counties, and that pestilence walked abroad in the capitals of Europe.

Not only have our laboring-classes better houses and better places to work in; but employers recognize the right of the employed to seek more than the bare wage of existence. In the darkness and turmoil of our modern industrial strifes we discern but dimly the principles that underlie the struggle. The recognition of the right of all men to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, a spirit of conciliation such as Burke dreamed of, the willingness on the part of the strong to make concessions to the weak, the realization that the rights of the employer are bound up in the rights of the employed —in these the optimist beholds the signs of our times.

Another right which State has recognized as belonging to each man is the right to an education. In the enlightened parts of Europe and in America every city, every town, every village, has its school; and it is no longer a class who have access to knowledge, for to the children of the poorest laborer the school-door stands open. From the civilized nations universal education is driving the dull host of illiteracy.

Education broadens to include all men, and deepens to teach all truths. Scholars are no longer confined to Greek, Latin and mathematics, but they also study science converts the dreams of the poet, the theory of the mathematician and the fiction of the economist into ships, hospitals and instruments that enable one skilled hand to perform the work of a thousand. The student of to-day is not asked if he has learned his grammar. Is he a mere grammar machine, a dry catalogue of scientific facts, or has he acquired the qualities of manliness? His supreme lesson is to grapple with great public questions, to keep his mind hospitable to new idea and new views of truth, to restore the finer ideals that are lost sight of in the struggle for wealth and to promote justice between man and man. He learns that there may be substitutes for human labor —horse-power and machinery and books; but &quot;there are no substitutes for common sense, patience, integrity, courage.&quot;

Who can doubt the vastness of the achievements of education when one considers how different the conditions of the blind and the deaf is from what it was a century ago? They were then objects of superstitious pity, and shared the lowest beggar's lot. Everybody looked upon their case as hopeless, and this view plunged them deeper in despair. The blind themselves laughed in the face of Hauy when he offered to teach them to read. How pitiable is the cramped sense of imprisonment in circumstances which teaches men to expect no good and to treat any attempt to relieve them as the vagary of a disordered mind! But now, behold the transformation; see how institutions and industrial establishments for the blind have sprung up as if by magic; see how many of the deaf have learned not only to read and write, but to speak; and remember that the faith and patience of Dr. Howe have borne fruit in the efforts that are being made everywhere to educate the deaf-blind and equip them for the struggle. Do you wonder that I am full of hope and lifted up?

The highest result of education is tolerance. Long ago men fought and died for their faith; but it took ages to teach them the other kind of courage, —the courage to recognize the faiths of their brethren and their rights of conscience. Tolerance is the first principal of community; it is the spirit which conserves the best that all men think. No loss by flood and lightening, no destruction of cities and temples by the hostile forces of nature, has deprived man of so many noble lives and impulses as those which his tolerance has destroyed.

With wonder and sorrow I go back in thought to the ages of intolerance and bigotry. I see Jesus received with scorn and nailed on the cross. I see his followers hounded and tortured and burned. I am present where the finer spirits that revolt from the superstition of the Middle Ages are accused of impiety and stricken down. I behold the children of Israel reviled and persecuted unto death by those who pretend Christianity with the tongue; I see them driven from land to land, hunted from refuge to refuge, summoned to the felon's place, exposed to the whip, mocked as they utter amid the pain of martyrdom a confession of the faith which they have kept with such splendid constancy. The same bigotry that oppress the Jews falls tiger-like upon Christian nonconformists of purest lives and wipes out the Albigenses and the peaceful Vaudois, &quot;whose bones lie on the mountains cold.&quot; I see the clouds part slowly, and I hear a cry of protest against the bigot. The restraining hand of tolerance is laid upon the inquisitor, and the humanist utters a message of peace to the persecuted. Instead of the cry, &quot;Burn the heretic!&quot; men study the human soul with sympathy, and there enters into their hearts a new reverence for that which is unseen. 

The idea of brotherhood redawns upon the world with a broader significance than the narrow association of members in a sect or creed; and thinkers of great soul like Lessing challenge the world to say which is more godlike, the hatred and tooth-and-nail grapple of conflicting religions, or sweet accord and mutual helpfulness. Ancient prejudice of man against his brother-man wavers and retreats before the radiance of a more generous sentiment, which will not sacrifice men to forms, or rob them of the comfort and strength they find in their own beliefs. The heresy of one age becomes the orthodoxy of the next. Mere tolerance has given place to a sentiment of brotherhood between sincere men of all denominations. The optimist rejoices in the affectionate sympathy between Catholic heart and Protestant heart which finds a gratifying expression in the universal respect and warm admiration for Leo XIII on the part of good men the world over. The centenary celebrations of the births of Emerson and Channing are beautiful examples of the tribute which men of all creeds pay to the memory of a pure soul.

Thus in my outlook upon our times I find that I am glad to be a citizen of the world, as I regard my country, I find that to be an American is to be an optimist. I know the unhappy and unrighteous story of what has been done in the Philippines beneath our flag; but I believe that in the accidents of statecraft the best intelligence of the people sometimes fails to express itself. I read in history of Julius Caesar that during the civil wars there were millions of peaceful herdsmen and laborers who worked as long as they could, and fled before the advance of the armies that were led by the few, then waited until the danger was past, and returned to repair damages with patient hands. So the people are patient and honest, while their rulers stumble. I rejoice to see in the world and in this country a new and better patriotism than that which seeks the life of an enemy. It is a patriotism higher than that of the battle-field. It moves thousands to lay down their lives in social service, and every life so laid down brings us a step nearer the time when corn-fields shall no more be fields of battle. So when I heard of the cruel fighting in the Philippines, I did not despair, because I knew that the hearts of our people were not in that fight, and that sometime the hand of the destroyer must be stayed.

===Part III : The Practice of Optimism===
The test of all beliefs is their practical effect in life. It be true that optimism compels the world forward, and pessimism retards it, them it is dangerous to propagate a pessimistic philosophy. One who believes that the pain in the world outweighs the joy, and expresses that unhappy conviction, only adds to the pain. Schopenhauer is an enemy to the race. Even if he earnestly believed that this is the most wretched of possible worlds, he should not promulgate a doctrine which robs men of the incentive to fight with circumstance. If Life gave him ashes for bread, it was his fault. Life is a fair field, and the right will prosper if we stand by our guns.

Let pessimism once take hold of the mind, and life is all topsy-turvy, all vanity and vexation of spirit. There is no cure for individual or social disorder, except in forgetfulness and annihilation. &quot;Let us eat, drink and be merry,&quot; says the pessimist, &quot;for to-morrow we die.&quot; If I regarded my life from the point of view of the pessimist, I should be undone. I should seek in vain for the light that does not visit my eyes and the music that does not ring in my ears. I should beg night and day and never be satisfied. I should sit apart in awful solitude, a prey to fear and despair. But since I consider it a duty to myself and to others to be happy, I escape a misery worse than any physical deprivation.

Who shall dare let his incapacity for hope or goodness cast a shadow upon the courage of those who bear their burdens as if they were privileges? The optimist cannot fall back, cannot falter; for he knows his neighbor will be hindered by his failure to keep in line. He will therefore hold his place fearlessly and remember the duty of silence. Sufficient unto each heart is its own sorrow. He will take the iron claws of circumstance in his hand and use them as tools to break away the obstacle that block his path. He will work as if upon him alone depended the establishment of heaven and earth.

We have seen that the world's philosophers —the Sayers of the Word— were optimists; so also are the men of action and achievement —the Doers of the Word. Dr. Howe found his way to Laura Bridgman's soul because he began with the belief that he could reach it. English jurists had said that the deaf-blind were idiots in the eyes of the law. Behold what the optimist does. He converts a hard legal axiom; he looks behind the dull impassive clay and sees a human soul in bondage, and quietly, resolutely sets about its deliverance. His efforts are victorious. He creates intelligence out of idiocy and proves to the law that the deaf-blind man is a responsible being.

When Hauy offered to teach the blind to read, he was met by a pessimism that laughed at his folly. Had he not believed that the soul of man is mightier than the ignorance that fetters it, had he not been an optimist, he would not have turned the fingers of the blind into new instruments. No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the human spirit. St. Bernard was so deeply an optimist that he believed two hundred and fifty enlightened men could illuminate the darkness which overwhelmed the period of the Crusades; and the light of his faith broke like a new day upon western Europe. John Bosco, the benefactor of the poor and the friendless of Italian cities, was another optimist, another prophet who, perceiving a Divine Idea while it was yet afar, proclaimed it to his countrymen. Although they laughed at his vision and called him a madman, yet he worked on patiently, and with the labor of his hands he maintained a home for little street waifs. In the fervor of enthusiasm he predicted the wonderful movement which should result from his work. Even in the days before he had money or patronage, he drew glowing pictures of the splendid system of schools and hospitals which should spread from one end of Italy to the other, and he lived to see the organization of the San Salvador Society, which was the embodiment of his prophetic optimism. When Dr. Seguin declared his opinion that the feeble-minded could be taught, again people laughed, and in their complacent wisdom said he was no better than an idiot himself. But the noble optimist persevered, and by and by the reluctant pessimists saw that he whom they ridiculed had become one of the world's philanthropists. Thus the optimist believes, attempts, achieves. He stands always in the sunlight. Some day the wonderful, the inexpressible, arrives and shines upon him, and he is there to welcome it. His soul meets his own and beats a glad march to every new discovery, every fresh victory over difficulties, every addition to human knowledge and happiness.

We have found that our great philosophers and our great men of action are optimists. So, too, our most potent men of letters have been optimists in their books and in their lives. No pessimist ever won an audience commensurately wide with his genius, and many optimistic writers have been read and admired out of all measure to their talents, simply because they wrote of the sunlit side of life. Dickens, Lamb, Goldsmith, Irving, all the well-beloved and gentle humorists, were optimists. Swift, the pessimist, has never had as many readers as his towering genius should command, and indeed, when he comes down into our century and meets Thackeray, that generous optimist can hardly do him justice. In spite of the latter-day notoriety of the &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; of Omar Khayyam, we may set it down as a rule that he who would be heard must be a believer, must have a fundamental optimism in his philosophy. He may bluster and disagree and lament as Carlyle and Ruskin do sometimes; but a basic confidence in the good destiny of life and of the world must underlie his work.

Shakespeare is the prince of optimists. His tragedies are a revelation of moral order. In &quot;Lear&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; there is a looking forward to something better, some one is left at the end of the play to right wrong, restore society and build the state anew. The later plays, &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline,&quot; show a beautiful, placid optimism which delights in reconciliations and reunions and which plans for the triumph of external as well as internal good.

If Browning were less difficult to read, he would surely be the dominant poet in this century. I feel the ecstasy with which he exclaims, &quot;Oh, good gigantic smile o' the brown old earth this autumn morning!&quot; And how he sets my brain going when he says, because there is imperfection, there must be perfection; completeness must have come out of uncompleteness ; failure is an evidence of triumph for the fullness of the days. Yes, discord is, that harmony may be; pain destroys, that health may renew; perhaps I am deaf and blind that others likewise afflicted may see and hear with a more perfect sense! From Browning I learn that there is no lost good, and that makes it easier for me to go at life, right or wrong, do the best I know, and fear not. My heart responds proudly to his exhortation to pay gladly life's debt of pain, darkness and cold. Lift up your burden, it is God's gift, bear it nobly.

The man of letters whose voice is to prevail must be an optimist, and his voice often learns its message from his life. Stevenson's life has become a tradition only ten years after his death; he has taken his place among the heros, the bravest man of letters since Johnson and Lamb. I remember an hour when I was discouraged and ready to falter. For days I had been pegging away at a task which refused to get itself accomplished. In the midst of my perplexity I read an essay of Stevenson which made me feel as if I had been &quot;outing&quot; in the sunshine, instead of losing heart over a difficult task. I tried again with new courage and succeeded almost before I knew it. I have failed many times since; but I have never felt so disheartened as I did before that sturdy preacher gave me my lesson in the &quot;fashion of the smiling face.&quot;

Read Schopenhauer and Omar, and you will grow to find the world as hollow as they find it. Read Green's history of England, and the world is peopled with heroes. I never knew why Green's history thrilled me with the vigor of romance until I read his biography. Then I learned how his quick imagination transfigured the hard, bare facts of life into new and living dreams. When he and his wife were too poor to have a fire, he would sit before the unlit hearth and pretend that it was ablaze. &quot;Drill your thoughts,&quot; he said; &quot;shut out the gloomy and call in the bright. There is more wisdom in shutting one's eyes than your copybook philosophers will allow.&quot;

Every optimist moves along with progress and hastens it, while every pessimist would keep the worlds at a standstill. The consequence of pessimism in the life of a nation is the same as in the life of the individual. Pessimism kills the instinct that urges men to struggle against poverty, ignorance and crime, and dries up all the fountains of joy in the world. In imagination I leave the country which lifts up the manhood of the poor and I visit India, the underworld of fatalism —where three hundred million human beings, scarcely men, submerged in ignorance and misery, precipitate themselves still deeper into the pit. Why are they thus? Because they have for thousands of years been the victims of their philosophy, which teaches them that men are as grass, and the grass fadeth, and there is no more greenness on the earth. They sit in the shadow and let the circumstances they should master grip them, until they cease to be Men, and are made to dance and salaam like puppets in a play. After a little hour death comes and hurries them off to the grave, and other puppets with other &quot;pasteboard passions and desires&quot; take their place, and the show goes on for centuries.

Go to India and see what sort of civilization is developed when a nation lacks faith in progress and bows to the gods of darkness. Under the influence of Brahminism genius and ambition have been suppressed. There is no one to befriend the poor or to protect the fatherless and the widow. The sick lie untended. The blind know not how to see, nor the deaf to hear, and they are left by the roadside to die. In India it is a sin to teach the blind and the deaf because their affliction is regarded as a punishment for offenses in a previous state of existence. If I had been born in the midst of these fatalistic doctrines, I should still be in darkness, my life a desert-land where no caravan of thought might pass between my spirit and the world beyond.

The Hindoos believe in endurance, but not in resistance; therefore they have been subdued by strangers. Their history is a repetition of that Babylon. A nation from afar came with speed swiftly, and none stumbled, or slept, or slumbered, but they brought desolation upon the land, and took the stay and the staff from the people, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, and none delivered them. Woe, indeed, is the heritage of those who walk sad-thoughted and downcast through this radiant, soul delighting earth, blind to its beauty and deaf to its music, and of those who call evil good, and good evil, and put darkness for light, and light for darkness.

What care the weather-bronzed sons of the West, feeding the world from the plains of Dakota, for the Oars and the Brahmins? They would say to the Hindoos, &quot;Blot out your philosophy, dead for a thousand years, look with fresh eyes at Reality and Life, put away your Brahmins and your crooked gods, and seek diligently for Vishnu the Preserver.&quot;

Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement; nothing can be done without hope. When our forefathers laid the foundation of the American commonwealths, what nerved them to their task but a vision of a free community? Against the cold, inhospitable sky, across the wilderness white with snow, where lurked the hidden savage, gleamed the bow of promise, toward which they set their faces with the faith that levels mountains, fills up valleys, bridges rivers and carries civilization to the uttermost parts of the earth. Although the pioneers could not build according to the Hebraic ideal they saw, yet they gave the pattern of all that is most enduring in our country today. They brought to the wilderness the thinking mind, the printed book, the deep rooted desire for self-government and the English common law that judges alike the king and the subject, the law on which rests the whole structure of our society.

It is significant that the foundation of the law is optimistic. In Latin countries the court proceeds with a pessimistic bias. The prisoner is held guilty until he is proved innocent. In England and the United States there is an optimistic presumption that the accused is innocent until it is no longer possible to deny his guilt. Under our system, it is said, many criminals are acquitted; but it is surely better so than that many innocent persons should suffer. The pessimist cries, &quot;There is no enduring good in man! The tendency of all things is through perpetual loss to chaos in the end. If there was ever an idea of good in things evil, it was impotent, and the world rushes on to ruin.&quot; But behold, the law of the two most sober-minded, practical and law abiding nations on earth assumes the good in man and demands proof of the bad.

Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. The prophets of the world have been good of heart, or their standards would have stood naked in the field without a defender. Tolstoi's strictures lose power because they are pessimistic. If he had seen clearly the faults of America, and still believed in her capacity to overcome them, our people might have felt the stimulation of his censure. But the world turns its back on a hopeless prophet and listens to Emerson who takes in account the best qualities of the nation and attacks only the vices which no one can defend or deny. It listens to the strong man, Lincoln, who in times of doubt, trouble and need does not falter. He sees success afar, and by strenuous hope, by hoping against hope, inspires a nation. Through the night of despair he says, &quot;All is well,&quot; and thousands rest in his confidence. When such a man censures, and points to a fault, the nation obeys, and his words sink into the ears of men; but to the lamentations of the habitual Jeremiah the ear grows dull.

Our newspapers should remember this. The press is the pulpit of the modern world, and on the preachers who fill it much depends. If the protest of the press against unrighteous measures is to avail, then for ninety nine days the word of the preacher should be buoyant and of good cheer, so that on the hundredth day the voice of censure may be a hundred times strong. This was Lincoln's way. He knew the people; he believed in them and rested his faith on the justice and wisdom of the great majority. When in his rough and ready way he said, &quot;You can't fool all the people all the time,&quot; he expressed a great principle, the doctrine of faith in human nature.

The prophet is not without honor, save he be a pessimist. The ecstatic prophecies of Isaiah did far more to restore the exiles of Israel to their homes than the lamentations of Jeremiah did to deliver them from the hands of evil-doers.

Even on Christmas Day do men remember that Christ came as a prophet of good? His joyous optimism is like water to feverish lips, and has for its highest expression the eight beatitudes. It is because Christ is an optimist that for ages he has dominated the Western world. For nineteen centuries Christendom had gazed into his shining face and felt that all things work together for good. St. Paul, too, taught the faith which looks beyond the hardest things into the infinite horizon of heaven, where all limitations are lost in the light of perfect understanding. If you are born blind, search the treasures of darkness. They are more precious than the gold of Ophir. They are love and goodness and truth and hope, and their price is above rubies and sapphires.

Jesus utters and Paul proclaims a message of peace and a message of reason, a belief in the Idea, not in things, in love, not in conquest. The optimist is he who sees that men's actions are directed not by squadrons and armies, but by moral power, that the conquests of Alexander and Napoleon are less abiding than Newton's and Galileo's and St. Augustine's silent mastery of the world. Ideas are mightier than fire and sword. Noiselessly they propagate themselves from land to land, and mankind goes out and reaps the rich harvest and thanks God; but the achievements of the warrior are like his canvas city, &quot;to-day a camp, to-morrow all struck and vanished, a few pit-holes and heaps of straw.&quot; This was the gospel of Jesus two thousand years ago. Christmas Day is the festival of optimism.

Although there are still great evils which have not been subdued, and the optimist is not blind to them, yet he is full of hope. Despondency has no place in his creed, for he believes in the imperishable righteousness of God and the dignity of man. History records man's triumphant ascent. Each halt in his progress has been but a pause before a mighty leap forward. The time is not out of joint. If indeed some if the temples we worship in have fallen, we have built new ones on the sacred sites loftier and holier than those which have crumbled. If we have lost some of the heroic physical qualities of our ancestors, we have replaced them with a spiritual nobleness that turns aside wrath and binds up the wounds of the vanquished. All the past attainments of man are ours; and more, his day-dreams have become our clear realities. Therein lies our hope and sure faith.

As I stand in the sunshine if a sincere and earnest optimism, my imagination &quot;paints yet more glorious triumphs on the cloud-curtain of the future.&quot; Out of the fierce struggle and turmoil of contending systems and powers I see a brighter spiritual era slowly emerge —an era in which there shall be no England, no France, no Germany, no America, no this people or that, but one family, the human race; one law, peace; one need, harmony; one means, labor; one taskmaster, God.

If I should try to say anew the creed of the optimist, I should day something like this: &quot;I believe in God, I believe in man, I believe in the power of the spirit. I believe it is a sacred duty to encourage ourselves and others; to hold the tongue from any unhappy word against God's world, because no man has any right to complain of a universe which God made good, and which thousands of men have striven to keep good. I believe we should so act that we may draw nearer and more near the age when no man shall live at his ease while another suffers.&quot; These are the articles of my faith, and there is yet another on which all depends —to bear this faith above every tempest which overfloods it, and to make it a principal in disaster and through affliction. Optimism is the harmony between man's spirit and of God pronouncing His works good.

==Poem==
&lt;poem&gt;
In [[w:Xanadu|Xanadu]] did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree :
Where [[w:Alph|Alph]], the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
    Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round :
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

    But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
    Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !
    A savage place ! as holy and enchanted
    As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
    By woman wailing for her demon-lover !
    And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
    As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
    A mighty fountain&lt;ref&gt;{{user annotation|The following quote is thought to be a source for the poem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... in front, just under my feet, was the enchanting and amazing crystal fountain which incessantly threw up from dark rocky caverns below, tons of water every minute, forming a basin, capacious enough for large shallops to ride in, and a creek of four or five feet depth of water and near twenty yards over, which meanders six miles through green meadows, ... directly opposite to the mouth or outlet of the creek, is a continual and amazing ebullition where the waters are thrown up in such abundance and amazing force, as to jet and swell up two or three feet above the common surface: white sand and small particles of shells are thrown up with the waters near to the top, ... The ebullition is astonishing and continual, though its greatest force of fury intermits, regularly, for the space of thiry seconds of time: ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
    Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
    Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :
    And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
    It flung up momently the sacred river.
    Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
    Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
    Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
    And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :
    And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
    Ancestral voices prophesying war !

    The shadow of the dome of pleasure
    Floated midway on the waves ;
    Where was heard the mingled measure
    From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !
    A damsel with a dulcimer
    In a vision once I saw :
    It was an Abyssinian maid,
    And on her dulcimer she played,
    Singing of Mount Abora.
    Could I revive within me
    Her symphony and song,
    To such a deep delight 'twould win me,
That with music loud and long,
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !
And all who heard should see them there,
And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !
His flashing eyes, his floating hair !
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,
For he on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise.
&lt;/poem&gt;

}}
I heartily accept the motto, &quot;That government is best which governs least&quot;; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe—  &quot;That government is best which governs not at all&quot;; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The objections which have been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought against a standing government. The standing army is only an arm of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it. Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government as their tool; for, in the outset, the people would not have consented to this measure.

This American government— what is it but a tradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will. It is a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves. But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that idea of government which they have. Governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, for their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow. Yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. ''It'' does not keep the country free. ''It'' does not settle the West. ''It'' does not educate. The character inherent in the American people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has been said, when it is most expedient, the governed are most let alone by it. Trade and commerce, if they were not made of india-rubber, would never manage to bounce over the obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way; and, if one were to judge these men wholly by the effects of their actions and not partly by their intentions, they would deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads.

But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but ''at once'' a better government. Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect, and that will be one step toward obtaining it.

After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule is not because they are most likely to be in the right, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice, even as far as men understand it. Can there not be a government in which majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience?— in which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislation? Why has every man a conscience, then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation ''with'' a conscience. Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A common and natural result of an undue respect for law is, that you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys, and all, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, ay, against their common sense and consciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a palpitation of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined. Now, what are they? Men at all? or small movable forts and magazines, at the service of some unscrupulous man in power? Visit the Navy-Yard, and behold a marine, such a man as an American government can make, or such as it can make a man with its black arts— a mere shadow and reminiscence of humanity, a man laid out alive and standing, and already, as one may say, buried under arms with funeral accompaniments, though it may be,

: &lt;i&gt; &quot;Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
: As his corpse to the rampart we hurried;
: Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
: O'er the grave where our hero we buried.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;small&gt;[Charles Wolfe ''The Burial of Sir John Moore at Corunna '']&lt;/small&gt;

The mass of men serve the state thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies. They are the standing army, and the militia, jailers, constables, posse comitatus, etc. In most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well. Such command no more respect than men of straw or a lump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs. Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens. Others— as most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders— serve the state chiefly with their heads; and, as they rarely make any moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the devil, without ''intending'' it, as God. A very few— as heroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and ''men''— serve the state with their consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the most part; and they are commonly treated as enemies by it. A wise man will only be useful as a man, and will not submit to be &quot;clay,&quot; and &quot;stop a hole to keep the wind away,&quot; but leave that office to his dust at least:

: &lt;i&gt; &quot;I am too high-born to be propertied,
: To be a secondary at control,
: Or useful serving-man and instrument
: To any sovereign state throughout the world.&quot; &lt;/i&gt; &lt;small&gt; [William Shakespeare ''King John''] &lt;/small&gt; 

He who gives himself entirely to his fellow-men appears to them useless and selfish; but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a benefactor and philanthropist.

How does it become a man to behave toward this American government today? I answer, that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it. I cannot for an instant recognize that political organization as my government which is the ''slave's'' government also.

All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable. But almost all say that such is not the case now. But such was the case, they think, in the Revolution Of '75. If one were to tell me that this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports, it is most probable that I should not make an ado about it, for I can do without them. All machines have their friction; and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance the evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to make a stir about it. But when the friction comes to have its machine, and oppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine any longer. In other words, when a sixth of the population of a nation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves, and a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army, and subjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize. What makes this duty the more urgent is the fact that the country so overrun is not our own, but ours is the invading army.

Paley, a common authority with many on moral questions, in his chapter on the &quot;Duty of Submission to Civil Government,&quot; resolves all civil obligation into expediency; and he proceeds to say that &quot;so long as the interest of the whole society requires it, that is, so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconveniency, it is the will of God... that the established government be obeyed— and no longer. This principle being admitted, the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side, and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other.&quot; Of this, he says, every man shall judge for himself. But Paley appears never to have contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does not apply, in which a people, as well as an individual, must do justice, cost what it may. If I have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning man, I must restore it to him though I drown myself. This, according to Paley, would be inconvenient. But he that would save his life, in such a case, shall lose it. This people must cease to hold slaves, and to make war on Mexico, though it cost them their existence as a people.

In their practice, nations agree with Paley; but does any one think that Massachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis?

: &lt;i&gt; &quot;A drab of state, a cloth-o'-silver slut,
: To have her train borne up, and her soul trail in the dirt.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;small&gt; [Cyril Tourneur ''The Revengers Tragadie ''] &lt;/small&gt; 

Practically speaking, the opponents to a reform in Massachusetts are not a hundred thousand politicians at the South, but a hundred thousand merchants and farmers here, who are more interested in commerce and agriculture than they are in humanity, and are not prepared to do justice to the slave and to Mexico, ''cost what it may''. I quarrel not with far-off foes, but with those who, near at home, cooperate with, and do the bidding of those far away, and without whom the latter would be harmless. We are accustomed to say, that the mass of men are unprepared; but improvement is slow, because the few are not materially wiser or better than the many. It is not so important that many should be as good as you, as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere; for that will leaven the whole lump. There are thousands who are ''in opinion'' opposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them; who, esteeming themselves children of Washington and Franklin, sit down with their hands in their pockets, and say that they know not what to do, and do nothing; who even postpone the question of freedom to the question of free trade, and quietly read the prices-current along with the latest advices from Mexico, after dinner, and, it may be, fall asleep over them both. What is the price-current of an honest man and patriot today? They hesitate, and they regret, and sometimes they petition; but they do nothing in earnest and with effect. They will wait, well disposed, for others to remedy the evil, that they may no longer have it to regret. At most, they give only a cheap vote, and a feeble countenance and God-speed, to the right, as it goes by them. There are nine hundred and ninety-nine patrons of virtue to one virtuous man. But it is easier to deal with the real possessor of a thing than with the temporary guardian of it.

All voting is a sort of gaming, like checkers or backgammon, with a slight moral tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moral questions; and betting naturally accompanies it. The character of the voters is not staked. I cast my vote, perchance, as I think right; but I am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail. I am willing to leave it to the majority. Its obligation, therefore, never exceeds that of expediency. Even voting ''for the right'' is ''doing'' nothing for it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail. A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority. There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men. When the majority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery, it will be because they are indifferent to slavery, or because there is but little slavery left to be abolished by their vote. ''They'' will then be the only slaves. Only ''his'' vote can hasten the abolition of slavery who asserts his own freedom by his vote.

I hear of a convention to be held at Baltimore, or elsewhere, for the selection of a candidate for the Presidency, made up chiefly of editors, and men who are politicians by profession; but I think, what is it to any independent, intelligent, and respectable man what decision they may come to? Shall we not have the advantage of his wisdom and honesty, nevertheless? Can we not count upon some independent votes? Are there not many individuals in the country who do not attend conventions? But no: I find that the respectable man, so called, has immediately drifted from his position, and despairs of his country, when his country has more reason to despair of him. He forthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected as the only ''available'' one, thus proving that he is himself ''available'' for any purposes of the demagogue. His vote is of no more worth than that of any unprincipled foreigner or hireling native, who may have been bought. O for a man who is a man, and, as my neighbor says, has a bone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through! Our statistics are at fault: the population has been returned too large. How many men are there to a square thousand miles in this country? Hardly one. Does not America offer any inducement for men to settle here? The American has dwindled into an Odd Fellow—  one who may be known by the development of his organ of gregariousness, and a manifest lack of intellect and cheerful self-reliance; whose first and chief concern, on coming into the world, is to see that the almshouses are in good repair; and, before yet he has lawfully donned the virile garb, to collect a fund for the support of the widows and orphans that may be; who, in short, ventures to live only by the aid of the Mutual Insurance company, which has promised to bury him decently.

It is not a man's duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous, wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, &quot;I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico;— see if I would go&quot;; and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute. The soldier is applauded who refuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain the unjust government which makes the war; is applauded by those whose own act and authority he disregards and sets at naught; as if the state were penitent to that degree that it {{Tooltip|differed|hired}} one to scourge it while it sinned, but not to that degree that it left off sinning for a moment. Thus, under the name of Order and Civil Government, we are all made at last to pay homage to and support our own meanness. After the first blush of sin comes its indifference; and from immoral it becomes, as it were, ''un''moral, and not quite unnecessary to that life which we have made.

The broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterested virtue to sustain it. The slight reproach to which the virtue of patriotism is commonly liable, the noble are most likely to incur. Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform. Some are petitioning the State to dissolve the Union, to disregard the requisitions of the President. Why do they not dissolve it themselves— the union between themselves and the State— and refuse to pay their quota into its treasury? Do not they stand in the same relation to the State that the State does to the Union? And have not the same reasons prevented the State from resisting the Union which have prevented them from resisting the State?

How can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely, and enjoy ''it''? Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he is aggrieved? If you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbor, you do not rest satisfied with knowing that you are cheated, or with saying that you are cheated, or even with petitioning him to pay you your due; but you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount, and see that you are never cheated again. Action from principle, the perception and the performance of right, changes things and relations; it is essentially revolutionary, and does not consist wholly with anything which was. It not only divides States and churches, it divides families; ay, it divides the ''individual'', separating the diabolical in him from the divine.

Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once? Men generally, under such a government as this, think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them. They think that, if they should resist, the remedy would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the government itself that the remedy ''is'' worse than the evil. ''It'' makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist before it is hurt? Why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the alert to point out its faults, and ''do'' better than it would have them? Why does it always crucify Christ, and excommunicate Copernicus and Luther, and pronounce Washington and Franklin rebels?

One would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority was the only offence never contemplated by government; else, why has it not assigned its definite, its suitable and proportionate, penalty? If a man who has no property refuses but once to earn nine shillings for the State, he is put in prison for a period unlimited by any law that I know, and determined only by the discretion of those who placed him there; but if he should steal ninety times nine shillings from the State, he is soon permitted to go at large again.

If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth— certainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.

As for adopting the ways which the State has provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such ways. They take too much time, and a man's life will be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has not everything to do, but something; and because he cannot do ''everything'', it is not necessary that he should do ''something'' wrong. It is not my business to be petitioning the Governor or the Legislature any more than it is theirs to petition me; and if they should not bear my petition, what should I do then? But in this case the State has provided no way: its very Constitution is the evil. This may seem to be harsh and stubborn and unconciliatory; but it is to treat with the utmost kindness and consideration the only spirit that can appreciate or deserves it. So is all change for the better, like birth and death, which convulse the body.

I do not hesitate to say, that those who call themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their support, both in person and property, from the government of Massachusetts, and not wait till they constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the right to prevail through them. I think that it is enough if they have God on their side, without waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already.

I meet this American government, or its representative, the State government, directly, and face to face, once a year— no more— in the person of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man situated as I am necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly, Recognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual, and, in the present posture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treating with it on this head, of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it, is to deny it then. My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with— for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel— and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well what he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he shall treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action. I know this well, that if one thousand, if one hundred, if ten men whom I could name— if ten ''honest'' men only— ay, if ''one'' HONEST man, in this State of Massachusetts, ''ceasing to hold slaves'', were actually to withdraw from this copartnership, and be locked up in the county jail therefor, it would be the abolition of slavery in America. For it matters not how small the beginning may seem to be: what is once well done is done forever. But we love better to talk about it: that we say is our mission. Reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its service, but not one man. If my esteemed neighbor, the State's ambassador, who will devote his days to the settlement of the question of human rights in the Council Chamber, instead of being threatened with the prisons of Carolina, were to sit down the prisoner of Massachusetts, that State which is so anxious to foist the sin of slavery upon her sister— though at present she can discover only an act of inhospitality to be the ground of a quarrel with her— the Legislature would not wholly waive the subject the following winter.

Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison. The proper place today, the only place which Massachusetts has provided for her freer and less desponding spirits, is in her prisons, to be put out and locked out of the State by her own act, as they have already put themselves out by their principles. It is there that the fugitive slave, and the Mexican prisoner on parole, and the Indian come to plead the wrongs of his race should find them; on that separate, but more free and honorable, ground, where the State places those who are not ''with'' her, but ''against'' her— the only house in a slave State in which a free man can abide with honor. If any think that their influence would be lost there, and their voices no longer afflict the ear of the State, that they would not be as an enemy within its walls, they do not know by how much truth is stronger than error, nor how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injustice who has experienced a little in his own person. Cast your whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence. A minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority then; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight. If the alternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and slavery, the State will not hesitate which to choose. If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. If the tax-gatherer, or any other public officer, asks me, as one has done, &quot;But what shall I do?&quot; my answer is, &quot;If you really wish to do anything, resign your office.&quot; When the subject has refused allegiance, and the officer has resigned his office, then the revolution is accomplished. But even suppose blood should flow. Is there not a sort of blood shed when the conscience is wounded? Through this wound a man's real manhood and immortality flow out, and he bleeds to an everlasting death. I see this blood flowing now.

I have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender, rather than the seizure of his goods— though both will serve the same purpose— because they who assert the purest right, and consequently are most dangerous to a corrupt State, commonly have not spent much time in accumulating property. To such the State renders comparatively small service, and a slight tax is wont to appear exorbitant, particularly if they are obliged to earn it by special labor with their hands. If there were one who lived wholly without the use of money, the State itself would hesitate to demand it of him. But the rich man— not to make any invidious comparison— is always sold to the institution which makes him rich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue; for money comes between a man and his objects, and obtains them for him; and it was certainly no great virtue to obtain it. It puts to rest many questions which he would otherwise be taxed to answer; while the only new question which it puts is the hard but superfluous one, how to spend it. Thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet. The opportunities of living are diminished in proportion as what are called the &quot;means&quot; are increased. The best thing a man can do for his culture when he is rich is to endeavor to carry out those schemes which he entertained when he was poor. Christ answered the Herodians according to their condition. &quot;Show me the tribute-money,&quot; said he;— and one took a penny out of his pocket;— if you use money which has the image of Caesar on it, and which he has made current and valuable, that is, ''if you are men of the State'', and gladly enjoy the advantages of Caesar's government, then pay him back some of his own when he demands it. &quot;Render therefore to Caesar that which is Caesar's, and to God those things which are God's&quot;— leaving them no wiser than before as to which was which; for they did not wish to know.

When I converse with the freest of my neighbors, I perceive that, whatever they may say about the magnitude and seriousness of the question, and their regard for the public tranquillity, the long and the short of the matter is, that they cannot spare the protection of the existing government, and they dread the consequences to their property and families of disobedience to it. For my own part, I should not like to think that I ever rely on the protection of the State. But, if I deny the authority of the State when it presents its tax-bill, it will soon take and waste all my property, and so harass me and my children without end. This is hard. This makes it impossible for a man to live honestly, and at the same time comfortably, in outward respects. It will not be worth the while to accumulate property; that would be sure to go again. You must hire or squat somewhere, and raise but a small crop, and eat that soon. You must live within yourself, and depend upon yourself always tucked up and ready for a start, and not have many affairs. A man may grow rich in Turkey even, if he will be in all respects a good subject of the Turkish government. Confucius said: &quot;If a state is governed by the principles of reason, poverty and misery are subjects of shame; if a state is not governed by the principles of reason, riches and honors are the subjects of shame.&quot; No: until I want the protection of Massachusetts to be extended to me in some distant Southern port, where my liberty is endangered, or until I am bent solely on building up an estate at home by peaceful enterprise, I can afford to refuse allegiance to Massachusetts, and her right to my property and life. It costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty of disobedience to the State than it would to obey. I should feel as if I were worth less in that case.

Some years ago, the State met me in behalf of the Church, and commanded me to pay a certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whose preaching my father attended, but never I myself. &quot;Pay,&quot; it said, &quot;or be locked up in the jail.&quot; I declined to pay. But, unfortunately, another man saw fit to pay it. I did not see why the schoolmaster should be taxed to support the priest, and not the priest the schoolmaster; for I was not the State's schoolmaster, but I supported myself by voluntary subscription. I did not see why the lyceum should not present its tax-bill, and have the State to back its demand, as well as the Church. However, at the request of the selectmen, I condescended to make some such statement as this in writing:— &quot;Know all men by these presents, that I, Henry Thoreau, do not wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated society which I have not joined.&quot; This I gave to the town clerk; and he has it. The State, having thus learned that I did not wish to be regarded as a member of that church, has never made a like demand on me since; though it said that it must adhere to its original presumption that time. If I had known how to name them, I should then have signed off in detail from all the societies which I never signed on to; but I did not know where to find a complete list.

I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once on this account, for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I wondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to, and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way. I saw that, if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through before they could get to be as free as I was. I did not for a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax. They plainly did not know how to treat me, but behaved like persons who are underbred. In every threat and in every compliment there was a blunder; for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall. I could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations, which followed them out again without let or hindrance, and they were really all that was dangerous. As they could not reach me, they had resolved to punish my body; just as boys, if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was half-witted, that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons, and that it did not know its friends from its foes, and I lost all my remaining respect for it, and pitied it.

Thus the State never intentionally confronts a man's sense, intellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is not armed with superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. I was not born to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who is the strongest. What force has a multitude? They only can force me who obey a higher law than I. They force me to become like themselves. I do not hear of ''men'' being ''forced'' to live this way or that by masses of men. What sort of life were that to live? When I meet a government which says to me, &quot;Your money or your life,&quot; why should I be in haste to give it my money? It may be in a great strait, and not know what to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do. It is not worth the while to snivel about it. I am not responsible for the successful working of the machinery of society. I am not the son of the engineer. I perceive that, when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side, the one does not remain inert to make way for the other, but both obey their own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they can, till one, perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a plant cannot live according to its nature, it dies; and so a man.

The night in prison was novel and interesting enough. The prisoners in their shirt-sleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the doorway, when I entered. But the jailer said, &quot;Come, boys, it is time to lock up&quot;; and so they dispersed, and I heard the sound of their steps returning into the hollow apartments. My room-mate was introduced to me by the jailer as &quot;a first-rate fellow and a clever man.&quot; When the door was locked, he showed me where to hang my hat, and how he managed matters there. The rooms were whitewashed once a month; and this one, at least, was the whitest, most simply furnished, and probably the neatest apartment in the town. He naturally wanted to know where I came from, and what brought me there; and, when I had told him, I asked him in my turn how he came there, presuming him to be an honest man, of course; and, as the world goes, I believe he was. &quot;Why,&quot; said he, &quot;they accuse me of burning a barn; but I never did it.&quot; As near as I could discover, he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk, and smoked his pipe there; and so a barn was burnt. He had the reputation of being a clever man, had been there some three months waiting for his trial to come on, and would have to wait as much longer; but he was quite domesticated and contented, since he got his board for nothing, and thought that he was well treated.

He occupied one window, and I the other; and I saw that if one stayed there long, his principal business would be to look out the window. I had soon read all the tracts that were left there, and examined where former prisoners had broken out, and where a grate had been sawed off, and heard the history of the various occupants of that room; for I found that even here there was a history and a gossip which never circulated beyond the walls of the jail. Probably this is the only house in the town where verses are composed, which are afterward printed in a circular form, but not published. I was shown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been detected in an attempt to escape, who avenged themselves by singing them.

I pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as I could, for fear I should never see him again; but at length he showed me which was my bed, and left me to blow out the lamp.

It was like travelling into a far country, such as I had never expected to behold, to lie there for one night. It seemed to me that I never had heard the town clock strike before, nor the evening sounds of the village; for we slept with the windows open, which were inside the grating. It was to see my native village in the light of the Middle Ages, and our Concord was turned into a Rhine stream, and visions of knights and castles passed before me. They were the voices of old burghers that I heard in the streets. I was an involuntary spectator and auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of the adjacent village inn— a wholly new and rare experience to me. It was a closer view of my native town. I was fairly inside of it. I never had seen its institutions before. This is one of its peculiar institutions; for it is a shire town. I began to comprehend what its inhabitants were about.

In the morning, our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door, in small oblong-square tin pans, made to fit, and holding a pint of chocolate, with brown bread, and an iron spoon. When they called for the vessels again, I was green enough to return what bread I had left; but my comrade seized it, and said that I should lay that up for lunch or dinner. Soon after he was let out to work at haying in a neighboring field, whither he went every day, and would not be back till noon; so he bade me good-day, saying that he doubted if he should see me again.

When I came out of prison— for some one interfered, and paid that tax— I did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common, such as he observed who went in a youth and emerged a tottering and gray-headed man; and yet a change had to my eyes come over the scene— the town, and State, and country— greater than any that mere time could effect. I saw yet more distinctly the State in which I lived. I saw to what extent the people among whom I lived could be trusted as good neighbors and friends; that their friendship was for summer weather only; that they did not greatly propose to do right; that they were a distinct race from me by their prejudices and superstitions, as the Chinamen and Malays are; that in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks, not even to their property; that after all they were not so noble but they treated the thief as he had treated them, and hoped, by a certain outward observance and a few prayers, and by walking in a particular straight though useless path from time to time, to save their souls. This may be to judge my neighbors harshly; for I believe that many of them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail in their village.

It was formerly the custom in our village, when a poor debtor came out of jail, for his acquaintances to salute him, looking through their fingers, which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window, &quot;How do ye do?&quot; My neighbors did not thus salute me, but first looked at me, and then at one another, as if I had returned from a long journey. I was put into jail as I was going to the shoemaker's to get a shoe which was mended. When I was let out the next morning, I proceeded to finish my errand, and, having put on my mended shoe, joined a huckleberry party, who were impatient to put themselves under my conduct; and in half an hour— for the horse was soon tackled— was in the midst of a huckleberry field, on one of our highest hills, two miles off, and then the State was nowhere to be seen.

This is the whole history of &quot;My Prisons.&quot;

I have never declined paying the highway tax, because I am as desirous of being a good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject; and as for supporting schools, I am doing my part to educate my fellow-countrymen now. It is for no particular item in the tax-bill that I refuse to pay it. I simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually. I do not care to trace the course of my dollar, if I could, till it buys a man or a musket to shoot one with— the dollar is innocent— but I am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance. In fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after my fashion, though I will still make what use and get what advantage of her I can, as is usual in such cases.

If others pay the tax which is demanded of me, from a sympathy with the State, they do but what they have already done in their own case, or rather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the State requires. If they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed, to save his property, or prevent his going to jail, it is because they have not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings interfere with the public good.

This, then, is my position at present. But one cannot be too much on his guard in such a case, lest his action be biased by obstinacy or an undue regard for the opinions of men. Let him see that he does only what belongs to himself and to the hour.

I think sometimes, Why, this people mean well, they are only ignorant; they would do better if they knew how: why give your neighbors this pain to treat you as they are not inclined to? But I think again, This is no reason why I should do as they do, or permit others to suffer much greater pain of a different kind. Again, I sometimes say to myself, When many millions of men, without heat, without ill will, without personal feeling of any kind, demand of you a few shillings only, without the possibility, such is their constitution, of retracting or altering their present demand, and without the possibility, on your side, of appeal to any other millions, why expose yourself to this overwhelming brute force? You do not resist cold and hunger, the winds and the waves, thus obstinately; you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities. You do not put your head into the fire. But just in proportion as I regard this as not wholly a brute force, but partly a human force, and consider that I have relations to those millions as to so many millions of men, and not of mere brute or inanimate things, I see that appeal is possible, first and instantaneously, from them to the Maker of them, and, secondly, from them to themselves. But if I put my head deliberately into the fire, there is no appeal to fire or to the Maker of fire, and I have only myself to blame. If I could convince myself that I have any right to be satisfied with men as they are, and to treat them accordingly, and not according, in some respects, to my requisitions and expectations of what they and I ought to be, then, like a good Mussulman and fatalist, I should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are, and say it is the will of God. And, above all, there is this difference between resisting this and a purely brute or natural force, that I can resist this with some effect; but I cannot expect, like Orpheus, to change the nature of the rocks and trees and beasts.

I do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation. I do not wish to split hairs, to make fine distinctions, or set myself up as better than my neighbors. I seek rather, I may say, even an excuse for conforming to the laws of the land. I am but too ready to conform to them. Indeed, I have reason to suspect myself on this head; and each year, as the tax-gatherer comes round, I find myself disposed to review the acts and position of the general and State governments, and the spirit of the people, to discover a pretext for conformity.

: &lt;i&gt; &quot;We must affect our country as our parents,
: And if at any time we alienate
: Our love or industry from doing it honor,
: We must respect effects and teach the soul
: Matter of conscience and religion,
: And not desire of rule or benefit.&quot; &lt;/i&gt; &lt;small&gt; [George Peele '' Battle of Alcazar '']&lt;/small&gt; 

I believe that the State will soon be able to take all my work of this sort out of my hands, and then I shall be no better a patriot than my fellow-countrymen. Seen from a lower point of view, the Constitution, with all its faults, is very good; the law and the courts are very respectable; even this State and this American government are, in many respects, very admirable, and rare things, to be thankful for, such as a great many have described them; but seen from a point of view a little higher, they are what I have described them; seen from a higher still, and the highest, who shall say what they are, or that they are worth looking at or thinking of at all?

However, the government does not concern me much, and I shall bestow the fewest possible thoughts on it. It is not many moments that I live under a government, even in this world. If a man is thought-free, fancy-free, imagination-free, that which is ''not'' never for a long time appearing ''to be'' to him, unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt him.

I know that most men think differently from myself; but those whose lives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindred subjects content me as little as any. Statesmen and legislators, standing so completely within the institution, never distinctly and nakedly behold it. They speak of moving society, but have no resting-place without it. They may be men of a certain experience and discrimination, and have no doubt invented ingenious and even useful systems, for which we sincerely thank them; but all their wit and usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits. They are wont to forget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency. Webster never goes behind government, and so cannot speak with authority about it. His words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no essential reform in the existing government; but for thinkers, and those who legislate for all time, he never once glances at the subject. I know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this theme would soon reveal the limits of his mind's range and hospitality. Yet, compared with the cheap professions of most reformers, and the still cheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general, his are almost the only sensible and valuable words, and we thank Heaven for him. Comparatively, he is always strong, original, and, above all, practical. Still, his quality is not wisdom, but prudence. The lawyer's truth is not Truth, but consistency or a consistent expediency. Truth is always in harmony with herself, and is not concerned chiefly to reveal the justice that may consist with wrong-doing. He well deserves to be called, as he has been called, the Defender of the Constitution. There are really no blows to be given by him but defensive ones. He is not a leader, but a follower. His leaders are the men of '87— &quot;I have never made an effort,&quot; he says, &quot;and never propose to make an effort; I have never countenanced an effort, and never mean to countenance an effort, to disturb the arrangement as originally made, by which the various States came into the Union.&quot; Still thinking of the sanction which the Constitution gives to slavery, he says, &quot;Because it was a part of the original compact— let it stand.&quot; Notwithstanding his special acuteness and ability, he is unable to take a fact out of its merely political relations, and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposed of by the intellect— what, for instance, it behooves a man to do here in America today with regard to slavery— but ventures, or is driven, to make some such desperate answer as the following, while professing to speak absolutely, and as a private man— from which what new and singular code of social duties might be inferred? &quot;The manner,&quot; says he, &quot;in which the governments of those States where slavery exists are to regulate it is for their own consideration, under their responsibility to their constituents, to the general laws of propriety, humanity, and justice, and to God. Associations formed elsewhere, springing from a feeling of humanity, or any other cause, have nothing whatever to do with it. They have never received any encouragement from me, and they never will.&quot;

They who know of no purer sources of truth, who have traced up its stream no higher, stand, and wisely stand, by the Bible and the Constitution, and drink at it there with reverence and humility; but they who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or that pool, gird up their loins once more, and continue their pilgrimage toward its fountain-head.

No man with a genius for legislation has appeared in America. They are rare in the history of the world. There are orators, politicians, and eloquent men, by the thousand; but the speaker has not yet opened his mouth to speak who is capable of settling the much-vexed questions of the day. We love eloquence for its own sake, and not for any truth which it may utter, or any heroism it may inspire. Our legislators have not yet learned the comparative value of free trade and of freedom, of union, and of rectitude, to a nation. They have no genius or talent for comparatively humble questions of taxation and finance, commerce and manufactures and agriculture. If we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in Congress for our guidance, uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people, America would not long retain her rank among the nations. For eighteen hundred years, though perchance I have no right to say it, the New Testament has been written; yet where is the legislator who has wisdom and practical talent enough to avail himself of the light which it sheds on the science of legislation?

The authority of government, even such as I am willing to submit to— for I will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than I, and in many things even those who neither know nor can do so well— is still an impure one: to be strictly just, it must have the sanction and consent of the governed. It can have no pure right over my person and property but what I concede to it. The progress from an absolute to a limited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to a democracy, is a progress toward a true respect for the individual. Even the Chinese philosopher was wise enough to regard the individual as the basis of the empire. Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in government? Is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man? There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly. I please myself with imagining a State at least which can afford to be just to all men, and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbor; which even would not think it inconsistent with its own repose if a few were to live aloof from it, not meddling with it, nor embraced by it, who fulfilled all the duties of neighbors and fellow-men. A State which bore this kind of fruit, and suffered it to drop off as fast as it ripened, would prepare the way for a still more perfect and glorious State, which also I have imagined, but not yet anywhere seen.

==ESSAY II: ''Self-Reliance''==

I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment they instil is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, —that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,—  and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another. 

There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope. 

Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark. 

What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text, in the face and behaviour of children, babes, and even brutes! That divided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not. Their mind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in their faces, we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth and puberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand by itself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to you and me. Hark! in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic. It seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries. Bashful or bold, then, he will know how to make us seniors very unnecessary. 

The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy attitude of human nature. A boy is in the parlour what the pit is in the playhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their merits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never about consequences, about interests: he gives an independent, genuine verdict. You must court him: he does not court you. But the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat, he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass again into his neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges, and having observed, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence, must always be formidable. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private, but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men, and put them in fear. 

These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. 

Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested,— &quot;But these impulses may be from below, not from above.&quot; I replied, &quot;They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil's child, I will live then from the Devil.&quot; No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition, as if every thing were titular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from Barbadoes, why should I not say to him, ‘Go love thy infant; love thy wood-chopper: be good-natured and modest: have that grace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is spite at home.’ Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some edge to it, —else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be preached as the counteraction of the doctrine of love when that pules and whines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my genius calls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, Whim. I hope it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I exclude company. Then, again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison, if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots; and the thousandfold Relief Societies; —though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold. 

Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule. There is the man and his virtues. Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world,—as invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.

What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.

The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers,—under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are: and of course so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what a blind-man's-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect I anticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new spontaneous word? Do I not know that with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution he will do no such thing? Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not where to begin to set them right. Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere. We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean &quot;the foolish face of praise,&quot; the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease, in answer to conversation which does not interest us. The muscles, not spontaneously moved but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face, with the most disagreeable sensation.

For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend's parlor. If this aversion had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs. Yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous and prudent, for they are timid, as being very vulnerable themselves. But when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.

The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.

But why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity, yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.— 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' —Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. 

I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him. A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza; —read it forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing. In this pleasing, contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not, and see it not. My book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects. The swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment. 

There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost sight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought. One tendency unites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future. If I can be firm enough to-day to do right, and scorn eyes, I must have done so much right before as to defend me now. Be it how it will, do right now. Always scorn appearances, and you always may. The force of character is cumulative. All the foregone days of virtue work their health into this. What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field, which so fills the imagination? The consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind. They shed an united light on the advancing actor. He is attended as by a visible escort of angels. That is it which throws thunder into [[w:William Fitzhugh|Chatham]]'s voice, and dignity into [[w:George Washington|Washington]]'s port, and America into [[w:John Adams|Adams]]'s eye. Honor is venerable to us because it is no ephemeris. It is always ancient virtue. We worship it to-day because it is not of to-day. We love it and pay it homage, because it is not a trap for our love and homage, but is self-dependent, self-derived, and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young person. 

I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward. Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan fife. Let us never bow and apologize more. A great man is coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to please me. I will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it kind, I would make it true. Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom, and trade, and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures you, and all men, and all events. Ordinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person. Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the whole creation. The man must be so much, that he must make all circumstances indifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design; —and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients. A man Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius, that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man. An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; as, [[w:Christian monasticism|Monachism]], of the [[w:Anthony the Great|Hermit Antony]]; the [[w:Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], of [[w:Martin Luther|Luther]]; [[w:Religious Society of Friends|Quakerism]], of [[w:George Fox|Fox]]; [[w:Methodism|Methodism]], of [[w:John Wesley|Wesley]]; [[w:Abolitionism|Abolition]], of [[w:Thomas Clarkson|Clarkson]]. [[w:Scipio Africanus|Scipio]], Milton called &quot;the height of Rome&quot;; and all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons. 

Let a man then know his worth, and keep things under his feet. Let him not peep or steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or an interloper, in the world which exists for him. But the man in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seem to say like that, ‘Who are you, Sir?’ Yet they all are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take possession. The picture waits for my verdict: it is not to command me, but I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke's house, washed and dressed and laid in the duke's bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact, that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason, and finds himself a true prince. 

Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history, our imagination plays us false. Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common day's work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total of both is the same. Why all this deference to Alfred, and Scanderbeg, and Gustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out virtue? As great a stake depends on your private act to-day, as followed their public and renowned steps. When private men shall act with original views, the lustre will be transferred from the actions of kings to those of gentlemen. 

The world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the eyes of nations. It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale of men and things, and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money but with honor, and represent the law in his person, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right and comeliness, the right of every man. 

The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? What is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear? The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are tuitions. In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin. For, the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them, and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed. We first share the life by which things exist, and afterwards see them as appearances in nature, and forget that we have shared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom, and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm. Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind, and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed. My wilful actions and acquisitions are but roving; —the idlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command my curiosity and respect. Thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for, they do not distinguish between perception and notion. They fancy that I choose to see this or that thing. But perception is not whimsical, but fatal. If I see a trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time, all mankind, —although it may chance that no one has seen it before me. For my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun. 

The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure, that it is profane to seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh he should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the whole. Whenever a mind is simple, and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away, —means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour. All things are made sacred by relation to it, —one as much as another. All things are dissolved to their centre by their cause, and, in the universal miracle, petty and particular miracles disappear. If, therefore, a man claims to know and speak of God, and carries you backward to the phraseology of some old mouldered nation in another country, in another world, believe him not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and completion? Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being? Whence, then, this worship of the past? The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul. Time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is light; where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury, if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming. 

Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say `I think,' `I am,' but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time. 

This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear God himself, unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on a few lives. We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of talents and character they chance to see, —painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered these sayings, they understand them, and are willing to let the words go; for, at any time, they can use words as good when occasion comes. If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak. When we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden the memory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn. 

And now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid; probably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off remembering of the intuition. That thought, by what I can now nearest approach to say it, is this. When good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the foot-prints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not hear any name;——the way, the thought, the good, shall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example and experience. You take the way from man, not to man. All persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike beneath it. There is somewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision, there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well. Vast spaces of nature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea, —long intervals of time, years, centuries, —are of no account. This which I think and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and what is called life, and what is called death. 

Life only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. This one fact the world hates, that the soul becomes; for that for ever degrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside. Why, then, do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch as the soul is present, there will be power not confident but agent. To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking. Speak rather of that which relies, because it works and is. Who has more obedience than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger. Round him I must revolve by the gravitation of spirits. We fancy it rhetoric, when we speak of eminent virtue. We do not yet see that virtue is Height, and that a man or a company of men, plastic and permeable to principles, by the law of nature must overpower and ride all cities, nations, kings, rich men, poets, who are not. 

This is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this, as on every topic, the resolution of all into the ever-blessed ONE. Self-existence is the attribute of the Supreme Cause, and it constitutes the measure of good by the degree in which it enters into all lower forms. All things real are so by so much virtue as they contain. Commerce, husbandry, hunting, whaling, war, eloquence, personal weight, are somewhat, and engage my respect as examples of its presence and impure action. I see the same law working in nature for conservation and growth. Power is in nature the essential measure of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself. The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise and orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are demonstrations of the self-sufficing, and therefore self-relying soul. 

Thus all concentrates: let us not rove; let us sit at home with the cause. Let us stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books and institutions, by a simple declaration of the divine fact. Bid the invaders take the shoes from off their feet, for God is here within. Let our simplicity judge them, and our docility to our own law demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches. 

But now we are a mob. Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his genius admonished to stay at home, to put itself in communication with the internal ocean, but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the urns of other men. We must go alone. I like the silent church before the service begins, better than any preaching. How far off, how cool, how chaste the persons look, begirt each one with a precinct or sanctuary! So let us always sit. Why should we assume the faults of our friend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around our hearth, or are said to have the same blood? All men have my blood, and I have all men's. Not for that will I adopt their petulance or folly, even to the extent of being ashamed of it. But your isolation must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation. At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles. Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all knock at once at thy closet door, and say,— `Come out unto us.' But keep thy state; come not into their confusion. The power men possess to annoy me, I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can come near me but through my act. &quot;What we love that we have, but by desire we bereave ourselves of the love.&quot; 

If we cannot at once rise to the sanctities of obedience and faith, let us at least resist our temptations; let us enter into the state of war, and wake Thor and Woden, courage and constancy, in our Saxon breasts. This is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth. Check this lying hospitality and lying affection. Live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse. Say to them, O father, O mother, O wife, O brother, O friend, I have lived with you after appearances hitherto. Henceforward I am the truth's. Be it known unto you that henceforward I obey no law less than the eternal law. I will have no covenants but proximities. I shall endeavour to nourish my parents, to support my family, to be the chaste husband of one wife, —but these relations I must fill after a new and unprecedented way. I appeal from your customs. I must be myself. I cannot break myself any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall be the happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you should. I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that what is deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly rejoices me, and the heart appoints. If you are noble, I will love you; if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions. If you are true, but not in the same truth with me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own. I do this not selfishly, but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest, and mine, and all men's, however long we have dwelt in lies, to live in truth. Does this sound harsh to-day? You will soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine, and, if we follow the truth, it will bring us out safe at last. —But so you may give these friends pain. Yes, but I cannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their sensibility. Besides, all persons have their moments of reason, when they look out into the region of absolute truth; then will they justify me, and do the same thing. 

The populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism; and the bold sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the law of consciousness abides. There are two confessionals, in one or the other of which we must be shriven. You may fulfil your round of duties by clearing yourself in the direct, or in the reflex way. Consider whether you have satisfied your relations to father, mother, cousin, neighbour, town, cat, and dog; whether any of these can upbraid you. But I may also neglect this reflex standard, and absolve me to myself. I have my own stern claims and perfect circle. It denies the name of duty to many offices that are called duties. But if I can discharge its debts, it enables me to dispense with the popular code. If any one imagines that this law is lax, let him keep its commandment one day. 

And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster. High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself, that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others! 

If any man consider the present aspects of what is called by distinction society, he will see the need of these ethics. The sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out, and we are become timorous, desponding whimperers. We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and perfect persons. We want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state, but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot satisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force, and do lean and beg day and night continually. Our housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, our occupations, our marriages, our religion, we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us. We are parlour soldiers. We shun the rugged battle of fate, where strength is born. 

If our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not `studying a profession,' for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, —and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history. 

It is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution in all the offices and relations of men; in their religion; in their education; in their pursuits; their modes of living; their association; in their property; in their speculative views. 

1. In what prayers do men allow themselves! That which they call a holy office is not so much as brave and manly. Prayer looks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue, and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural, and mediatorial and miraculous. Prayer that craves a particular commodity, —any thing less than all good, —is vicious. Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good. But prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft. It supposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not beg. He will then see prayer in all action. The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard throughout nature, though for cheap ends. Caratach, in Fletcher's Bonduca, when admonished to inquire the mind of the god Audate, replies,— 

&quot;His hidden meaning lies in our endeavours;&lt;br/&gt;
Our valors are our best gods.&quot; 

Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities, if you can thereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work, and already the evil begins to be repaired. Our sympathy is just as base. We come to them who weep foolishly, and sit down and cry for company, instead of imparting to them truth and health in rough electric shocks, putting them once more in communication with their own reason. The secret of fortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide: him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out to him and embraces him, because he did not need it. We solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate him, because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him. &quot;To the persevering mortal,&quot; said Zoroaster, &quot;the blessed Immortals are swift.&quot; 

As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect. They say with those foolish Israelites, `Let not God speak to us, lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us, and we will obey.' Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my brother, because he has shut his own temple doors, and recites fables merely of his brother's, or his brother's brother's God. Every new mind is a new classification. If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, a Locke, a Lavoisier, a Hutton, a Bentham, a Fourier, it imposes its classification on other men, and lo! a new system. In proportion to the depth of the thought, and so to the number of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the pupil, is his complacency. But chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches, which are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty, and man's relation to the Highest. Such is Calvinism, Quakerism, Swedenborgism. The pupil takes the same delight in subordinating every thing to the new terminology, as a girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby. It will happen for a time, that the pupil will find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master's mind. But in all unbalanced minds, the classification is idolized, passes for the end, and not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe; the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master built. They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to see, —how you can see; `It must be somehow that you stole the light from us.' They do not yet perceive, that light, unsystematic, indomitable, will break into any cabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile and call it their own. If they are honest and do well, presently their neat new pinfold will be too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot and vanish, and the immortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed, million-colored, will beam over the universe as on the first morning. 

2. It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Travelling, whose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all educated Americans. They who made England, Italy, or Greece venerable in the imagination did so by sticking fast where they were, like an axis of the earth. In manly hours, we feel that duty is our place. The soul is no traveller; the wise man stays at home, and when his necessities, his duties, on any occasion call him from his house, or into foreign lands, he is at home still, and shall make men sensible by the expression of his countenance, that he goes the missionary of wisdom and virtue, and visits cities and men like a sovereign, and not like an interloper or a valet. 

I have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe, for the purposes of art, of study, and benevolence, so that the man is first domesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding somewhat greater than he knows. He who travels to be amused, or to get somewhat which he does not carry, travels away from himself, and grows old even in youth among old things. In Thebes, in Palmyra, his will and mind have become old and dilapidated as they. He carries ruins to ruins. 

Travelling is a fool's paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go. 

3. But the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deeper unsoundness affecting the whole intellectual action. The intellect is vagabond, and our system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but the travelling of the mind? Our houses are built with foreign taste; our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments; our opinions, our tastes, our faculties, lean, and follow the Past and the Distant. The soul created the arts wherever they have flourished. It was in his own mind that the artist sought his model. It was an application of his own thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed. And why need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model? Beauty, convenience, grandeur of thought, and quaint expression are as near to us as to any, and if the American artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by him, considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day, the wants of the people, the habit and form of the government, he will create a house in which all these will find themselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be satisfied also. 

Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shakspeare will never be made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much. There is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses, or Dante, but different from all these. Not possibly will the soul all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat itself; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of one nature. Abide in the simple and noble regions of thy life, obey thy heart, and thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld again. 

4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so does our spirit of society. All men plume themselves on the improvement of society, and no man improves. 

Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other. It undergoes continual changes; it is barbarous, it is civilized, it is christianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this change is not amelioration. For every thing that is given, something is taken. Society acquires new arts, and loses old instincts. What a contrast between the well-clad, reading, writing, thinking American, with a watch, a pencil, and a bill of exchange in his pocket, and the naked New Zealander, whose property is a club, a spear, a mat, and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under! But compare the health of the two men, and you shall see that the white man has lost his aboriginal strength. If the traveller tell us truly, strike the savage with a broad axe, and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck the blow into soft pitch, and the same blow shall send the white to his grave. 

The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet. He is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle. He has a fine Geneva watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, and so being sure of the information when he wants it, the man in the street does not know a star in the sky. The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows as little; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind. His note-books impair his memory; his libraries overload his wit; the insurance-office increases the number of accidents; and it may be a question whether machinery does not encumber; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy, by a Christianity entrenched in establishments and forms, some vigor of wild virtue. For every Stoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian? 

There is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard of height or bulk. No greater men are now than ever were. A singular equality may be observed between the great men of the first and of the last ages; nor can all the science, art, religion, and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail to educate greater men than Plutarch's heroes, three or four and twenty centuries ago. Not in time is the race progressive. Phocion, Socrates, Anaxagoras, Diogenes, are great men, but they leave no class. He who is really of their class will not be called by their name, but will be his own man, and, in his turn, the founder of a sect. The arts and inventions of each period are only its costume, and do not invigorate men. The harm of the improved machinery may compensate its good. Hudson and Behring accomplished so much in their fishing-boats, as to astonish Parry and Franklin, whose equipment exhausted the resources of science and art. Galileo, with an opera-glass, discovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena than any one since. Columbus found the New World in an undecked boat. It is curious to see the periodical disuse and perishing of means and machinery, which were introduced with loud laudation a few years or centuries before. The great genius returns to essential man. We reckoned the improvements of the art of war among the triumphs of science, and yet Napoleon conquered Europe by the bivouac, which consisted of falling back on naked valor, and disencumbering it of all aids. The Emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army, says Las Casas, &quot;without abolishing our arms, magazines, commissaries, and carriages, until, in imitation of the Roman custom, the soldier should receive his supply of corn, grind it in his hand-mill, and bake his bread himself.&quot; 

Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is composed does not. The same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge. Its unity is only phenomenal. The persons who make up a nation to-day, next year die, and their experience with them. 

And so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments which protect it, is the want of self-reliance. Men have looked away from themselves and at things so long, that they have come to esteem the religious, learned, and civil institutions as guards of property, and they deprecate assaults on these, because they feel them to be assaults on property. They measure their esteem of each other by what each has, and not by what each is. But a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his property, out of new respect for his nature. Especially he hates what he has, if he see that it is accidental, —came to him by inheritance, or gift, or crime; then he feels that it is not having; it does not belong to him, has no root in him, and merely lies there, because no revolution or no robber takes it away. But that which a man is does always by necessity acquire, and what the man acquires is living property, which does not wait the beck of rulers, or mobs, or revolutions, or fire, or storm, or bankruptcies, but perpetually renews itself wherever the man breathes. &quot;Thy lot or portion of life,&quot; said the Caliph Ali, &quot;is seeking after thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it.&quot; Our dependence on these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for numbers. The political parties meet in numerous conventions; the greater the concourse, and with each new uproar of announcement, The delegation from Essex! The Democrats from New Hampshire! The Whigs of Maine! the young patriot feels himself stronger than before by a new thousand of eyes and arms. In like manner the reformers summon conventions, and vote and resolve in multitude. Not so, O friends! will the God deign to enter and inhabit you, but by a method precisely the reverse. It is only as a man puts off all foreign support, and stands alone, that I see him to be strong and to prevail. He is weaker by every recruit to his banner. Is not a man better than a town? Ask nothing of men, and in the endless mutation, thou only firm column must presently appear the upholder of all that surrounds thee. He who knows that power is inborn, that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so perceiving, throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly rights himself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs, works miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head. 

So use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble with her, and gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. But do thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect, the chancellors of God. In the Will work and acquire, and thou hast chained the wheel of Chance, and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her rotations. A political victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your sick, or the return of your absent friend, or some other favorable event, raises your spirits, and you think good days are preparing for you. Do not believe it. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles.

==Preface==
The four following essays were published eighteen months ago in the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, and were reprobated in a violent manner, as far as I could hear, by most of the readers they met with.

Not a whit the less, I believe them to be the best, that is to say, the truest, the rightest-worded, and most serviceable things I have ever written; and the last of them, having had especial pains spent on it, is probably the best I shall ever write.

'This,' the reader may reply, 'it might be, yet not therefore well written.' Which, in no mock humility, admitting, I yet satisfied with the work, though with nothing else that I have done; and purposing shortly to follow out the subjects opened in these papers, as I may find leisure, I wish the introductory statements to be within the reach of any one who may care to refer to them. So I republish the essays as they appeared. One word only is changed, correcting the estimate of a weight; and no word is added.

Although, however, I find nothing to modify in these papers, it is a matter of regret to me that the most startling of all statements in them, - that respecting the necessity of the organization of labour, with fixed wages, - should have found its way into the first essay; it being quite one of the least important, though by no means the least certain, of the positions to be defended. The real gist of these papers, their central meaning and aim, is to give, as I believe for the first time in plain English, - it has often been incidentally given in good Greek by Plato&lt;small&gt;[[w:Plato|1]]&lt;/small&gt; and Xenophon&lt;small&gt;[[w:Xenophon|2]]&lt;/small&gt;, and good Latin by Cicero&lt;small&gt;[[w:Cicero|3]]&lt;/small&gt; and Horace&lt;small&gt;[[w:Horace|4]]&lt;/small&gt;, - a logical definition of WEALTH: such definition being absolutely needed for a basis of economical science. The most reputed essay on that subject which has appeared in modern times, after opening with the statement that 'writers on political economy profess to teach, or to investigate,(1*) the nature of wealth,' thus follows up the declaration of its thesis - 'Every one has a notion, sufficiently correct for common purpose, of what is meant by wealth.' ... 'It is no part of the design of this treatise to aim at metaphysical nicety of definition.'

Metaphysicial nicety, we assuredly do not need; but physical nicety, and logical accuracy, with respect to a physical subject, we as assuredly do.

Suppose the subject of inquiry, instead of being House-law (Oikonomia), has been Star-law (Astronomia), and that, ignoring distinction between stars fixed and wandering, as here between wealth radiant and wealth reflective, the writer had begun thus: 'Every one has a notion, sufficiently correct for common purpose, of what is meant by stars. Metaphysical nicety in the definition of a star is not the object of this treatise'; - the essay so opened might yet have been far more true in its final statements, and a thousand fold more
serviceable to the navigator, than any treatise on wealth, which founds its conclusion on the popular conception of wealth, can ever become to the economist.

It was, therefore, the first object of these following papers to give an accurate and stable definition of wealth. Their second object was to show that the acquisition of wealth was finally possible only under certain moral conditions of society, of which quite the first was a belief in the existence, and even, for practical purpose, in the attainability of honesty.

Without venturing to pronounce - since on such matter human judgement is by no means conclusive - what is, or is not, the noblest of God's works, we may yet admit so much of Pope's&lt;small&gt;[[w:Alexander Pope|5]]&lt;/small&gt; assertion as that an honest man is among His best works presently visible, and, as things stand, a somewhat rare one; but not an incredible or miraculous work; still less an abnormal one. Honesty is not a disturbing force, which deranges the orbits of economy; but a consistent and commanding force, by obedience to which - and by no other obedience - those orbits can continue clear of chaos.

It is true, I have sometimes heard Pope condemned for the lowness, instead of the height, of his standard: - 'Honesty is indeed a respectable virtue; but how much higher may men attain! Shall nothing more be asked of us than that we be honest?'

For the present, good friends, nothing. It seems that in our aspirations to be more than that, we have to some extent lost sight of the propriety of being so much as that. What else we may have lost faith in, there shall be here no question; but assuredly we have lost faith in common honesty, and in the working power of it. And this faith, with the facts on which it may rest, it is quite our first business to recover and keep: not only believing, but even by experience assuring ourselves, that there are yet in the world men who can be restrained from fraud otherwise than by the fear of losing employment;(2*) nay, that it is even accurately in proportion to the number of such men in any State, that the said State does or can prolong its existence.

To these two points, then, the following essays are mainly directed. The subject of the organization of labour is only casually touched upon; because, if we once can get sufficient quantity of honesty in our captains, the
organization of labour is easy, and will develop itself without quarrel or difficulty; but if we cannot get honesty in our captains, the organization of labour is for evermore impossible.

The several conditions of its possibility I purpose to examine at length in the sequel. Yet, lest the reader should be alarmed by the hints thrown out during the following investigation of first principles, as if they were leading him into unexpectedly dangerous ground, I will, for his better assurance, state at once the worst of the political creed at which I wish him to arrive.

(1.) First, - that there should be training schools for youth established, at Government cost,(3*) and under Government discipline, over the whole country; that every child born in the country should, at the parent's whish, be permitted (and, in certain cases, be under penalty required) to pass through them; and that, in these schools, the child should (with other minor pieces of knowledge hereafter to be considered) imperatively be taught, with the best skill of teaching that the country could produce, the following three things: - (a) The laws of health, and the exercices anjoined by them; (b) Habits of gentleness and justice; and (c) The calling by which he is to live.

(2.) Secondly, - that, in connection with these training schools, there should be established, also entirely under Government regulation, manufactories and workshops for the production and sale of every necessary of life, and for the exercise of every useful art. And that, interfering no whit with private entreprise, nor setting any restraints or tax on private trade, but leaving both to do their best, and beat the Government if they could, - there should, at these Government manufactories and shops, be authoritatively good and examplary work done, and pure and true substance sold; so that a man could be sure, if he chose to pay the Government price, that he got for his money bread
that was bread, ale that was ale, and work that was work.

(3.) Thirdly, - that any man, or woman, or boy, or girl, out of employment, should be at once received at the nearest Government school, and set to such work as it appeared, on trial, they were fit for, at a fixed rate of wages determinable every year; - that, being found incapable of work through ignorance, they should be taught, or being found incapable of work through sickness, should be tended; but that being found objecting to work, they should be set, under compulsion of the strictest nature, to the more painful and degrading forms of necessary toil, especially to that in mines and other places of danger (such danger being, however, diminished to the utmost by careful regulation and discipline), and the due wages of such work be retained, cost of compulsion first abstracted - to be at the workman's command, so soon as he has
come to sounder mind respecting the laws of employment.

(4.) Lastly, - that for the old and destitute, comfort and home should be provided; which provision, when misfortune had been by the working of such a system sifted from guilt, would be honourable instead of disgraceful to the receiver. For (I repeat this passage out of my &quot;Political Economy of Art&quot;, to which the reader is referred for farther detail) 'a labourer serves his country with his spade, just as a man in the middle ranks of life serves it with sword, pen, or lancet. If the service be less, and, therefore, the wages during health less, then the reward when health is broken may be less, but not less honourable; and it ought to be quite as natural and straightforward a matter for a labourer to take his pension from his parish, because he has deserved well of his parish, as for a man in higher rank to take his pension from his
country, because he has deserved well of his country.'

To which statement, I will only add, for conclusion, respecting the discipline and pay of life and death, that, for both high and low, Livy's last words touching Valerius Publicola&lt;small&gt;[[w:Valerius|6]]&lt;/small&gt;, 'de publico est elatus,'(4*) ought not to be a dishonourable close of epitaph.

These things, then, I believe, and am about, as I find power, to explain and illustrate in their various bearings; following out also what belongs to them of collateral inquiry. Here I state them only in brief, to prevent the reader casting about in alarm for my ultimate meaning; yet requesting him, for the present, to remember, that in a science dealing with so subtle elements as those of human nature, it is only possible to answer for the final truth of principles, not for the direct success of plans: and that in the best of these last, what can be immediately accomplished is always questionable, and what can
be finally accomplished, inconceivable.

Denmark Hill, 10th May, 1862.

1. Which? for where investigation is necessary, teaching is impossible.

2. 'The effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman is not that of his corporation, but of his customers. It is the fear of losing their employment which restrains his frauds, and corrects his negligence.' (Wealth of Nations, Book I, chap. 10.)[http://www.bibliomania.com/2/1/65/112/7046/1/frameset.html] Note to Second Edition. - The only addition I will make to the words of this book shall be a very earnest request to any Christian reader to think within himself what an entirely damned state of soul any human creature must have got into, who could read with acceptance such a sentence as this; much more, write it; and to oppose to it, the first commercial words of Venice, discovered by me
in her first church:

'Around this temple, let the Merchant's law be just, his weights true, and his contracts guileless.'

If any of my present readers think that my language in this note is either intemperate, or unbecoming, I will beg them to read with attention the Eighteenth paragraph of &quot;Sesame and Lilies&quot;; and to be assured that I never, myself, now use, in writing, any word which is not, in my deliberate judgement,
the fittest for the occasion.

Venice, Sunday, 18th March, 1877.

3. It will probably be inquired by near-sighted persons, out of what funds such schools could be supported. The expedient modes of direct provision for them I will examine hereafter; indirectly, they would be far more than self-supporting. The economy in crime alone, (quite one of the most costly articles of luxury in the modern European market,) which such schools would induce, would suffice to support them ten times over. Their economy of labour
would be pure again, and that too large to be presently calculable.

4. P. Valerius, omnium consensu princeps belli pacisque artibus, anno post moritur; gloriâ ingenti, copiis, familiaribus adeo exiguis, ut funeri sumtus
deesset: de publico est elatus. Luxere matronae ut Brutum.' - Lib. ii. c. xvi.

==The Roots of Honour==
Among the delusions which at different periods have possessed themselves of the minds of large masses of the human race, perhaps the most curious -- certainly the least creditable -- is the modern soi-disant science of political economy, based on the idea that an advantageous code of social action may be determined irrespectively of the influence of social affection.

Of course, as in the instances of alchemy, astrology, witchcraft, and other such popular creeds, political economy, has a plausible idea at the root of it. &quot;The social affections,&quot; says the economist, &quot;are accidental and disturbing elements in human nature; but avarice and the desire of progress are constant elements. Let us eliminate the inconstants, and, considering the human being merely as a covetous machine, examine by what laws of labour, purchase, and sale, the greatest accumulative result in wealth is obtainable. Those laws once determined, it will be for each individual afterwards to introduce as much of the disturbing affectionate element as he chooses, and to determine for himself
the result on the new conditions supposed.&quot;

This would be a perfectly logical and successful method of analysis, if the accidentals afterwards to be introduced were of the same nature as the powers first examined. Supposing a body in motion to be influenced by constant and inconstant forces, it is usually the simplest way of examining its course to trace it first under the persistent conditions, and afterwards introduce the causes of variation. But the disturbing elements in the social problem are not of the same nature as the constant ones: they alter the essence of the creature under examination the moment they are added; they operate, not mathematically, but chemically, introducing conditions which render all our previous knowledge unavailable. We made learned experiments upon pure nitrogen, and have convinced ourselves that it is a very manageable gas: but, behold! the thing which we have practically to deal with is its chloride; and this, the moment we touch it on our established principles, sends us and or apparatus through the
ceiling.

Observe, I neither impugn nor doubt the conclusion of the science if its terms are accepted. I am simply uninterested in then, as I should be in those of a science of gymnastics which assumed that men had no skeletons. It might be shown, on that supposition, that it would be advantageous to roll the students up into pellets, flatten them into cakes, or stretch them into cables; and that when these results were effected, the re-insertion of the skeleton would be attended with various inconveniences to their constitution. The reasoning might be admirable, the conclusions true, and the science deficient only in applicability. Modern political economy stands on a precisely similar basis. Assuming, not that the human being has no skeleton, but that it is all skeleton, it founds an ossifiant theory of progress on this negation of a soul; and having shown the utmost that may be made of bones, and constructed a number of interesting geometrical figures with death's-head and humeri, successfully proves the inconvenience of the reappearance of a soul among these corpuscular structures. I do not deny the truth of this theory: I simply deny its applicability to the present
phase of the world.

This inapplicability has been curiously manifested during the embarrassment caused by the late strikes of our workmen. Here occurs one of the simplest cases, in a pertinent and positive form, of the first vital problem which political economy has to deal with (the relation between employer and employed); and, at a severe crisis, when lives in multitudes and wealth in masses are at stake, the political economists are helpless -- practically mute: no demonstrable solution of the difficulty can be given by them, such as may convince or calm the opposing parties. Obstinately the masters take one view of the matter. Obstinately the operatives another; and no political science can set them at
one.

It would be strange if it could, it being not by &quot;science&quot; of any kind that men were ever intended to be set at one. Disputant after disputant vainly strives to show that the interests of the masters are, or are not, antagonistic to those of the men: none of the pleaders ever seeming to remember that it does not absolutely or always follow that the persons must he antagonistic because their interests are. If there is only a crust of bread in the house, and mother and children are starving, their interests are not the same. If the mother eats it, the children want it; if the children eat it, the mother must go hungry to her work. Yet it does not necessarily follow that there will be &quot;antagonism&quot; between them, that they will fight for the crust, and that the mother, being strongest, will get it, and eat it. Neither, in any other case, whatever the relations of the persons may be, can it be assumed for certain that, because their interests are diverse, they must necessarily regard each other with hostility, and use
violence or cunning to obtain the advantage.

Even if this were so, and it were as just as it is convenient to consider men as actuated by no other moral influences than those which affect rats or swine, the logical conditions of the question are still indeterminable. It can never be shown generally either that the interests of master and labourer are alike, or that they are opposed; for, according to circumstances, they may be either. It is, indeed, always the interest of both that the work should be rightly done, and a just price obtained for it; but, in the division of profits, the gain of the one may or may not be the loss of the other. It is not the master's interest to pay wages so low as to leave the men sickly and depressed, nor the workman's interest to be paid high wages if the smallness of the master's profit hinders him from enlarging his business, or conducting it in a safe and liberal way. A stoker ought not to desire high pay if the company is too poor to
keep the engine-wheels in repair.

And the varieties of circumstances which influence these reciprocal interests are so endless, that all endeavour to deduce rules of action from balance of expediency is in vain. And it is meant to be in vain. For no human actions ever were intended by the maker of men to be guided by balances of expediency, but by balances of justice. He has therefore rendered all endeavours to determine expediency futile for evermore. No man ever knew, or can know, what will be the ultimate result to himself, or to others, of any given line of conduct. But every man may know, and most of us do know, what is a just and unjust act. And all of us may know also, that the consequences of justice will be ultimately the best possible, both to others and ourselves, though we can neither say what is best, or how it is likely to come to pass.

I have said balances of justice, meaning, in the term justice, to include affection, -- such affection as one man owes to another. All right relations between master and operative, and all their best interests, ultimately depend on these.

We shall find the best and simplest illustration of the relations of master and operative in the position of domestic servants.

We will suppose that the master of a household desires only to get as much work out of his servants as he can, at the rate of wages he gives. He never allows them to be idle; feeds them as poorly and lodges them as ill as they will endure, and in all things pushes his requirements to the exact point beyond which he cannot go without forcing the servant to leave him. In doing this, there is no violation on his part of what is commonly called &quot;justice.&quot; He agrees with the domestic for his whole time ad service, and takes them; -- the limits of hardship in treatment being fixed by the practice of other masters in his neighbourhood; that is to say, by the current rate of wages for domestic labour. If the servant can get a better place, he is free to take one, and the master can only tell what is the real
market value of his labour, by requiring as much as he will give.

This is the politico-economical view of the case, according to the doctors of that science; who assert that by this procedure the greatest average of work will be obtained from the servant, and therefore the greatest benefit to the community, and through
the community, by reversion, to the servant himself.

That, however, is not so. It would be so if the servant were an engine of which the motive power was steam, magnetism, gravitation, or any other agent of calculable force. But he being, on the contrary, an engine whose motive power is a Soul, the force of this very peculiar agent, as an unknown quantity, enters into all the political economist's equations, without his knowledge, and falsifies every one of their results. The largest quantity of work will not be done by this curious engine for pay, or under pressure, or by help of any kind of fuel which may be supplied by the caldron. It will be done only when the motive force, that is to say, the will or spirit of the creature, is brought to its greatest strength by its own proper fuel: namely,
by the affections.

It may indeed happen, and does happen often, that if the master is a man of sense ad energy, a large quantity of material work may be done under mechanical pressure, enforced by strong will and guided by wise method; also it may happen, and does happen often, that if the master is indolent and weak (however good-natured), a very small quantity of work, and that bad, may be produced by the servant's undirected strength, and contemptuous gratitude. But the universal law of the matter is that, assuming any given quantity of energy and sense in master and servant, the greatest material result obtainable by them will be, not through antagonism to each other, but through affection for each other; and that if the master, instead of endeavouring to get as much work as possible from the servant, seeks rather to render his appointed and necessary work beneficial to him, and to forward his interests in all just and wholesome ways, the real amount of work ultimately done, or of good rendered, by the
person so cared for, will indeed be the greatest possible.

Observe, I say, &quot;of good rendered,&quot; for a servant's work is not necessarily or always the best thing he can give his master. But good of all kinds, whether in material service, in protective watchfulness of his master's interest and credit, or in joyful readiness to seize unexpected and irregular occasions of help.

Nor is this one whit less generally true because indulgence will be frequently abused, and kindness met with ingratitude. For the servant who, gently treated, is ungrateful, treated ungently, will be revengeful; and the man who is dishonest to a liberal
master will be injurious to an unjust one.

In any case, and with any person, this unselfish treatment will produce the most effective return. Observe, I am here considering the affections wholly as a motive power; not at all as things in themselves desirable or noble, or in any other way abstractedly good. I look at them simply as an anomalous force, rendering every one of the ordinary political economist's calculations nugatory; while, even if he desired to introduce this new element into his estimates, he has no power of dealing with it; for the affections only become a true motive power when they ignore every other motive and condition of political economy. Treat the servant kindly, with the idea of turning his gratitude to account, and you will get, as you deserve, no gratitude, nor any value for your kindness; but treat him kindly without any economical purpose, and all economical purposes will be answered; in this, as in all other matters, whosoever will
save his life shall lose it, whoso loses it shall find it.(1*)

The next clearest and simplest example of relation between master and operative is that which exists between the commander of a regiment and his men.

Supposing the officer only desires to apply the rules of discipline so as, with least trouble to himself, to make the regiment most effective, he will not be able, by any rules or administration of rules, on this selfish principle, to develop the full strength of his subordinates. If a man of sense and firmness, he may, as in the former instance, produce a better result than would be obtained by the irregular kindness of a weak officer; but let the sense and firmness be the same in both cases, and assuredly the officer who has the most direct personal relations with his men, the most care for their interests, and the most value for their lives, will develop their effective strength, through their affection for his own person, and trust in his character, to a degree wholly unattainable by other means. This law applies still more stringently as the numbers concerned are larger: a charge may often be successful, though the men dislike their officers; a battle has rarely been won, unless they
loved their general.

Passing from these simple examples to the more complicated relations existing between a manufacturer and his workmen, we are met first by certain curious difficulties, resulting, apparently, from a harder and colder state of moral elements. It is easy to imagine an enthusiastic affection existing among soldiers for the colonel. Not so easy to imagine an enthusiastic affection among cotton-spinners for the proprietor of the mill. A body of men associated for purposes of robbery (as a Highland clan in ancient times) shall be animated by perfect affection, and every member of it be ready to lay down his life for the life of his chief. But a band of men associated for purposes of legal production and accumulation is usually animated, it appears, by no such emotions, and none of them are in any wise willing to give his life for the life of his chief. Not only are we met by this apparent anomaly, in moral matters, but by others connected with it, in administration of system. For a servant or a soldier is engaged at a definite rate of wages, for a definite period; but a workman at a rate of wages variable according to the demand for labour, and with the risk of being at any time thrown out of his situation by chances of trade. Now, as, under these contingencies, no action of the affections can take place, but only an explosive action of disaffections, two points offer
themselves for consideration in the matter.

The first -- How far the rate of wages may be so regulated as not to vary with the demand for labour.

The second -- How far it is possible that bodies of workmen may be engaged and maintained at such fixed rate of wages (whatever the state of trade may be), without enlarging or diminishing their number, so as to give them permanent interest in the establishment with which they are connected, like that of the domestic servants in an old family, or an esprit de corps, like that of the soldiers in a crack regiment.

The first question is, I say, how far it may be possible to fix the rate of wages, irrespectively of the demand for labour.

Perhaps one of the most curious facts in the history of human error is the denial by the common political economist of the possibility of thus regulating wages; while, for all the important, and much of the unimportant, labour, on the earth,
wages are already so regulated.

We do not sell our prime-ministership by Dutch auction; nor, on the decease of a bishop, whatever may be the general advantages of simony, do we (yet) offer his diocese to the clergyman who will take the episcopacy at the lowest contract. We (with exquisite sagacity of political economy!) do indeed sell commissions; but not openly, generalships: sick, we do not inquire for a physician who takes less than a guinea; litigious, we never think of reducing six-and-eight-pence to four-and-sixpence; caught in a shower, we do not canvass the cabmen, to find one who values his driving at less than sixpence
a mile.

It is true that in all these cases there is, and in every conceivable case there must be, ultimate reference to the presumed difficulty of the work, or number of candidates for the office. If it were thought that the labour necessary to make a good physician would be gone through by a sufficient number of students with the prospect of only half-guinea fees, public consent would soon withdraw the unnecessary half-guinea. In this ultimate sense, the price of labour is indeed always regulated by the demand for it; but, so far as the practical and immediate administration of the matter is regarded, the best labour always has been, and is, as all labour ought to be, paid by an
invariable standard.

&quot;What!&quot; the reader perhaps answers amazedly: &quot;pay good and
bad workmen alike?&quot;

Certainly. The difference between one prelate's sermons and his successor's -- or between one physician's opinion and another's -- is far greater, as respects the qualities of mind involved, and far more important in result to you personally, than the difference between good and bad laying of bricks (though that is greater than most people suppose). Yet you pay with equal fee, contentedly, the good and bad workmen upon your soul, and the good and bad workmen upon your body; much more may you pay, contentedly, with equal fees, the good and bad workmen upon your
house.

&quot;Nay, but I choose my physician and (?) my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work.&quot; By all means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward of the good workman, to be &quot;chosen.&quot; The natural and right system respecting all labour is, that it should be paid at a fixed rate, but the good workman employed, and the bad workman unemployed. The false, unnatural, and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half-price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by his competition to
work for an inadequate sum.

This equality of wages, then, being the first object toward which we have to discover the directest available road; the second is, as above stated, that of maintaining constant numbers of workmen in employment, whatever may be the accidental demand
for the article they produce.

I believe the sudden and extensive inequalities of demand, which necessarily arise in the mercantile operations of an active nation, constitute the only essential difficulty which has to be overcome in a just organization of labour. The subject opens into too many branches to admit of being investigated in a paper of this kind; but the following general facts bearing on it may be
noted.

The wages which enable any workman to live are necessarily higher, if his work is liable to intermission, than if it is assured and continuous; and however severe the struggle for work may become, the general law will always hold, that men must get more daily pay if, on the average, they can only calculate on work three days a week than they would require if they were sure of work six days a week. Supposing that a man cannot live on less than a shilling a day, his seven shillings he must get, either for three days' violent work, or six days' deliberate work. The tendency of all modern mercantile operations is to throw both wages and trade into the form of a lottery, and to make the workman's pay depend on intermittent exertion, and the
principal's profit on dexterously used chance.

In what partial degree, I repeat, this may be necessary in consequence of the activities of modern trade, I do not here investigate; contenting myself with the fact, that in its fatalest aspects it is assuredly unnecessary, and results merely from love of gambling on the part of the masters, and from ignorance and sensuality in the men. The masters cannot bear to let any opportunity of gain escape them, and frantically rush at every gap and breach in the walls of Fortune, raging to be rich, and affronting, with impatient covetousness, every risk of ruin, while the men prefer three days of violent labour, and three days of drunkenness, to six days of moderate work and wise rest. There is no way in which a principal, who really desires to help his workmen, may do it more effectually than by checking these disorderly habits both in himself and them; keeping his own business operations on a scale which will enable him to pursue them securely, not yielding to temptations of precarious gain; and, at the same time, leading his workmen into regular habits of labour and life, either by inducing them rather to take low wages in the form of a fixed salary, than high wages, subject to the chance of their being thrown out of work; or, if this be impossible, by discouraging the system of violent exertion for nominally high day wages, and leading the men to take lower pay
for more regular labour.

In effecting any radical changes of this kind, doubtless there would be great inconvenience and loss incurred by all the originators of movement. That which can be done with perfect convenience and without loss, is not always the thing that most needs to be done, or which we are most imperatively required to do.

I have already alluded to the difference hitherto existing between regiments of men associated for purposes of violence, and for purposes of manufacture; in that the former appear capable of self-sacrifice -- the latter, not; which singular fact is the real reason of the general lowness of estimate in which the profession of commerce is held, as compared with that of arms. Philosophically, it does not, at first sight, appear reasonable (many writers have endeavoured to prove it unreasonable) that a peaceable and rational person, whose trade is buying and selling, should be held in less honour than an unpeaceable and often irrational person, whose trade is slaying. Nevertheless, the consent of mankind has always, in spite of the philosophers,
given precedence to the soldier.

And this is right.

For the soldier's trade, verily and essentially, is not slaying, but being slain. This, without well knowing its own meaning, the world honours it for. A bravo's trade is slaying; but the world has never respected bravos more than merchants: the reason it honours the soldier is, because he holds his life at the service of the State. Reckless he may be -- fond of pleasure or of adventure-all kinds of bye-motives and mean impulses may have determined the choice of his profession, and may affect (to all appearance exclusively) his daily conduct in it; but our estimate of him is based on this ultimate fact -- of which we are well assured -- that put him in a fortress breach, with all the pleasures of the world behind him, and only death and his duty in front of him, he will keep his face to the front; and he knows that his choice may be put to him at any moment -- and has beforehand taken his part -- virtually takes such part
continually -- does, in reality, die daily.

Not less is the respect we pay to the lawyer and physician, founded ultimately on their self-sacrifice. Whatever the learning or acuteness of a great lawyer, our chief respect for him depends on our belief that, set in a judge's seat, he will strive to judge justly, come of it what may. Could we suppose that he would take bribes, and use his acuteness and legal knowledge to give plausibility to iniquitous decisions, no degree of intellect would win for him our respect. Nothing will win it, short of our tacit conviction, that in all important acts of his life justice is first with him; his own interest, second.

In the case of a physician, the ground of the honour we render him is clearer still. Whatever his science, we would shrink from him in horror if we found him regard his patients merely as subjects to experiment upon; much more, if we found that, receiving bribes from persons interested in their deaths, he was using his best skill to give poison in the mask of
medicine.

Finally, the principle holds with utmost clearness as it respects clergymen. No goodness of disposition will excuse want of science in a physician, or of shrewdness in an advocate; but a clergyman, even though his power of intellect be small, is respected on the presumed ground of his unselfishness and
serviceableness.

Now, there can be no question but that the tact, foresight, decision, and other mental powers, required for the successful management of a large mercantile concern, if not such as could be compared with those of a great lawyer, general, or divine, would at least match the general conditions of mind required in the subordinate officers of a ship, or of a regiment, or in the curate of a country parish. If, therefore, all the efficient members of the so-called liberal professions are still, somehow, in public estimate of honour, preferred before the head of a commercial firm, the reason must lie deeper than in the measurement of their several powers of mind.

And the essential reason for such preference will he found to lie in the fact that the merchant is presumed to act always selfishly. His work may be very necessary to the community, but the motive of it is understood to be wholly personal. The merchant's first object in all his dealings must be (the public believe) to get as much for himself, and leave as little to his neighbour (or customer) as possible. Enforcing this upon him, by political statute, as the necessary principle of his action; recommending it to him on all occasions, and themselves reciprocally adopting it, proclaiming vociferously, for law of the universe, that a buyer's function is to cheapen, and a seller's to cheat, -- the public, nevertheless, involuntarily condemn the man of commerce for his compliance with their own statement, and stamp him for ever as belonging to an inferior
grade of human personality.

This they will find, eventually, they must give up doing. They must not cease to condemn selfishness; but they will have to discover a kind of commerce which is not exclusively selfish. Or, rather, they will have to discover that there never was, or can be, any other kind of commerce; that this which they have called commerce was not commerce at all, but cozening; and that a true merchant differs as much from a merchant according to laws of modern political economy, as the hero of the Excursion from Autolycus. They will find that commerce is an occupation which gentlemen will every day see more need to engage in, rather than in the businesses of talking to men, or slaying them; that, in true commerce, as in true preaching, or true fighting, it is necessary to admit the idea of occasional voluntary loss; -- that sixpences have to be lost, as well as lives, under a sense of duty. That the market may have its martyrdoms as well as the
pulpit; and trade its heroisms as well as war.

May have -- in the final issue, must have-and only has not had yet, because men of heroic temper have always been misguided in their youth into other fields; not recognising what is in our days, perhaps, the most important of all fields; so that, while many a jealous person loses his life in trying to teach the form of a gospel, very few will lose a hundred pounds in showing the
practice of one.

The fact is, that people never have had clearly explained to them the true functions of a merchant with respect to other people. I should like the reader to be very clear about this.

Five great intellectual professions, relating to daily necessities of life, have hitherto existed -- three exist necessarily, in every civilised nation:

The Soldier's profession is to defend it.

The Pastor's to teach it.

The Physician's to keep it in health.

The lawyer's to enforce justice in it.

The Merchant's to provide for it.

And the duty of all these men is, on due occasion, to die for it.

&quot;On due occasion,&quot; namely: -

The Soldier, rather than leave his post in battle.

The Physician, rather than leave his post in plague.

The Pastor, rather than teach Falsehood.

The lawyer, rather than countenance Injustice.

The Merchant-what is his &quot;due occasion&quot; of death?

It is the main question for the merchant, as for all of us. For, truly, the man who does not know when to die, does not know how to live.

Observe, the merchant's function (or manufacturer's, for in the broad sense in which it is here used the word must be understood to include both) is to provide for the nation. It is no more his function to get profit for himself out of that provision than it is a clergyman's function to get his stipend. This stipend is a due and necessary adjunct, but not the object of his life, if he be a true clergyman, any more than his fee (or honorarium) is the object of life to a true physician. Neither is his fee the object of life to a true merchant. All three, if true men, have a work to be done irrespective of fee -- to be done even at any cost, or for quite the contrary of fee; the pastor's function being to teach, the physician's to heal, and the merchant's, as I have said, to provide. That is to say, he has to understand to their very root the qualities of the thing he deals in, and the means of obtaining or producing it; and he has to apply all his sagacity and energy to the producing or obtaining it in perfect state, and distributing it at the cheapest possible
price where it is most needed.

And because the production or obtaining of any commodity involves necessarily the agency of many lives and hands, the merchant becomes in the course of his business the master and governor of large masses of men in a more direct, though less confessed way, than a military officer or pastor; so that on him falls, in great part, the responsibility for the kind of life they lead: and it becomes his duty, not only to be always considering how to produce what he sells, in the purest and cheapest forms, but how to make the various employments involved in the production, or transference of it, most beneficial to the
men employed.

And as into these two functions, requiring for their right exercise the highest intelligence, as well as patience, kindness, and tact, the merchant is bound to put all his energy, so for their just discharge he is bound, as soldier or physician is bound, to give up, if need be, his life, in such way as it may be demanded of him. Two main points he has in his providing function to maintain: first, his engagements (faithfulness to engagements being the real root of all possibilities, in commerce); and, secondly, the perfectness and purity of the thing provided; so that, rather than fail in any engagement, or consent to any deterioration, adulteration, or unjust and exorbitant price of that which he provides, he is bound to meet fearlessly any form of distress, poverty, or labour, which may, through maintenance
of these points, come upon him.

Again: in his office as governor of the men employed by him, the merchant or manufacturer is invested with a distinctly paternal authority and responsibility. In most cases, a youth entering a commercial establishment is withdrawn altogether from home influence; his master must become his father, else he has, for practical and constant help, no father at hand: in all cases the master's authority, together with the general tone and atmosphere of his business, and the character of the men with whom the youth is compelled in the course of it to associate, have more immediate and pressing weight than the home influence, and will usually neutralize it either for good or evil; so that the only means which the master has of doing justice to the men employed by him is to ask himself sternly whether he is dealing with such subordinate as he would with his own son, if compelled
by circumstances to take such a position.

Supposing the captain of a frigate saw it right, or were by any chance obliged, to place his own son in the position of a common sailor: as he would then treat his son, he is bound always to treat every one of the men under him. So, also, supposing the master of a manufactory saw it right, or were by any chance obliged, to place his own son in the position of an ordinary workman; as he would then treat his son, he is bound always to treat every one of his men. This is the only effective, true, or practical Rule which can be given on this point of political
economy.

And as the captain of a ship is bound to be the last man to leave his ship in case of wreck, and to share his last crust with the sailors in case of famine, so the manufacturer, in any commercial crisis or distress, is bound to take the suffering of it with his men, and even to take more of it for himself than he allows his men to feel; as a father would in a famine, shipwreck,
or battle, sacrifice himself for his son.

All which sounds very strange: the only real strangeness in the matter being, nevertheless, that it should so sound. For all this is true, and that not partially nor theoretically, but everlastingly and practically: all other doctrine than this respecting matters political being false in premises, absurd in deduction, and impossible in practice, consistently with any progressive state of national life; all the life which we now possess as a nation showing itself in the resolute denial and scorn, by a few strong minds and faithful hearts, of the economic principles taught to our multitudes, which principles, so far as accepted, lead straight to national destruction. Respecting the modes and forms of destruction to which they lead, and, on the other hand, respecting the farther practical working of true
polity, I hope to reason farther in a following paper.

==The Veins of Wealth==
The answer which would be made by any ordinary political economist to the statements contained in the preceding paper, is in few words as follows:

&quot;It is indeed true that certain advantages of a general nature may be obtained by the development of social affections. But political economists never professed, nor profess, to take advantages of a general nature into consideration. Our science is simply the science of getting rich. So far from being a fallacious or visionary one, it is found by experience to be practically effective. Persons who follow its precepts do actually become rich, and persons who disobey them become poor. Every capitalist of Europe has acquired his fortune by following the known laws of our science, and increases his capital daily by an adherence to them. It is vain to bring forward tricks of logic, against the force of accomplished facts. Every man of business knows by experience how money is made, and how it is lost.&quot;

Pardon me. Men of business do indeed know how they themselves made their money, or how, on occasion, they lost it. Playing a long-practised game, they are familiar with the chances of its cards, and can rightly explain their losses and gains. But they neither know who keeps the bank of the gambling-house, nor what other games may be played with the same cards, nor what other losses and gains, far away among the dark streets, are essentially, though invisibly, dependent on theirs in the lighted rooms. They have learned a few, and only a few, of the laws of mercantile economy; but not one of those of political economy.

Primarily, which is very notable and curious, I observe that men of business rarely know the meaning of the word &quot;rich.&quot; At least, if they know, they do not in their reasonings allow for the fact, that it is a relative word, implying its opposite &quot;poor&quot; as positively as the word &quot;north&quot; implies its opposite &quot;south.&quot; Men nearly always speak and write as if riches were absolute, and it were possible, by following certain scientific precepts, for everybody to be rich. Whereas riches are a power like that of electricity, acting only through inequalities or negations of itself. The force of the guinea you have in your pocket depends wholly on the default of a guinea in your neighbour's pocket. If he did not want it, it would be of no use to you; the degree of power it possesses depends accurately upon the need or desire he has for it, -- and the art of making yourself rich, in the ordinary mercantile economist's sense, is therefore equally and necessarily the art of keeping your
neighbour poor.

I would not contend in this matter (and rarely in any matter) for the acceptance of terms. But I wish the reader clearly and deeply to understand the difference between the two economies, to which the terms &quot;Political&quot; and &quot;Mercantile&quot; might not unadvisedly be attached.

Political economy (the economy of a State, or of citizens) consists simply in the production, preservation, and distribution, at fittest time and place, of useful or pleasurable things. The farmer who cuts his hay at the right time; the shipwright who drives his bolts well home in sound wood; the builder who lays good bricks in well-tempered mortar; the housewife who takes care of her furniture in the parlour, and guards against all waste in her kitchen; and the singer who rightly disciplines, and never overstrains her voice, are all political economists in the true and final sense: adding continually to the riches and well-being of the nation to which
they belong.

But mercantile economy, the economy of &quot;merces&quot; or of &quot;pay,&quot; signifies the accumulation, in the hands of individuals, of legal or moral claim upon, or power over, the labour of others; every such claim implying precisely as much poverty or debt on one
side, as it implies riches or right on the other.

It does not, therefore, necessarily involve an addition to the actual property, or well-being, of the State in which it exists. But since this commercial wealth, or power over labour, is nearly always convertible at once into real property, while real property is not always convertible at once into power over labour, the idea of riches among active men in civilized nations, generally refers to commercial wealth; and in estimating their possessions, they rather calculate the value of their horses and fields by the number of guineas they could get for them, than the value of their guineas by the number of horses and fields they
could buy with them.

There is, however, another reason for this habit of mind; namely, that an accumulation of real property is of little use to its owner, unless, together with it, he has commercial power over labour. Thus, suppose any person to be put in possession of a large estate of fruitful land, with rich beds of gold in its gravel, countless herds of cattle in its pastures; houses, and gardens, and storehouses full of useful stores; but suppose, after all, that he could get no servants? In order that he may be able to have servants, some one in his neighbourhood must be poor, and in want of his gold -- or his corn. Assume that no one is in want of either, and that no servants are to be had. He must, therefore, bake his own bread, make his own clothes, plough his own ground, and shepherd his own flocks. His gold will be as useful to him as any other yellow pebbles on his estate. His stores must rot, for he cannot consume them. He can eat no more than another man could eat, and wear no more than another man could wear. He must lead a life of severe and common labour to procure even ordinary comforts; he will be ultimately unable to keep either houses in repair, or fields in cultivation; and forced to content himself with a poor man's portion of cottage and garden, in the midst of a desert of waste land, trampled by wild cattle, and encumbered by ruins of palaces, which he will
hardly mock at himself by calling &quot;his own.&quot;

The most covetous of mankind would, with small exultation, I presume, accept riches of this kind on these terms. What is really desired, under the name of riches, is essentially, power over men; in its simplest sense, the power of obtaining for our own advantage the labour of servant, tradesman, and artist; in wider sense, authority of directing large masses of the nation to various ends (good, trivial or hurtful, according to the mind of the rich person). And this power of wealth of course is greater or less in direct proportion to the poverty of the men over whom it is exercised, and in inverse proportion to the number of persons who are as rich as ourselves, and who are ready to give the same price for an article of which the supply is limited. If the musician is poor, he will sing for small pay, as long as there is only one person who can pay him; but if there be two or three, he will sing for the one who offers him most. And thus the power of the riches of the patron (always imperfect and doubtful, as we shall see presently, even when most authoritative) depends first on the poverty of the artist, and then on the limitation of the number of equally wealthy persons, who also want seats at the concert. So that, as above stated, the art of becoming &quot;rich,&quot; in the common sense, is not absolutely nor finally the art of accumulating much money for ourselves, but also of contriving that our neighbours shall have less. In accurate terms, it is &quot;the art of establishing the maximum inequality in our own
favour.&quot;

Now, the establishment of such inequality cannot be shown in the abstract to be either advantageous or disadvantageous to the body of the nation. The rash and absurd assumption that such inequalities are necessarily advantageous, lies at the root of most of the popular fallacies on the subject of political economy. For the eternal and inevitable law in this matter is, that the beneficialness of the inequality depends, first, on the methods by which it was accomplished; and, secondly, on the purposes to which it is applied. Inequalities of wealth, unjustly established, have assuredly injured the nation in which they exist during their establishment; and, unjustly directed, injure it yet more during their existence. But inequalities of wealth, justly established, benefit the nation in the course of their establishment; and, nobly used, aid it yet more by their existence. That is to say, among every active and well-governed people, the various strength of individuals, tested by full exertion and specially applied to various need, issues in unequal, but harmonious results, receiving reward or authority according to its class and service;(2*) while, in the inactive or ill-governed nation, the gradations of decay and the victories of treason work out also their own rugged system of subjection and success; and substitute, for the melodious inequalities of concurrent power, the iniquitous dominances and depressions of
guilt and misfortune.

Thus the circulation of wealth in a nation resembles that of the blood in the natural body. There is one quickness of the current which comes of cheerful emotion or wholesome exercise; and another which comes of shame or of fever. There is a flush of the body which is full of warmth and life; and another which will
pass into putrefaction.

The analogy will hold down even to minute particulars. For as diseased local determination of the blood involves depression of the general health of the system, all morbid local action of riches will be found ultimately to involve a weakening of the resources of the body politic.

The mode in which this is produced may be at once understood by examining one or two instances of the development of wealth in the simplest possible circumstances.

Suppose two sailors cast away on an uninhabited coast, and obliged to maintain themselves there by their own labour for a series of years.

If they both kept their health, and worked steadily and in amity with each other, they might build themselves a convenient house, and in time come to possess a certain quantity of cultivated land, together with various stores laid up for future use. All these things would be real riches or property; and, supposing the men both to have worked equally hard, they would each have right to equal share or use of it. Their political economy would consist merely in careful preservation and just division of these possessions. Perhaps, however, after some time one or other might be dissatisfied with the results of their common farming; and they might in consequence agree to divide the land they had brought under the spade into equal shares, so that each might thenceforward work in his own field, and live by it. Suppose that after this arrangement had been made, one of them were to fall ill, and be unable to work on his land at a critical
time -- say of sowing or harvest.

He would naturally ask the other to sow or reap for him.

Then his companion might say, with perfect justice, &quot;I will do this additional work for you; but if I do it, you must promise to do as much for me at another time. I will count how many hours I spend on your ground, and you shall give me a written promise to work for the same number of hours on mine, whenever I need your help, and you are able to give it.&quot; Suppose the disabled man's sickness to continue, and that under various circumstances, for several years, requiring the help of the other, he on each occasion gave a written pledge to work, as soon as he was able, at his companion's orders, for the same number of hours which the other had given up to him. What will the positions of the two men
be when the invalid is able to resume work?

Considered as a &quot;Polis,&quot; or state, they will be poorer than they would have been otherwise: poorer by the withdrawal of what the sick man's labour would have produced in the interval. His friend may perhaps have toiled with an energy quickened by the enlarged need, but in the end his own land and property must have suffered by the withdrawal of so much of his time and thought from them: and the united property of the two men will be certainly less than it would have been if both had remained in
health and activity.

But the relations in which they stand to each other are also widely altered. The sick man has not only pledged his labour for some years, but will probably have exhausted his own share of the accumulated stores, and will be in consequence for some time dependent on the other for food, which he can only &quot;pay&quot; or reward him for by yet more deeply pledging his own labour.

Supposing the written promises to be held entirely valid (among civilized nations their validity is secured by legal measures(3*)), the person who had hitherto worked for both might now, if he chose, rest altogether, and pass his time in idleness, not only forcing his companion to redeem all the engagements he had already entered into, but exacting from him pledges for further labour, to an arbitrary amount, for what food he had to
advance to him.

There might not, from first to last, be the least illegality (in the ordinary sense of the word) in the arrangement; but if a stranger arrived on the coast at this advanced epoch of their political economy, he would find one man commercially Rich; the other commercially Poor. He would see, perhaps, with no small surprise, one passing his days in idleness; the other labouring for both, and living sparely, in the hope of recovering his
independence at some distant period.

This is, of course, an example of one only out of many ways in which inequality of possession may be established between different persons, giving rise to the Mercantile forms of Riches and Poverty. In the instance before us, one of the men might from the first have deliberately chosen to be idle, and to put his life in pawn for present ease; or he might have mismanaged his land, and been compelled to have recourse to his neighbour for food and help, pledging his future labour for it. But what I want the reader to note especially is the fact, common to a large number of typical cases of this kind, that the establishment of the mercantile wealth which consists in a claim upon labour, signifies a political diminution of the real wealth which
consists in substantial possessions.

Take another example, more consistent with the ordinary course of affairs of trade. Suppose that three men, instead of two, formed the little isolated republic, and found themselves obliged to separate, in order to farm different pieces of land at some distance from each other along the coast: each estate furnishing a distinct kind of produce, and each more or less in need of the material raised on the other. Suppose that the third man, in order to save the time of all three, undertakes simply to superintend the transference of commodities from one farm to the other; on condition of receiving some sufficiently remunerative share of every parcel of goods conveyed, or of some other parcel
received in exchange for it.

If this carrier or messenger always brings to each estate, from the other, what is chiefly wanted, at the right time, the operations of the two farmers will go on prosperously, and the largest possible result in produce, or wealth, will be attained by the little community. But suppose no intercourse between the landowners is possible, except through the travelling agent; and that, after a time, this agent, watching the course of each man's agriculture, keeps back the articles with which he has been entrusted until there comes a period of extreme necessity for them, on one side or other, and then exacts in exchange for them all that the distressed farmer can spare of other kinds of produce: it is easy to see that by ingeniously watching his opportunities, he might possess himself regularly of the greater part of the superfluous produce of the two estates, and at last, in some year of severest trial or scarcity, purchase both for himself and maintain the former proprietors thenceforward as his
labourers or servants.

This would be a case of commercial wealth acquired on the exactest principles of modern political economy. But more distinctly even than in the former instance, it is manifest in this that the wealth of the State, or of the three men considered as a society, is collectively less than it would have been had the merchant been content with juster profit. The operations of the two agriculturists have been cramped to the utmost; and the continual limitations of the supply of things they wanted at critical times, together with the failure of courage consequent on the prolongation of a struggle for mere existence, without any sense of permanent gain, must have seriously diminished the effective results of their labour; and the stores finally accumulated in the merchant's hands will not in any wise be of equivalent value to those which, had his dealings been honest, would have filled at once the granaries of the farmers and his
own.

The whole question, therefore, respecting not only the advantage, but even the quantity, of national wealth, resolves itself finally into one of abstract justice. It is impossible to conclude, of any given mass of acquired wealth, merely by the fact of its existence, whether it signifies good or evil to the nation in the midst of which it exists. Its real value depends on the moral sign attached to it, just as sternly as that of a mathematical quantity depends on the algebraical sign attached to it. Any given accumulation of commercial wealth may be indicative, on the one hand, of faithful industries, progressive energies, and productive ingenuities: or, on the other, it may be indicative of mortal luxury, merciless tyranny, ruinous chicane. Some treasures are heavy with human tears, as an ill-stored harvest with untimely rain; and some gold is brighter in sunshine
than it is in substance.

And these are not, observe, merely moral or pathetic attributes of riches, which the seeker of riches may, if he chooses, despise; they are, literally and sternly, material attributes of riches, depreciating or exalting, incalculably, the monetary signification of the sum in question. One mass of money is the outcome of action which has created, another, of action which has annihilated, -- ten times as much in the gathering of it; such and such strong hands have been paralyzed, as if they had been numbed by nightshade: so many strong men's courage broken, so many productive operations hindered; this and the other false direction given to labour, and lying image of prosperity set up, on Dura plains dug into seven-times-heated furnaces. That which seems to be wealth may in verity be only the gilded index of far-reaching ruin: a wrecker's handful of coin gleaned from the beach to which he has beguiled an argosy; a camp-follower's bundle of rags unwrapped from the breasts of goodly soldiers dead; the purchase-pieces of potter's fields,
wherein shall be buried together the citizen and the stranger.

And therefore, the idea that directions can be given for the gaining of wealth, irrespectively of the consideration of its moral sources, or that any general and technical law of purchase and gain can be set down for national practice, is perhaps the most insolently futile of all that ever beguiled men through their vices. So far as I know, there is not in history record of anything so disgraceful to the human intellect as the modern idea that the commercial text, &quot;Buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest,&quot; represents, or under any circumstances could represent, an available principle of national economy. Buy in the cheapest market? yes; but what made your market cheap? Charcoal may be cheap among your roof timbers after a fire, and bricks may be cheap in your streets after an earthquake; but fire and earthquake may not therefore he national benefits. Sell in the dearest? -- Yes, truly; but what made your market dear? You sold your bread well to-day: was it to a dying man who gave his last coin for it, and will never need bread more; or to a rich man who to-morrow will buy your farm over your head; or to a soldier on
his way to pillage the bank in which you have put your fortune?

None of these things you can know. One thing only you can know: namely, whether this dealing of yours is a just and faithful one, which is all you need concern yourself about respecting it; sure thus to have done your own part in bringing about ultimately in the world a state of things which will not issue in pillage or in death. And thus every question concerning these things merges itself ultimately in the great question of justice, which, the ground being thus far cleared for it. I will enter upon the next paper, leaving only, in this, three final
points for the reader's consideration.

It has been shown that the chief value and virtue of money consists in its having power over human beings; that, without this power, large material possessions are useless, and to any person possessing such power, comparatively unnecessary. But power over human beings is attainable by other means than by money. As I said a few pages back, the money power is always imperfect and doubtful; there are many things which cannot be reached with it, others which cannot be retained by it. Many joys may be given to men which cannot be bought for gold, and many
fidelities found in them which cannot be rewarded with it.

Trite enough, -- the reader thinks. Yes: but it is not so trite, -- I wish it were, -- that in this moral power, quite inscrutable and immeasurable though it be, there is a monetary value just as real as that represented by more ponderous currencies. A man's hand may be full of invisible gold, and the wave of it, or the grasp, shall do more than another's with a shower of bullion. This invisible gold, also, does not necessarily diminish in spending. Political economists will do well some day to take heed of it, though they cannot take
measure.

But farther. Since the essence of wealth consists in its authority over men, if the apparent or nominal wealth fail in this power, it fails in essence; in fact, ceases to be wealth at all. It does not appear lately in England, that our authority over men is absolute. The servants show some disposition to rush riotously upstairs, under an impression that their wages are not regularly paid. We should augur ill of any gentleman's property
to whom this happened every other day in his drawing-room.

So, also, the power of our wealth seems limited as respects the comfort of the servants, no less than their quietude. The persons in the kitchen appear to be ill-dressed, squalid, half-starved. One cannot help imagining that the riches of the establishment must be of a very theoretical and documentary character.

Finally. Since the essence of wealth consists in power over men, will it not follow that the nobler and the more in number the persons are over whom it has power, the greater the wealth? Perhaps it may even appear, after some consideration, that the persons themselves are the wealth that these pieces of gold with which we are in the habit of guiding them, are, in fact, nothing more than a kind of Byzantine harness or trappings, very glittering and beautiful in barbaric sight, wherewith we bridle the creatures; but that if these same living creatures could be guided without the fretting and jingling of the Byzants in their mouths and ears, they might themselves be more valuable than their bridles. In fact, it may be discovered that the true veins of wealth are purple -- and not in Rock, but in Flesh -- perhaps even that the final outcome and consummation of all wealth is in the producing as many as possible full-breathed, bright-eyed, and happy-hearted human creatures. Our modern wealth, I think, has rather a tendency the other way; -- most political economists appearing to consider multitudes of human creatures not conducive to wealth, or at best conducive to it only by remaining in a
dim-eyed and narrow-chested state of being.

Nevertheless, it is open, I repeat, to serious question, which I leave to the reader's pondering, whether, among national manufactures, that of Souls of a good quality may not at last turn out a quite leadingly lucrative one? Nay, in some far-away and yet undreamt-of hour, I can even imagine that England may cast all thoughts of possessive wealth back to the barbaric nations among whom they first arose; and that, while the sands of the Indus and adamant of Golconda may yet stiffen the housings of the charger, and flash from the turban of the slave, she, as a Christian mother, may at last attain to the virtues and the treasures of a Heathen one, and be able to lead forth her Sons,
saying, --

         &quot;These are My Jewels.&quot;

==Qui Judicatis Terram==
Some centuries before the Christian era, a Jew merchant largely engaged in business on the Gold Coast, and reported to have made one of the largest fortunes of his time, (held also in repute for much practical sagacity,) left among his ledgers some general maxims concerning wealth, which have been preserved, strangely enough, even to our own days. They were held in considerable respect by the most active traders of the middle ages, especially by the Venetians, who even went so far in their admiration as to place a statue of the old Jew on the angle of one of their principal public buildings. Of late years these writings have fallen into disrepute, being opposed in every particular to the spirit of modern commerce. Nevertheless I shall reproduce a passage or two from them here, partly because they may interest the reader by their novelty; and chiefly because they will show him that it is possible for a very practical and acquisitive tradesman to hold, through a not unsuccessful career, that principle of distinction between well-gotten and ill-gotten wealth, which, partially insisted on in my last paper, it must be
our work more completely to examine in this.

He says, for instance, in one place: &quot;The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that see death: &quot;adding in another, with the same meaning (he has a curious way of doubling his sayings): &quot;Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but justice delivers from death.&quot; Both these passages are notable for their assertion of death as the only real issue and sum of attainment by any unjust scheme of wealth. If we read, instead of &quot;lying tongue,&quot; &quot;lying label, title, pretence, or advertisement,&quot; we shall more clearly perceive the bearing of the words on modern business. The seeking of death is a grand expression of the true course of men's toil in such business. We usually speak as if death pursued us, and we fled from him; but that is only so in rare instances. Ordinarily he masks himself -- makes himself beautiful -- all-glorious; not like the King's daughter, all-glorious within, but outwardly: his clothing of wrought gold. We pursue him frantically all our days, he flying or hiding from us. Our crowning success at three-score and ten is utterly and perfectly to seize, and hold him in his
eternal integrity -- robes, ashes, and sting.

Again: the merchant says, &quot;He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, shall surely come to want.&quot; And again, more strongly: &quot;Rob not the poor because he is poor; neither oppress the afflicted in the place of business. For God shall spoil the
soul of those that spoiled them.&quot;

This &quot;robbing the poor because he is poor,&quot; is especially the mercantile form of theft, consisting in talking advantage of a man's necessities in order to obtain his labour or property at a reduced price. The ordinary highwayman's opposite form of robbery -- of the rich, because he is rich -- does not appear to occur so often to the old merchant's mind; probably because, being less profitable and more dangerous than the robbery of the poor, it is
rarely practised by persons of discretion. 

But the two most remarkable passages in their deep general significance are the following: --

&quot;The rich and the poor have met. God is their maker.&quot;

They &quot;have met:&quot; more literally, have stood in each other's way (obviaverunt). That is to say, as long as the world lasts, the action and counteraction of wealth and poverty, the meeting, face to face, of rich and poor, is just as appointed and necessary a law of that world as the flow of stream to sea, or the interchange of power among the electric clouds: -- &quot;God is their maker.&quot; But, also, this action may be either gentle and just, or convulsive and destructive: it may be by rage of devouring flood, or by lapse of serviceable wave; -- in blackness of thunderstroke, or continual force of vital fire, soft, and shapeable into love-syllables from far away. And which of these it shall be depends on both rich and poor knowing that God is their light; that in the mystery of human life, there is no other light than this by which they can see each other's faces, and live; -- light, which is called in another of the books among which the merchant's maxims have been preserved, the &quot;sun of justice,&quot;(4*) of which it is promised that it shall rise at last with &quot;healing&quot; (health-giving or helping, making whole or setting at one) in its wings. For truly this healing is only possible by means of justice; no love, no faith, no hope will do it; men will be unwisely fond-vainly faithful, unless primarily they are just; and the mistake of the best men through generation after generation, has been that great one of thinking to help the poor by almsgiving, and by preaching of patience or of hope, and by every other means, emollient or consolatory, except the one thing which God orders for them, justice. But this justice, with its accompanying holiness or helpfulness, being even by the best men denied in its trial time, is by the mass of men hated wherever it appears: so that, when the choice was one day fairly put to them, they denied the Helpful One and the Just;(5*) and desired a murderer, sedition-raiser, and robber, to be gran ted to them; --the murderer instead of the Lord of Life, the sedition-raiser instead of the Prince of Peace, and the robber instead of the
Just Judge of all the world.

I have just spoken of the flowing of streams to the sea as a partial image of the action of wealth. In one respect it is not a partial, but a perfect image. The popular economist thinks himself wise in having discovered that wealth, or the forms of property in general, must go where they are required; that where demand is, supply must follow. He farther declares that this course of demand and supply cannot be forbidden by human laws. Precisely in the same sense, and with the same certainty, the waters of the world go where they are required. Where the land falls, the water flows. The course neither of clouds nor rivers can be forbidden by human will. But the disposition and administration of them can be altered by human forethought. Whether the stream shall be a curse or a blessing, depends upon man's labour, and administrating intelligence. For centuries after centuries, great districts of the world, rich in soil, and favoured in climate, have lain desert under the rage of their own rivers; nor only desert, but plague-struck. The stream which, rightly directed, would have flowed in soft irrigation from field to field -- would have purified the air, given food to man and beast, and carried their burdens for them on its bosom -- now overwhelms the plain, and poisons the wind; its breath pestilence, and its work famine. In like manner this wealth &quot;goes where it is required.&quot; No human laws can withstand its flow. They can only guide it: but this, the lending trench and limiting mound can do so thoroughly, that it shall become water of life --the riches of the hand of wisdom;(6*) or, on the contrary, by leaving it to its own lawless flow, they may make it, what it has been too often, the last and deadliest of national plagues: water
of Marah -- the water which feeds the roots of all evil.

The necessity of these laws of distribution or restraint is curiously over-looked in the ordinary political economist's definition of his own &quot;science.&quot; He calls it, shortly, the &quot;science of getting rich.&quot; But there are many sciences, as well as many arts, of getting rich. Poisoning people of large estates, was one employed largely in the middle ages; adulteration of food of people of small estates, is one employed largely now. The ancient and honourable Highland method of blackmail; the more modern and less honourable system of obtaining goods on credit, and the other variously improved methods of appropriation --which, in major and minor scales of industry, down to the most artistic pocket-picking, we owe to recent genius, -- all come
under the general head of sciences, or arts, of getting rich.

So that it is clear the popular economist, in calling his science the science par excellence of getting rich, must attach some peculiar ideas of limitation to its character. I hope I do not misrepresent him, by assuming that he means his science to be the science of &quot;getting rich by legal or just means.&quot; In this definition, is the word &quot;just,&quot; or &quot;legal,&quot; finally to stand? For it is possible among certain nations, or under certain rulers, or by help of certain advocates, that proceedings may be legal which are by no means just. If, therefore, we leave at last only the word &quot;just&quot; in that place of our definition, the insertion of this solitary and small word will make a notable difference in the grammar of our science. For then it will follow that, in order to grow rich scientifically, we must grow rich justly; and, therefore, know what is just; so that our economy will no longer depend merely on prudence, but on jurisprudence -- and that of divine, not human law. Which prudence is indeed of no mean order, holding itself, as it were, high in the air of heaven, and gazing for ever on the light of the sun of justice; hence the souls which have excelled in it are represented by Dante as stars, forming in heaven for ever the figure of the eye of an eagle: they having been in life the discerners of light from darkness; or to the whole human race, as the light of the body, which is the eye; while those souls which form the wings of the bird (giving power and dominion to justice, &quot;healing in its wings&quot;) trace also in light the inscription in heaven: &quot;DILIGITE JUSTITIAM QUI JUDICATIS TERRAM.&quot; &quot;Ye who judge the earth, give&quot; (not, observe, merely love, but) &quot;diligent love to justice:&quot; the love which seeks diligently, that is to say, choosingly, and by preference, to all things else. Which judging or doing judgment in the earth is, according to their capacity and position, required not of judges only, nor of rulers only, but of all men:(7*) a truth sorrowfully lost sight of even by those who are ready enough to apply to themselves passages in which Christian men are spoken of as called to be &quot;saints&quot; (i.e. to helpful or healing functions); and &quot;chosen to be kings&quot; (i.e. to knowing or directing functions); the true meaning of these titles having been long lost through the pretences of unhelpful and unable persons to saintly and kingly character; also through the once popular idea that both the sanctity and royalty are to consist in wearing long robes and high crowns, instead of in mercy and judgment; whereas all true sanctity is saving power, as all true royalty is ruling power; and injustice is part and parcel of the denial of such power, which &quot;makes men as the creeping things, as
the fishes of the sea, that have no ruler over them.&quot;(8*)

Absolute justice is indeed no more attainable than absolute truth; but the righteous man is distinguished from the unrighteous by his desire and hope of justice, as the true man from the false by his desire and hope of truth. And though absolute justice be unattainable, as much justice as we need for all practical use is attainable by all those who make it their
aim.

We have to examine, then, in the subject before us, what are the laws of justice respecting payment of labour -- no small part, these, of the foundations of all jurisprudence.

I reduced, in my last paper, the idea of money payment to its simplest or radical terms. In those terms its nature, and the conditions of justice respecting it, can be best ascertained.

Money payment, as there stated, consists radically in a promise to some person working for us, that for the time and labour he spends in our service to-day we will give or procure equivalent time and labour in his service at any future time when he may demand it.(9*)

If we promise to give him less labour than he has given us, we under-pay him. If we promise to give him more labour than he has given us, we over-pay him. In practice, according to the laws of demand and supply, when two men are ready to do the work, and only one man wants to have it done, the two men underbid each other for it; and the one who gets it to do, is under-paid. But when two men want the work done, and there is only one man ready to do it, the two men who want it done over-bid each other, and
the workman is over-paid.

I will examine these two points of injustice in succession; but first I wish the reader to clearly understand the central
principle, lying between the two, of right or just payment.

When we ask a service of any man, he may either give it us freely, or demand payment for it. Respecting free gift of service, there is no question at present, that being a matter of affection -- not of traffic. But if he demand payment for it, and we wish to treat him with absolute equity, it is evident that this equity can only consist in giving time for time, strength for strength, and skill for skill. If a man works an hour for us, and we only promise to work half-an-hour for him in return, we obtain an unjust advantage. If, on the contrary, we promise to work an hour and a half for him in return, he has an unjust advantage. The justice consists in absolute exchange; or, if there be any respect to the stations of the parties, it will not be in favour of the employer: there is certainly no equitable reason in a main's being poor, that if he give me a pound of bread to-day, I should return him less than a pound of bread to-morrow; or any equitable reason in a man's being uneducated, that if he uses a certain quantity of skill and knowledge in my service, I should use a less quantity of skill and knowledge in his. Perhaps, ultimately, it may appear desirable, or, to say the least, gracious, that I should give in return somewhat more than I received. But at present, we are concerned on the law of justice only, which is that of perfect and accurate exchange; --one circumstance only interfering with the simplicity of this radical idea of just payment -- that inasmuch as labour (rightly directed) is fruitful just as seed is, the fruit (or &quot;interest,&quot; as it is called) of the labour first given, or &quot;advanced,&quot; ought to be taken into account, and balanced by an additional quantity of labour in the subsequent repayment. Supposing the repayment to take place at the end of a year, or of any other given time, this calculation could be approximately made; but as money (that is to say, cash) payment involves no reference to time (it being optional with the person paid to spend what he receives at once or after any number of years), we can only assume, generally, that some slight advantage must in equity be allowed to the person who advances the labour, so that the typical form of bargain will be: If you give me an hour to-day, I will give you an hour and five minutes on demand. If you give me a pound of bread to day, I will give you seventeen ounces on demand, and so on. All that it is necessary for the reader to note is, that the amount returned is at least in equity not to be less than the
amount given.

The abstract idea, then, of just or due wages, as respects the labourer, is that they will consist in a sum of money which will at any time procure for him at least as much labour as he has given, rather more than less. And this equity or justice of payment is, observe, wholly independent of any reference to the number of men who are willing to do the work. I want a horseshoe for my horse. Twenty smiths, or twenty thousand smiths, may be ready to forge it; their number does not in one atom's weight affect the question of the equitable payment of the one who does forge it. It costs him a quarter of an hour of his life, and so much skill and strength of arm to make that horseshoe for me. Then at some future time I am bound in equity to give a quarter of an hour, and some minutes more, of my life (or of some other person's at my disposal), and also as much strength of arm and skill, and a little more, in making or doing what the smith may
have need of.

Such being the abstract theory of just remunerative payment, its application is practically modified by the fact that the order for labour, given in payment, is general, while labour received is special. The current coin or document is practically an order on the nation for so much work of any kind; and this universal applicability to immediate need renders it so much more valuable than special labour can be, that an order for a less quantity of this general toil will always be accepted as a just equivalent for a greater quantity of special toil. Any given craftsman will always be willing to give an hour of his own work in order to receive command over half-an-hour, or even much less, of national work. This source of uncertainty, together. with the difficulty of determining the monetary value of skill,(10*) renders the ascertainment (even approximate) of the proper wages of any given labour in terms of a currency matter of considerable complexity. But they do not affect the principle of exchange. The worth of the work may not be easily known; but it has a worth, just as fixed and real as the specific gravity of a substance, though such specific gravity may not be easily ascertainable when the substance is united with many others. Nor is there so much difficulty or chance in determining it as in determining the ordinary maxima and minima of vulgar political economy. There are few bargains in which the buyer can ascertain with anything like precision that the seller would have taken no less; -- or the seller acquire more than a comfortable faith that the purchaser would have given no more. This impossibility of precise knowledge prevents neither from striving to attain the desired point of greatest vexation and injury to the other, nor from accepting it for a scientific principle that he is to buy for the least and sell for the most possible, though what the real least or most may be he cannot tell. In like manner, a just person lays it down for a scientific principle that he is to pay a just price, and, without being able precisely to ascertain the limits of such a price, will nevertheless strive to attain the closest possible approximation to them. A practically serviceable approximation he can obtain. It is easier to determine scientifically what a man ought to have for his work, than what his necessities will compel him to take for it. His necessities can only be ascertained by empirical, but his due by analytical, investigation. In the one case, you try your answer to the sum like a puzzled schoolboy --till you find one that fits; in the other, you bring out your
result within certain limits, by process of calculation.

Supposing, then, the just wages of any quantity of given labour to have been ascertained, let us examine the first results of just and unjust payment, when in favour of the purchaser or employer; i.e. when two men are ready to do the work, and only
one wants to have it done.

The unjust purchaser forces the two to bid against each other till he has reduced their demand to its lowest terms. Let us assume that the lowest bidder offers to do the work at half its just price.

The purchaser employs him, and does not employ the other. The first or apparent result is, therefore, that one of the two men is left out of employ, or to starvation, just as definitely as by the just procedure of giving fair price to the best workman. The various writers who endeavoured to invalidate the positions of my first paper never saw this, and assumed that the unjust hirer employed both. He employs both no more than the just hirer. The only difference (in the outset, is that the just man pays sufficiently, the unjust man insufficiently, for the labour of the single person employed.

I say, &quot;in the outset;&quot; for this first or apparent, difference is not the actual difference. By the unjust procedure, half the proper price of the work is left in the hands of the employer. This enables him to hire another man at the same unjust rate, on some other kind of work; and the final result is that he has two men working for him at half price, and two are out of
employ.

By the just procedure, the whole price of the first piece of work goes in the hands of the man who does it. No surplus being left in the employer's hands, he cannot hire another man for another piece of labour. But by precisely so much as his power is diminished, the hired workman's power is increased; that is to say, by the additional half of the price he has received; which additional half he has the power of using to employ another man in his service. I will suppose, for the moment, the least favourable, though quite probable, case -- that, though justly treated himself, he yet will act unjustly to his subordinate; and hire at half-price, if he can. The final result will then be, that one man works for the employer, at just price; one for the workman, at half-price; and two, as in the first case, are still out of employ. These two, as I said before, are out of employ in both cases. The difference between the just and unjust procedure does not lie in the number of men hired, but in the price paid to them, and the persons by whom it is paid. The essential difference, that which I want the reader to see clearly, is, that in the unjust case, two men work for one, the first hirer. In the just case, one man works for the first hirer, one for the person hired, and so on, down or up through the various grades of service; the influence being carried forward by justice, and arrested by injustice. The universal and constant action of justice in this matter is therefore to diminish the power oF wealth, in the hands of one individual, over masses of men, and to distribute it through a chain of men. The actual power exerted by the wealth is the same in both cases; but by injustice it is put all into one man's hands, so that he directs at once and with equal force the labour of a circle of men about him; by the just procedure, he is permitted to touch the nearest only, through whom, with diminished force, modified by new minds, the energy of
the wealth passes on to others, and so till it exhausts itself.

The immediate operation of justice in this respect is therefore to diminish the power of wealth, first in acquisition of luxury, and, secondly, in exercise of moral influence. The employer cannot concentrate so multitudinous labour on his own interests, nor can he subdue so multitudinous mind to his own will. But the secondary operation of justice is not less important. The insufficient payment of the group of men working for one, places each under a maximum of difficulty in rising above his position. The tendency of the system is to check advancement. But the sufficient or just payment, distributed through a descending series oF offices or grades or labour,(11*) gives each subordinated person fair and sufficient means of rising in the social scale, if he chooses to use them; and thus not only diminishes the immediate power of wealth, but removes
the worst disabilities of poverty.

It is on this vital problem that the entire destiny of the labourer is ultimately dependent. Many minor interests may sometimes appear to interfere with it, but all branch from it. For instance, considerable agitation is often caused in the minds of the lower classes when they discover the share which they nominally, and to all appearance, actually, pay out of their wages in taxation (I believe thirty-five or forty per cent). This sounds very grievous; but in reality the labourer does not pay it, but his employer. If the workman had not to pay it, his wages would be less by just that sum: competition would still reduce them to the lowest rate at which life was possible. Similarly the lower orders agitated for the repeal of the corn laws,(12*) thinking they would be better off if bread were cheaper; never perceiving that as soon as bread was permanently cheaper, wages would permanently fall in precisely that proportion. The corn laws were rightly repealed; not, however, because they directly oppressed the poor, but because they indirectly oppressed them in causing a large quantity of their labour to be consumed unproductively. So also unnecessary taxation oppresses them, through destruction of capital, but the destiny of the poor depends primarily always on this one question of dueness of wages. Their distress (irrespectively of that caused by sloth, minor error, or crime) arises on the grand scale from the two reacting forces of competition and oppression. There is not yet, nor will yet for ages be, any real over-population in the world; but a local over-population, or, more accurately, a degree of population locally unmanageable under existing circumstances for want of forethought and sufficient machinery, necessarily shows itself by pressure of competition; and the taking advantage of this competition by the purchaser to obtain their labour unjustly cheap, consummates at once their suffering and his own; for in this (as I believe in every other kind of slavery) the oppressor suffers at last more than the oppressed, and those magnificent lines of Pope, even in all their force, fall short of the truth
-- 

 ''Yet, to be just to these poor men of pelf, Each does but HATE HIS NEIGHBOUR AS HIMSELF: Damned to the mines, an equal fate betides
 The slave that digs it, and the slave that hides.''

The collateral and reversionary operations of justice in this matter I shall examine hereafter (it being needful first to define the nature of value); proceeding then to consider within what practical terms a juster system may be established; and ultimately the vexed question of the destinies of the unemployed workmen.(13*) Lest, however, the reader should be alarmed at some of the issues to which our investigations seem to be tending, as if in their bearing against the power of wealth they had something in common with those of socialism, I wish him to know in accurate terms, one or two of the main points which I have in
view.

Whether socialism has made more progress among the army and navy (where payment is made on my principles), or among the manufacturing operatives (who are paid on my opponents' principles), I leave it to those opponents to ascertain and declare. Whatever their conclusion may be, I think it necessary to answer for myself only this: that if there be any one point insisted on throughout my works more frequently than another, that one point is the impossibility of Equality. My continual aim has been to show the eternal superiority of some men to others, sometimes even of one man to all others; and to show also the advisability of appointing such persons or person to guide, to lead, or on occasion even to compel and subdue, their inferiors, according to their own better knowledge and wiser will. My principles of Political Economy were all involved in a single phrase spoken three years ago at Manchester. &quot;Soldiers of the Ploughshare as well as soldiers of the Sword:&quot; and they were all summed in a single sentence in the last volume of Modern Painters -- &quot;Government and co-operation are in all things the Laws of
Life; Anarchy and competition the Laws of Death.&quot;

And with respect to the mode in which these general principles affect the secure possession of property, so far am I from invalidating such security, that the whole gist of these papers will be found ultimately to aim at an extension in its range; and whereas it has long been known and declared that the poor have no right to the property of the rich, I wish it also to be known and declared that the rich have no right to the property
of the poor.

But that the working of the system which I have undertaken to develope would in many ways shorten the apparent and direct, though not the unseen and collateral, power, both of wealth, as the Lady of Pleasure, and of capital as the Lord of Toil, I do not deny on the contrary, I affirm it in all joyfulness; knowing that the attraction of riches is already too strong, as their authority is already too weighty, for the reason of mankind. I said in my last paper that nothing in history had ever been so disgraceful to human intellect as the acceptance among us of the common doctrines of political economy as a science. I have many grounds for saying this, but one of the chief may be given in few words. I know no previous instance in history of a nation's establishing a systematic disobedience to the first principles of its professed religion. The writings which we (verbally) esteem as divine, not only denounce the love of money as the source of all evil, and as an idolatry abhorred of the Deity, but declare mammon service to be the accurate and irreconcileable opposite of God's service: and, whenever they speak of riches absolute, and poverty absolute, declare woe to the rich, and blessing to the poor. Where upon we forthwith investigate a science of becoming
rich as the shortest road to national prosperity.

==Ad Valorem==
We saw that just payment of labour consisted in a sum of money which would approximately obtain equivalent labour at a future time: we have now to examine the means of obtaining such equivalence. Which question involves the definition of Value,
Wealth, Price, and Produce.

None of these terms are yet defined so as to be understood by the public. But the last, Produce, which one might have thought the clearest of all, is, in use, the most ambiguous; and the examination of the kind of ambiguity attendant on its present
employment will best open the way to our work.

In his chapter on Capital,(14*) Mr J.S. Mill instances, as a capitalist, a hardware manufacturer, who, having intended to spend a certain portion of the proceeds of his business in buying plate and jewels, changes his mind, and, 'pays it as wages to additional workpeople.&quot; The effect is stated by Mr Mill to be, that &quot;more food is appropriated to the consumption of productive
labourers.&quot;

Now I do not ask, though, had I written this paragraph, it would surely have been asked of me, What is to become of the silversmiths? If they are truly unproductive persons, we will acquiesce in their extinction. And though in another part of the same passage, the hardware merchant is supposed also to dispense with a number of servants, whose &quot;food is thus set free for productive purposes,&quot; I do not inquire what will be the effect, painful or otherwise, upon the servants, of this emancipation of their food. But I very seriously inquire why ironware is produce, and silverware is not? That the merchant consumes the one, and sells the other, certainly does not constitute the difference, unless it can be shown (which, indeed, I perceive it to be becoming daily more and more the aim of tradesmen to show) that commodities are made to be sold, and not to be consumed. The merchant is an agent of conveyance to the consumer in one case, and is himself the consumer in the other:(15*) but the labourers are in either case equally productive, since they have produced goods to the same value, if the hardware and the plate are both
goods.

And what distinction separates them? It is indeed possible that in the &quot;comparative estimate of the moralist,&quot; with which Mr Mill says political economy has nothing to do (III. i. 2), a steel fork might appear a more substantial production than a silver one: we may grant also that knives, no less than forks, are good produce; and scythes and ploughshares serviceable articles. But, how of bayonets? Supposing the hardware merchant to effect large sales of these, by help of the &quot;setting free&quot; of the food of his servants and his silversmith, -- is he still employing productive labourers, or, in Mr Mill's words, labourers who increase &quot;the stock of permanent means of enjoyment&quot; (I. iii. 4)? Or if, instead of bayonets, he supply bombs, will not the absolute and final &quot;enjoyment&quot; of even these energetically productive articles (each of which costs ten pounds(16*)) be dependent on a proper choice of time and place for their enfantement; choice, that is to say, depending on those philosophical considerations with which political economy has
nothing to do?(17*)

I should have regretted the need of pointing out inconsistency in any portion of Mr Mill's work, had not the value of his work proceeded from its inconsistencies. He deserves honour among economists by inadvertently disclaiming the principles which he states, and tacitly introducing the moral considerations with which he declares his science has no connection. Many of his chapters are, therefore, true and valuable; and the only conclusions of his which I have to dispute
are those which follow from his premises.

Thus, the idea which lies at the root of the passage we have just been examining, namely, that labour applied to produce luxuries will not support so many persons as labour applied to produce useful articles, is entirely true; but the instance given fails -- and in four directions of failure at once-because Mr Mill has not defined the real meaning of usefulness. The definition which he has given-&quot; capacity to satisfy a desire, or serve a purpose&quot; (III. i. 2) -- applies equally to the iron and silver. while the true definition which he has not given, but which nevertheless underlies the false verbal definition in his mind, and comes out once or twice by accident (as in the words &quot;any support to life or strength&quot; in I. iii. 5) -- applies to some articles of iron, but not to others, and to some articles of silver, but not to others. It applies to ploughs, but not to
bayonets; and to forks, but not to filigree.(18*)

The eliciting of the true definitions will give us the reply to our first question, &quot;What is value?&quot; respecting which, however, we must first hear the popular statements.

&quot;The word 'value,' when used without adjunct, always means, in political economy, value in exchange&quot; (Mill, III. i. 2). So that, if two ships cannot exchange their rudders, their rudders are, in politico-economic language, of no value to either.

But &quot;the subject of political economy is wealth.&quot; --(Preliminary remarks, page 1)

And wealth &quot;consists of all useful and agreeable objects which possess exchangeable value.&quot; -- (Preliminary remarks, page 10.)

It appears, then, according to Mr Mill, that usefulness and agreeableness underlie the exchange value, and must be ascertained to exist in the thing, before we can esteem it an object of wealth.

Now, the economical usefulness of a thing depends not merely on its own nature, but on the number of people who can and will use it. A horse is useless, and therefore unsaleable, if no one can ride, -- a sword, if no one can strike, and meat, if no one can eat. Thus every material utility depends on its relative human capacity.

Similarly: The agreeableness of a thing depends not merely on its own likeableness, but on the number of people who can be got to like it. The relative agreeableness, and therefore saleableness, of &quot;a pot of the smallest ale,&quot; and of &quot;Adonis painted by a running brook,&quot; depends virtually on the opinion of Demos, in the shape of Christopher Sly. That is to say, the agreeableness of a thing depends on its relatively human disposition.(19*) Therefore, political economy, being a science of wealth, must be a science respecting human capacities and dispositions. But moral considerations have nothing to do with political economy (III. i. 2). Therefore, moral considerations
have nothing to do with human capacities and dispositions.

I do not wholly like the look of this conclusion from Mr Mill's statements: -- let us try Mr Ricardo's.

&quot;Utility is not the measure of exchangeable value, though it is absolutely essential to it.&quot; -- (Chap. I. sect. i) essential in what degree, Mr Ricardo? There may be greater and less degrees of utility. Meat, for instance, may be so good as to be fit for any one to eat, or so bad as to be fit for no one to eat. What is the exact degree of goodness which is &quot;essential&quot; to its exchangeable value, but not &quot;the measure&quot; of it? How good must the meat be, in order to possess any exchangeable value; and how bad must it be -- (I wish this were a settled question in London
markets) -- in order to possess none?

There appears to be some hitch, I think, in the working even of Mr. Ricardo's principles; but let him take his own example. &quot;Suppose that in the early stages of society the bows and arrows of the hunter were of equal value with the implements of the fisherman. Under such circumstances the value of the deer, the produce of the hunter's day's labour, would be exactly equal to the value of the fish, the product of the fisherman's day's labour, The comparative value of the fish and game would be entirely regulated by the quantity of labour realized in each.&quot;
(Ricardo, chap. iii. On Value).

Indeed! Therefore, if the fisherman catches one sprat. and the huntsman one deer, one sprat will be equal in value to one deer but if the fisherman catches no sprat, and the huntsman two deer, no sprat will be equal in value to two deer?

Nay but -- Mr Ricardo's supporters may say -- he means, on an average, -if the average product of a day's work of fisher and hunter be one fish and one deer, the one fish will always be equal in value to the one deer.

Might I inquire the species of fish? Whale? or white-bait?(20*)

It would be waste of time to purpose these fallacies farther;
we will seek for a true definition.

Much store has been set for centuries upon the use of our English classical education. It were to be wished that our well-educated merchants recalled to mind always this much of their latin schooling, -- that the nominative of valorem (a word already sufficiently familiar to them) is valor; a word which, therefore, ought to be familiar to them. Valor, from valere, to be well or strong; -- strong, life (if a man), or valiant; strong, for life (if a thing), or valuable. To be &quot;valuable,&quot; therefore, is to &quot;avail towards life.&quot; A truly valuable or availing thing is that which leads to life with its whole strength. In proportion as it does not lead to life, or as its strength is broken, it is less valuable; in proportion as it
leads away from life, it is unvaluable or malignant.

The value of a thing, therefore, is independent of opinion, and of quantity. Think what you will of it, gain how much you may of it, the value of the thing itself is neither greater nor less. For ever it avails, or avails not; no estimate can raise, no disdain repress, the power which it holds from the Maker of
things and of men.

The real science of political economy, which has yet to be distinguished from the bastard science, as medicine from witchcraft, and astronomy from astrology, is that which teaches nations to desire and labour for the things that lead to life: and which teaches them to scorn and destroy the things that lead to destruction. And if, in a state of infancy, they supposed indifferent things, such as excrescences of shell-fish, and pieces of blue and red stone, to be valuable, and spent large measures of the labour which ought to be employed for the extension and ennobling of life, in diving or digging for them, and cutting them into various shapes,or if, in the same state of infancy, they imagine precious and beneficent things, such as air, light, and cleanliness, to be valueless,-or if, finally, they imagine the conditions of their own existence, by which alone they can truly possess or use anything, such, for instance, as peace, trust, and love, to be prudently exchangeable, when the markets offer, for gold, iron, or excresrences of shells -- the great and only science of Political Economy teaches them, in all these cases, what is vanity, and what substance; and how the service of Death, the lord of Waste, and of eternal emptiness, differs from the service of Wisdom, the lady of Saving, and of eternal fulness; she who has said, &quot;I will cause those that love
me to inherit SUBSTANCE; and I will FILL their treasures.&quot;

The &quot;Lady of Saving,&quot; in a profounder sense than that of the savings bank, though that is a good one: Madonna della Salute, --Lady of Health, -- which, though commonly spoken of as if separate from wealth, is indeed a part of wealth. This word,
&quot;wealth,&quot; it will be remembered, is the next we have to define.

&quot;To be wealthy&quot; says Mr Mill, &quot;is to have a large stock of useful articles.&quot; I accept this definition. Only let us perfectly understand it. My opponents often lament my not giving them enough logic: I fear I must at present use a little more than they will like: but this business of Political Economy is no
light one, and we must allow no loose terms in it.

We have, therefore, to ascertain in the above definition, first, what is the meaning of &quot;having,&quot; or the nature of Possession. Then what is the meaning of &quot;useful,&quot; or the nature of Utility.

And first of possession. At the crossing of the transepts of Milan Cathedral has lain, for three hundred years, the embalmed body of St. Carlo Borromeo. It holds a golden crosier, and has a cross of emeralds on its breast. Admitting the crosier and emeralds to be useful articles, is the body to be considered as &quot;having&quot; them? Do they, in the politico-economical sense of property, belong to it? If not, and if we may, therefore, conclude generally that a dead body cannot possess property, what degree and period of animation in the body will render possession possible?

As thus: lately in a wreck of a Californian ship, one of the passengers fastened a belt about him with two hundred pounds of gold in it, with which he was found afterwards at the bottom. Now, as he was sinking -- had he the gold? or had the gold
him?(21*)

And if, instead of sinking him in the sea by its weight, the gold had struck him on the forehead, and thereby caused incurable disease -- suppose palsy or insanity, -- would the gold in that case have been more a &quot;possession&quot; than in the first? Without pressing the inquiry up through instances of gradually increasing vital power over the gold (which I will, however, give, if they are asked for), I presume the reader will see that possession, or &quot;having,&quot; is not an absolute, but a gradated, power; and consists not only in the quantity or nature of the thing possessed, but also (and in a greater degree) in its suitableness to the person
possessing it and in his vital power to use it.

And our definition of Wealth, expanded, becomes: &quot;The possession of useful articles, which we can use.&quot; This is a very serious change. For wealth, instead of depending merely on a &quot;have,&quot; is thus seen to depend on a &quot;can.&quot; Gladiator's death, on a &quot;habet&quot;; but soldier's victory, and State's salvation, on a &quot;quo plurimum posset.&quot; (liv. VII. 6.) And what we reasoned of only as accumulation of material, is seen to demand also
accumulation of capacity.

So much for our verb. Next for our adjective. What is the meaning of &quot;useful&quot;?

The inquiry is closely connected with the last. For what is capable of use in the hands of some persons, is capable, in the hands of others, of the opposite of use, called commonly &quot;from-use,&quot; or &quot;ab-use.&quot; And it depends on the person, much more than on the article, whether its usefulness or ab-usefulness will be the quality developed in it. Thus, wine, which the Greeks, in their Bacchus, made rightly the type of all passion, and which, when used, &quot;cheereth god and man&quot; (that is to say, strengthens both the divine life, or reasoning power, and the earthy, or carnal power, of man); yet, when abused, becomes &quot;Dionysos,&quot; hurtful especially to the divine part of man, or reason. And again, the body itself, being equally liable to use and to abuse, and, when rightly disciplined, serviceable to the State, both for war and labour, -- but when not disciplined, or abused, valueless to the State, and capable only of continuing the private or single existence of the individual (and that but feebly) -- the Greeks called such a body an &quot;idiotic&quot; or &quot;private&quot; body, from their word signifying a person employed in no way directly useful to the State; whence finally, our &quot;idiot,&quot; meaning a person
entirely occupied with his own concerns.

Hence, it follows that if a thing is to be useful, it must be not only of an availing nature, but in availing hands. Or, in accurate terms, usefulness is value in the hands of the valiant; so that this science of wealth being, as we have just seen, when regarded as the science of Accumulation, accumulative of capacity as well as of material, -- when regarded as the Science of Distribution, is distribution not absolute, but discriminate; not of every thing to every man, but of the right thing to the right
man. A difficult science, dependent on more than arithmetic.

Wealth, therefore, is &quot;THE POSSESSION OF THE VALUABLE BY THE VALIANT&quot;; and in considering it as a power existing in a nation, the two elements, the value of the thing, and the valour of its possessor, must be estimated together. Whence it appears that many of the persons commonly considered wealthy, are in reality no more wealthy than the locks of their own strong boxes are, they being inherently and eternally incapable of wealth; and operating for the nation, in an economical point of view, either as pools of dead water, and eddies in a stream (which, so long as the stream flows, are useless, or serve only to drown people, but may become of importance in a state of stagnation should the stream dry); or else, as dams in a river, of which the ultimate service depends not on the dam, but the miller; or else, as mere accidental stays and impediments, acting not as wealth, but (for we ought to have a correspondent term) as &quot;illth,&quot; causing various devastation and trouble around them in all directions; or lastly, act not at all, but are merely animated conditions of delay, (no use being possible of anything they have until they are dead,) in which last condition they are nevertheless often useful as delays, and &quot;impedimenta,&quot; if a nation is apt to move
too fast.

This being so, the difficulty of the true science of Political Economy lies not merely in the need of developing manly character to deal with material value, but in the fact, that while the manly character and material value only form wealth by their conjunction, they have nevertheless a mutually destructive operation on each other. For the manly character is apt to ignore, or even cast away, the material value: -- whence that of
Pope: --

    ''Sure, of qualities demanding praise, More go to ruin fortunes, than to raise.''

And on the other hand, the material value is apt to undermine the manly character; so that it must be our work, in the issue, to examine what evidence there is of the effect of wealth on the minds of its possessors; also, what kind of person it is who usually sets himself to obtain wealth, and succeeds in doing so; and whether the world owes more gratitude to rich or to poor men, either for their moral influence upon it, or for chief goods, discoveries, and practical advancements. I may, however, anticipate future conclusions, so far as to state that in a community regulated only by laws of demand and supply, but protected from open violence, the persons who become rich are, generally speaking, industrious, resolute, proud, covetous, prompt, methodical, sensible, unimaginative, insensitive, and ignorant. The persons who remain poor are the entirely foolish, the entirely wise,(22*) the idle, the reckless, the humble, the thoughtful, the dull, the imaginative, the sensitive, the well-informed, the improvident, the irregularly and impulsively wicked, the clumsy knave, the open thief, and the entirely
merciful, just, and godly person.

Thus far, then, of wealth. Next, we have to ascertain the nature of PRICE; that is to say, of exchange value, and its
expression by currencies.

Note first, of exchange, there can be no profit in it. It is only in labour there can be profit -- that is to say, a &quot;making in advance,&quot; or &quot;making in favour of&quot; (from proficio). In exchange, there is only advantage, i.e., a bringing of vantage or power to the exchanging persons. Thus, one man, by sowing and reaping, turns one measure of corn into two measures. That is Profit. Another, by digging and forging, turns one spade into two spades. That is Profit. But the man who has two measures of corn wants sometimes to dig; and the man who has two spades wants sometimes to eat:They exchange the gained grain for the gained tool; and both are the better for the exchange; but though there is much advantage in the transaction, there is no profit. Nothing is constructed or produced. Only that which had been before constructed is given to the person by whom it can be used. If labour is necessary to effect the exchange, that labour is in reality involved in the production, and, like all other labour, bears profit. Whatever number of men are concerned in the manufacture, or in the conveyance, have share in the profit; but neither the manufacture nor the conveyance are the exchange, and
in the exchange itself there is no profit.

There may, however, be acquisition, which is a very different thing. If, in the exchange, one man is able to give what cost him little labour for what has cost the other much, he &quot;acquires&quot; a certain quantity of the produce of the other's labour. And precisely what he acquires, the other loses. In mercantile language, the person who thus acquires is commonly said to have &quot;made a profit&quot;; and I believe that many of our merchants are seriously under the impression that it is possible for everybody, somehow, to make a profit in this manner. Whereas, by the unfortunate constitution of the world we live in, the laws both of matter and motion have quite rigorously forbidden universal acquisition of this kind. Profit, or material gain, is attainable only by construction or by discovery; not by exchange. Whenever material gain follows exchange, for every plus there is a
precisely equal minus.

Unhappily for the progress of the science of Political Economy, the plus quantities, or, -- if I may be allowed to coin an awkward plural -- the pluses, make a very positive and venerable appearance in the world, so that every one is eager to learn the science which produces results so magnificent; whereas the minuses have, on the other hand, a tendency to retire into back streets, and other places of shade, -- or even to get themselves wholly and finally put out of sight in graves: which renders the algebra of this science peculiar, and difficultly legible; a large number of its negative signs being written by the account-keeper in a kind of red ink, which starvation thins, and makes strangely pale, or even quite invisible ink, for the
present.

The Science of Exchange, or, as I hear it has been proposed to call it, of &quot;Catallactics,&quot; considered as one of gain, is, therefore, simply nugatory; but considered as one of acquisition, it is a very curious science, differing in its data and basis from every other science known. Thus: -- if I can exchange a needle with a savage for a diamond, my power of doing so depends either on the savage's ignorance of social arrangements in Europe, or on his want of power to take advantage of them, by selling the diamond to any one else for more needles. If, farther, I make the bargain as completely advantageous to myself as possible, by giving to the savage a needle with no eye in it (reaching, thus a sufficiently satisfactory type of the perfect operation of catallactic science), the advantage to me in the entire transaction depends wholly upon the ignorance, powerlessness, or heedlessness of the person dealt with. Do away with these, and catallactic advantage becomes impossible. So far, therefore, as the science of exchange relates to the advantage of one of the exchanging persons only, it is founded on the ignorance or incapacity of the opposite person. Where these vanish, it also vanishes. It is therefore a science founded on nescience, and an art founded on artlessness. But all other sciences and arts, except this, have for their object the doing away with their opposite nescience and artlessness. This science, alone of sciences, must, by all available means, promulgate and prolong its opposite nescience; otherwise the science itself is impossible. It is, therefore, peculiarly and alone the science of darkness; probably a bastard science -- not by any means a divina scientia, but one begotten of another father, that father who, advising his children to turn stones into bread, is himself employed in turning bread into stones, and who, if you ask a fish of him (fish not being producible on his estate), can but give
you a serpent.

The general law, then, respecting just or economical exchange, is simply this: -- There must be advantage on both sides (or if only advantage on one, at least no disadvantage on the other) to the persons exchanging; and just payment for his time, intelligence, and labour, to any intermediate person effecting the transaction (commonly called a merchant); and whatever advantage there is on either side, and whatever pay is given to the intermediate person, should be thoroughly known to all concerned. All attempt at concealment implies some practice of the opposite, or undivine science, founded on nescience. Whence another saying of the Jew merchant's -- &quot;As a nail between the stone joints, so doth sin stick fast between buying and selling.&quot; Which peculiar riveting of stone and timber, in men's dealings with each other, is again set forth in the house which was to be destroyed -- timber and stones together -- when Zechariah's roll (more probably &quot;curved sword&quot;) flew over it: &quot;the curse that goeth forth over all the earth upon every one that stealeth and holdeth himself guiltless,&quot; instantly followed by the vision of the Great Measure; -- the measure &quot;of the injustice of them in all the earth&quot; (auti i adikia auton en pase te ge), with the weight of lead for its lid, and the woman, the spirit of wickedness, within it; -- that is to say, Wickedness hidden by Dulness, and formalized, outwardly, into ponderously established cruelty. &quot; It shall be set upon its own base in the
land of Babel.&quot; (23*)

I have hitherto carefully restricted myself, in speaking of exchange, to the use of the term &quot;advantage&quot;; but that term includes two ideas; the advantage, namely, of getting what we need, and that of getting what we wish for. Three-fourths of the demands existing in the world are romantic; founded on visions, idealisms, hopes, and affections; and the regulation of the purse is, in its essence, regulation of the imagination and the heart. Hence, the right discussion of the nature of price is a very high metaphysical and psychical problem; sometimes to be solved only in a passionate manner, as by David in his counting the price of the water of the well by the gate of Bethlehem; but its first conditions are the following: -- The price of anything is the quantity of labour given by the person desiring it, in order to obtain possession of it. This price depends on four variable quantities. A. The quantity of wish the purchaser has for the thing; opposed to a, the quantity of wish the seller has to keep it. B. The quantity of labour the purchaser can afford, to obtain the thing opposed to B, the quantity of labour the seller can afford, to keep it. These quantities are operative only in excess; i.e. the quantity of wish (A) means the quantity of wish for this thing, above wish for other things; and the quantity of work (B) means the quantity which can be spared to get this thing
from the quantity needed to get other things.

Phenomena of price, therefore, are intensely complex, curious, and interesting -- too complex, however, to be examined yet; every one of them, when traced far enough, showing itself at last as a part of the bargain of the Poor of the Flock (or &quot;flock of slaughter&quot;), &quot;If ye think good, give ME my price, and if not, forbear&quot; Zech. xi. 12; but as the price of everything is to be calculated finally in labour, it is necessary to define the
nature of that standard.

Labour is the contest of the life of man with an opposite; --the term &quot;life&quot; including his intellect, soul, and physical power, contending with question, difficulty, trial, or material
force.

Labour is of a higher or lower order, as it includes more or fewer of the elements of life: and labour of good quality, in any kind, includes always as much intellect and feeling as will fully
and harmoniously regulate the physical force.

In speaking of the value and price of labour, it is necessary always to understand labour of a given rank and quality, as we should speak of gold or silver of a given standard. Bad (that is, heartless, inexperienced, or senseless) labour cannot be valued;
it is like gold of uncertain alloy, or flawed iron.(24*)

The quality and kind of labour being given, its value, like that of all other valuable things, is invariable. But the quantity of it which must be given for other things is variable: and in estimating this variation, the price of other things must always be counted by the quantity of labour; not the price of
labour by the quantity of other things.

Thus, if we want to plant an apple sapling in rocky ground, it may take two hours' work; in soft ground, perhaps only half an hour. Grant the soil equally good for the tree in each case. Then the value of the sapling planted by two hours' work is nowise greater than that of the sapling planted in half an hour. One will bear no more fruit than the other. Also, one half-hour of work is as valuable as another half-hour; nevertheless the one sapling has cost four such pieces of work, the other only one. Now the proper statement of this fact is, not that the labour on the hard ground is cheaper than on the soft; but that the tree is dearer. The exchange value may, or may not, afterwards depend on this fact. If other people have plenty of soft ground to plant in, they will take no cognizance of our two hours' labour, in the price they will offer for the plant on the rock. And if, through want of sufficient botanical science, we have planted an upas tree instead of an apple, the exchange-value will be a negative
quantity; still less proportionate to the labour expended.

What is commonly called cheapness of labour, signifies, therefore, in reality, that many obstacles have to be overcome by it; so that much labour is required to produce a small result. But this should never be spoken of as cheapness of labour, but as dearness of the object wrought for. It would be just as rational to say that walking was cheap, because we had ten miles to walk home to our dinner, as that labour was cheap, because we had to
work ten hours to earn it.

The last word which we have to define is &quot;Production.&quot;

I have hitherto spoken of all labour as profitable; because it is impossible to consider under one head the quality or value of labour, and its aim. But labour of the best quality may be various in aim. It may be either constructive (&quot;gathering&quot; from con and struo), as agriculture; nugatory, as jewel-cutting; or destructive (&quot;scattering,&quot; from de and struo), as war. It is not, however, always easy to prove labour, apparently nugatory, to be actually so;(25*) generally, the formula holds good: &quot;he that gathereth not, scattereth&quot;; thus, the jeweller's art is probably very harmful in its ministering to a clumsy and inelegant pride. So that, finally, I believe nearly all labour may be shortly divided into positive and negative labour: positive, that which produces life; negative, that which produces death; the most directly negative labour being murder, and the most directly positive, the bearing and rearing of children; so that in the precise degree in which murder is hateful, on the negative side of idleness, in the exact degree child-rearing is admirable, on the positive side of idleness. For which reason, and because of the honour that there is in rearing children,(26*) while the wife is said to be as the vine (for cheering), the children are as the olive branch, for praise: nor for praise only, but for peace (because large families can only be reared in times of peace): though since, in their spreading and voyaging in various directions, they distribute strength, they are, to the home strength, as arrives in the hand of the giant -- striking here,
and there far away.

Labour being thus various in its result, the prosperity of any nation is in exact proportion to the quantity of labour which it spends in obtaining and employing means of life. Observe, -- I say, obtaining and employing; that is to say, not merely wisely producing, but wisely distributing and consuming. Economists usually speak as if there were no good in consumption absolute.(27*) So far from this being so, consumption absolute is the end, crown, and perfection of production; and wise consumption is a far more difficult art than wise production. Twenty people can gain money for one who can use it; and the vital question, for individual and for nation, is, never &quot;how
much do they make?&quot; but &quot;to what purpose do they spend?&quot;

The reader may, perhaps, have been surprised at the slight reference I have hitherto made to &quot;capital,&quot; and its functions. It is here the place to define them.

Capital signifies &quot;head, or source, or root material&quot; -- it is material by which some derivative or secondary good is produced. It is only capital proper (caput vivum, not caput mortuum) when it is thus producing something different from itself. It is a root, which does not enter into vital function till it produces something else than a root: namely, fruit. That fruit will in time again produce roots; and so all living capital issues in reproduction of capital; but capital which produces nothing but capital is only root producing root; bulb issuing in bulb, never in tulip; seed issuing in seed, never in bread. The Political Economy of Europe has hitherto devoted itself wholly to the multiplication, or (less even) the aggregation, of bulbs. It never saw, nor conceived, such a thing as a tulip. Nay, boiled bulbs they might have been -- glass bulbs -- Prince Rupert's drops, consummated in powder (well, if it were glass-powder and not gunpowder), for any end or meaning the economists had in defining the laws of aggregation. We will try and get a clearer
notion of them.

The best and simplest general type of capital is a well-made ploughshare. Now, if that ploughshare did nothing but beget other ploughshares, in a polypous manner, -- however the great cluster of polypous plough might glitter in the sun, it would have lost its function of capital. It becomes true capital only by another kind of splendour, -- when it is seen &quot;splendescere sulco,&quot; to grow bright in the furrow; rather with diminution of its substance, than addition, by the noble friction. And the true home question, to every capitalist and to every nation, is not, &quot;how many ploughs have you?&quot; but, &quot;where are your furrows?&quot; not -- &quot;how quickly will this capital reproduce itself?&quot; -- but, &quot;what will it do during reproduction?&quot; What substance will it furnish, good for life? what work construct, protective of life? if none, its own reproduction is useless -- if worse than none, (for capital may destroy life as well as support it), its own reproduction is worse than useless; it is merely an advance from
Tisiphone, on mortgage -- not a profit by any means.

Not a profit, as the ancients truly saw, and showed in the type of Ixion; -- for capital is the head, or fountain head of wealth -- the &quot;well-head&quot; of wealth, as the clouds are the well-heads of rain; but when clouds are without water, and only beget clouds, they issue in wrath at last, instead of rain, and in lightning instead of harvest; whence Ixion is said first to have invited his guests to a banquet, and then made them fall into a pit, (as also Demas' silver mine,) after which, to show the rage of riches passing from lust of pleasure to lust of power, yet power not truly understood, Ixion is said to have desired Juno, and instead, embracing a cloud (or phantasm), to have begotten the Centaurs; the power of mere wealth being, in itself, as the embrace of a shadow, -- comfortless, (so also &quot;Ephraim feedeth on wind and followth after the east wind;&quot; or &quot;that which is not&quot; -- Prov. xxiii. 5; and again Dante's Geryon, the type of avaricious fraud, as he flies, gathers the air up with retractile claws, -- &quot;l'aer a se raccolse&quot;(28*)) but in its offspring, a mingling of the brutal with the human nature; human in sagacity -- using both intellect and arrow; but brutal in its body and hoof, for consuming, and trampling down. For which sin Ixion is at last bound upon a wheel -- fiery and toothed, and rolling perpetually in the air: -- the type of human labour when selfish and fruitless (kept far into the Middle Ages in their wheels of fortune); the wheel which has in it no breath or spirit, but is whirled by chance only; whereas of all true work the Ezekiel vision is true, that the Spirit of the living creature is in the wheels, and where the angels go, the wheels go
by them; but move no otherwise.

This being the real nature of capital, it follows that there are two kinds of true production, always going on in an active State: one of seed, and one of food; or production for the Ground, and for the Mouth; both of which are by covetous persons thought to be production only for the granary; whereas the function of the granary is but intermediate and conservative, fulfilled in distribution; else it ends in nothing but mildew, and nourishment of rats and worms. And since production for the Ground is only useful with future hope of harvest, all essential production is for the Mouth; and is finally measured by the mouth; hence, as I said above, consumption is the crown of production; and the wealth of a nation is only to be estimated by
what it consumes.

The want of any clear sight of this fact is the capital error, issuing in rich interest and revenue of error among the political economists. Their minds are continually set on money-gain, not on mouth-gain; and they fall into every sort of net and snare, dazzled by the coin-glitter as birds by the fowler's glass; or rather (for there is not much else like birds in them) they are like children trying to jump on the heads of their own shadows; the money-gain being only the shadow of the
true gain, which is humanity.

The final object of political economy, therefore, is to get good method of consumption, and great quantity of consumption: in other words, to use everything, and to use it nobly. whether it be substance, service, or service perfecting substance. The most curious error in Mr Mill's entire work, (provided for him originally by Ricardo,) is his endeavour to distinguish between direct and indirect service, and consequent assertion that a demand for commodities is not demand for labour (I. v. 9, et seq.). He distinguishes between labourers employed to lay out pleasure grounds, and to manufacture velvet; declaring that it makes material difference to the labouring classes in which of these two ways a capitalist spends his money; because the employment of the gardeners is a demand for labour, but the purchase of velvet is not.(29*) Error colossal, as well as strange. It will, indeed, make a difference to the labourer whether we bid him swing his scythe in the spring winds, or drive the loom in pestilential air. but, so far as his pocket is concerned, it makes, to him absolutely no difference whether we order him to make green velvet, with seed and a scythe, or red velvet, with silk and scissors. Neither does it anywise concern him whether, when the velvet is made, we consume it by walking on it, or wearing it, so long as our consumption of it is wholly selfish. But if our consumption is to be in anywise unselfish, not only our mode of consuming the articles we require interests him, but also the kind of article we require with a view to consumption. As thus (returning for a moment to Mr Mill's great hardware theory(30*)): it matters, so far as the labourer's immediate profit is concerned, not an iron filing whether I employ him in growing a peach, or forging a bombshell; but my probable mode of consumption of those articles matters seriously. Admit that it is to be in both cases &quot;unselfish,&quot; and the difference, to him, is final, whether when his child is ill, I walk into his cottage and give it the peach, or drop the shell
down his chimney, and blow his roof off.

The worst of it, for the peasant, is, that the capitalist's consumption of the peach is apt to be selfish, and of the shell, distributive;(31*) but, in all cases, this is the broad and general fact, that on due catallactic commercial principles, somebody's roof must go off in fulfilment of the bomb's destiny. You may grow for your neighbour, at your liking, grapes or grape-shot; he will also, catallactically, grow grapes or
grape-shot for you, and you will each reap what you have sown.

It is, therefore, the manner and issue of consumption which are the real tests of production. Production does not consist in things laboriously made, but in things serviceably consumable; and the question for the nation is not how much labour it employs, but how much life it produces. For as consumption is the end and aim of production, so life is the end and aim of
consumption.

I left this question to the reader's thought two months ago, choosing rather that he should work it out for himself than have it sharply stated to him. But now, the ground being sufficiently broken (and the details into which the several questions, here opened, must lead us, being too complex for discussion in the pages of a periodical, so that I must pursue them elsewhere), I desire, in closing the series of introductory papers, to leave this one great fact clearly stated. THERE IS NO WEALTH BUT LIFE. Life, including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration. That country is the richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings; that man is richest who, having perfected the functions of his own life to the utmost, has also the widest helpful influence, both personal,
and by means of his possessions, over the lives of others.

A strange political economy; the only one, nevertheless, that ever was or can be: all political economy founded on self-interest(32*) being but the fulfilment of that which once brought schism into the Policy of angels, and ruin into the
Economy of Heaven.

&quot;The greatest number of human beings noble and happy.&quot; But is the nobleness consistent with the number? Yes, not only consistent with it, but essential to it. The maximum of life can only be reached by the maximum of virtue. In this respect the law of human population differs wholly from that of animal life. The multiplication of animals is checked only by want of food, and by the hostility of races; the population of the gnat is restrained by the hunger of the swallow, and that of the swallow by the scarcity of gnats. Man, considered as an animal, is indeed limited by the same laws: hunger, or plague, or war, are the necessary and only restraints upon his increase, -- effectual restraints hitherto, -- his principal study having been how most swiftly to destroy himself, or ravage his dwelling-places, and his highest skill directed to give range to the famine, seed to the plague, and sway to the sword. But, considered as other than an animal, his increase is not limited by these laws. It is limited only by the limits of his courage and his love. Both of these have their bounds; and ought to have; his race has its bounds also; but these have not yet been reached, nor will be
reached for ages.

In all the ranges of human thought I know none so melancholy as the speculations of political economists on the population question. It is proposed to better the condition of the labourer by giving him higher wages. &quot;Nay,&quot; says the economist, -- &quot;if you raise his wages, he will either people down to the same point of misery at which you found him, or drink your wages away.&quot; He will. I know it. Who gave him this will? Suppose it were your own son of whom you spoke, declaring to me that you dared not take him into your firm, nor even give him his just labourer's wages, because if you did he would die of drunkenness, and leave half a score of children to the parish. &quot;Who gave your son these dispositions?&quot; -- I should enquire. Has he them by inheritance or by education? By one or other they must come; and as in him, so also in the poor. Either these poor are of a race essentially different from ours, and unredeemable (which, however, often implied, I have heard none yet openly say), or else by such care as we have ourselves received, we may make them continent and sober as ourselves-wise and dispassionate as we are models arduous of imitation. &quot;But,&quot; it is answered, &quot;they cannot receive education.&quot; Why not? That is precisely the point at issue. Charitable persons suppose the worst fault of the rich is to refuse the people meat; and the people cry for their meat, kept back by fraud, to the Lord of Multitudes.(33*) Alas! it is not meat of which the refusal is cruelest, or to which the claim is validest. The life is more than the meat. The rich not only refuse food to the poor; they refuse wisdom; they refuse virtue; they refuse salvation. Ye sheep without shepherd, it is not the pasture that has been shut from you, but the Presence. Meat! perhaps your right to that may be pleadable; but other rights have to be pleaded first. Claim your crumbs from the table, if you will; but claim them as children, not as dogs; claim your right to be fed, but claim more loudly your right to be holy,
perfect, and pure.

Strange words to be used of working people: &quot;What! holy; without any long robes nor anointing oils; these rough-jacketed, rough-worded persons; set to nameless and dishonoured service? Perfect! -- these, with dim eyes and cramped limbs, and slowly wakening minds? Pure -- these, with sensual desire and grovelling thought; foul of body, and coarse of soul?&quot; It may be so; nevertheless, such as they are, they are the holiest, perfectest, purest persons the earth can at present show. They may be what you have said; but if so, they yet are holier than we, who have
left them thus.

But what can be done for them? Who can clothe -- who teach --who restrain their multitudes? What end can there he for them at last, but to consume one another?

I hope for another end, though not, indeed, from any of the three remedies for over-population commonly suggested by economists.

These three are, in brief -- Colonization; Bringing in of
waste lands; or Discouragement of Marriage.

The first and second of these expedients merely evade or delay the question. It will, indeed, be long before the world has been all colonized, and its deserts all brought under cultivation. But the radical question is not how much habitable land is in the world, but how many human beings ought to be maintained on a given space of habitable land.

Observe, I say, ought to be, not how many can be. Ricardo, with his usual inaccuracy, defines what he calls the &quot;natural rate of wages&quot; as &quot;that which will maintain the labourer.&quot; Maintain him! yes; but how? -- the question was instantly thus asked of me by a working girl, to whom I read the passage. I will amplify her question for her. &quot;Maintain him, how?&quot; As, first, to what length of life? Out of a given number of fed persons how many are to be old -- how many young; that is to say, will you arrange their maintenance so as to kill them early -- say at thirty or thirty-five on the average, including deaths of weakly or ill-fed children? -- or so as to enable them to live out a natural life? You will feed a greater number, in the first case,(34*) by rapidity of succession; probably a happier number in the second: which does Mr Ricardo mean to be their natural
state, and to which state belongs the natural rate of wages?

Again: A piece of land which will only support ten idle, ignorant, and improvident persons, will support thirty or forty intelligent and industrious ones. Which of these is their natural
state, and to which of them belongs the natural rate of wages?

Again: If a piece of land support forty persons in industrious ignorance; and if, tired of this ignorance, they set apart ten of their number to study the properties of cones, and the sizes of stars; the labour of these ten, being withdrawn from the ground, must either tend to the increase of food in some transitional manner, or the persons set apart for sidereal and conic purposes must starve, or some one else starve instead of them. What is, therefore, the natural rate of wages of the scientific persons, and how does this rate relate to, or measure,
their reverted or transitional productiveness?

Again: If the ground maintains, at first, forty labourers in a peaceable and pious state of mind, but they become in a few years so quarrelsome and impious that they have to set apart five, to meditate upon and settle their disputes; -- ten, armed to the teeth with costly instruments, to enforce the decisions; and five to remind everybody in an eloquent manner of the existence of a God; what will be the result upon the general power of production, and what is the &quot;natural rate of wages&quot; of
the meditative, muscular, and oracular labourers?

Leaving these questions to be discussed, or waived, at their pleasure, by Mr Ricardo's followers, I proceed to state the main facts bearing on that probable future of the labouring classes which has been partially glanced at by Mr Mill. That chapter and the preceding one differ from the common writing of political economists in admitting some value in the aspect of nature, and expressing regret at the probability of the destruction of natural scenery. But we may spare our anxieties, on this head. Men can neither drink steam, nor eat stone. The maximum of population on a given space of land implies also the relative maximum of edible vegetable, whether for men or cattle; it implies a maximum of pure air; and of pure water. Therefore: a maximum of wood, to transmute the air, and of sloping ground, protected by herbage from the extreme heat of the sun, to feed the streams. All England may, if it so chooses, become one manufacturing town; and Englishmen, sacrificing themselves to the good of general humanity, may live diminished lives in the midst of noise, of darkness, and of deadly exhalation. But the world cannot become a factory, nor a mine. No amount of ingenuity will ever make iron digestible by the million, nor substitute hydrogen for wine. Neither the avarice nor the rage of men will ever feed them, and however the apple of Sodom and the grape of Gomorrah may spread their table for a time with dainties of ashes, and nectar of asps, -- so long as men live by bread, the far away valleys must laugh as they are covered with the gold of God, and the shouts of His happy multitudes ring round the wine-press and
the well.

Nor need our more sentimental economists fear the too wide spread of the formalities of a mechanical agriculture. The presence of a wise population implies the search for felicity as well as for food; nor can any population reach its maximum but through that wisdom which &quot;rejoices&quot; in the habitable parts of the earth. The desert has its appointed place and work; the eternal engine, whose beam is the earth's axle, whose beat is its year, and whose breath is its ocean, will still divide imperiously to their desert kingdoms, bound with unfurrowable rock, and swept by unarrested sand, their powers of frost and fire: but the zones and lands between, habitable, will be loveliest in habitation. The desire of the heart is also the light of the eyes. No scene is continually and untiringly loved, but one rich by joyful human labour; smooth in field; fair in garden; full in orchard; trim, sweet, and frequent in homestead; ringing with voices of vivid existence. No air is sweet that is silent; it is only sweet when full of low currents of under sound-triplets of birds, and murmur and chirp of insects, and deep-toned words of men, and wayward trebles of childhood. As the art of life is learned, it will be found at last that all lovely things are also necessary: -- the wild flower by the wayside, as well as the tended corn; and the wild birds and creatures of the by every wondrous word and unknowable work of God. Happy, in that he knew them not, nor did his fathers know; and that round about him reaches yet into the infinite, the amazement of his
existence.

Note, finally, that all effectual advancement towards this true felicity of the human race must be by individual, not public effort. Certain general measures may aid, certain revised laws guide, such advancement; but the measure and law which have first to be determined are those of each man's home. We continually hear it recommended by sagacious people to complaining neighbours (usually less well placed in the world than themselves), that they should &quot;remain content in the station in which Providence has placed them.&quot; There are perhaps some circumstances of life in which Providence has no intention that people should be content. Nevertheless, the maxim is on the whole a good one; but it is peculiarly for home use. That your neighbour should, or should not, remain content with his position, is not your business; but it is very much your business to remain content with your own. What is chiefly needed in England at the present day is to show the quantity of pleasure that may be obtained by a consistent, well-administered competence, modest, confessed, and laborious. We need examples of people who, leaving Heaven to decide whether they are to rise in the world, decide for them selves that they will be happy in it, and have resolved to seek-not greater wealth, but simpler pleasure; not higher fortune, but deeper felicity; making the first of possessions, self-possession; and honouring themselves in the harmless pride and calm pursuits of
piece.

Of which lowly peace it is written that &quot;justice&quot; and peace have kissed each other;&quot; and that the fruit of justice is &quot; sown in peace of them that make peace;&quot; not &quot;peace-makers&quot; in the common understanding -- reconcilers of quarrels; (though that function also follows on the greater one;) but peace-Creators; Givers of Calm. Which you cannot give, unless you first gain; nor is this gain one which will follow assuredly on any course of business, commonly so called. No form of gain is less probable, business being (as is shown in the language of all nations --polein from pelo, prasis from perao, venire, vendre, and venal, from venio, &amp;c.) essentially restless -- and probably contentious; -- having a raven-like mind to the motion to and fro, as to the carrion food; whereas the olive-feeding and bearing birds look for rest for their feet: thus it is said of Wisdom that she &quot;hath builded her house, and hewn out her seven pillars;&quot; and even when, though apt to wait long at the door-posts, she has to leave her house and go abroad, her paths
are peace also.

For us, at all events, her work must begin at the entry of the doors: all true economy is &quot;Law of the house.&quot; Strive to make that law strict, simple, generous: waste nothing, and grudge nothing. Care in nowise to make more of money, but care to make much of it; remembering always the great, palpable, inevitable fact -- the rule and root of all economy -- that what one person has, another cannot have; and that every atom of substance, of whatever kind, used or consumed, is so much human life spent; which, if it issue in the saving present life, or gaining more, is well spent, but if not, is either so much life prevented, or so much slain. In all buying, consider, first, what condition of existence you cause in the producers of what you buy; secondly, whether the sum you have paid is just to the producer, and in due proportion, lodged in his hands;(35*) thirdly, to how much clear use, for food, knowledge, or joy, this that you have bought can be put; and fourthly, to whom and in what way it can be most speedily and serviceably distributed: in all dealings whatsoever insisting on entire openness and stern fulfilment; and in all doings, on perfection and loveliness of accomplishment; especially on fineness and purity of all marketable commodity: watching at the same time for all ways of gaining, or teaching, powers of simple pleasure, and of showing oson en asphodelps geg oneiar -- the sum of enjoyment depending not on the quantity of
things tasted, but on the vivacity and patience of taste.

And if, on due and honest thought over these things, it seems that the kind of existence to which men are now summoned by every plea of pity and claim of right, may, for some time at least, not be a luxurious one; -- consider whether, even supposing it guiltless, luxury would be desired by any of us, if we saw clearly at our sides the suffering which accompanies it in the world. Luxury is indeed possible in the future -- innocent and exquisite; luxury for all, and by the help of all; but luxury at present can only be enjoyed by the ignorant; the cruelest man living could not sit at his feast, unless he sat blindfold. Raise the veil boldly; face the light; and if, as yet, the light of the eye can only be through tears, and the light of the body through sackcloth, go thou forth weeping, bearing precious seed, until the time come, and the kingdom, when Christ's gift of bread, and bequest of peace, shall be &quot;Unto this last as unto thee&quot;; and when, for earth's severed multitudes of the wicked and the weary, there shall be holier reconciliation than that of the narrow home, and calm economy, where the Wicked cease -- not from
trouble, but from troubling -- and the Weary are at rest.

NOTES:

1. The difference between the two modes of treatment, and between their effective material results, may be seen very accurately by a comparison of the relations of Esther and Charlie in Bleak House, with those of Miss Brass and the Marchioness in Master Humphrey's Clock.

The essential value and truth of Dickens's writings have been unwisely lost sight of by many thoughtful persons, merely because he presents his truth with some colour of caricature. Unwisely, because Dickens's caricature, though often gross, is never mistaken. Allowing for his manner of telling them, the things he tells us are always true. I wish that he could think it right to limit his brilliant exaggeration to works written only for public amusement; and when he takes up a subject of high national importance, such as that which he handled in Hard Times, that he would use severer and more accurate analysis. The usefulness of that work (to my mind, in several respects, the greatest he has written) is with many persons seriously diminished because Mr Bounderby is a dramatic monster, instead of a characteristic example of a worldly master; and Stephen Blackpool a dramatic perfection, instead of a characteristic example of an honest workman. But let us not lose the use of Dickens's wit and insight, because he chooses to speak in a circle of stage fire. He is entirely right in his main drift and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but especially Hard Times, should be studied with close and earnest care by persons interested in social questions. They will find much that is partial, and, because partial, apparently unjust; but if they examine all the evidence on the other side, which Dickens seems to overlook, it will appear, after all their trouble, that his
view was the finally right one, grossly and sharply told. 

2. I have been naturally asked several times, with respect to the sentence in the first of these papers, &quot;the bad workmen unemployed,&quot; &quot;But what are you to do with your bad unemployed workmen?&quot; Well, it seems to me the question might have occurred to you before. Your housemaid's place is vacant -- you give twenty pounds a year-two girls come for it, one neatly dressed, the other dirtily; one with good recommendations, the other with none. You do not, under these circumstances, usually ask the dirty one if she will come for fifteen pounds, or twelve; and, on her consenting, take her instead of the well-recommended one. Still less do you try to beat both down by making them bid against each other, till you can hire both, one at twelve pounds a year, and the other at eight. You simply take the one fittest for the place, and send away the other, not perhaps concerning yourself quite as much as you should with the question which you now impatiently put to me, &quot;What is to become of her?&quot; For all that I advise you to do, is to deal with workmen as with servants; and verily the question is of weight: &quot;Your bad
workman, idler, and rogue -- what are you to do with him?&quot;

We will consider of this presently: remember that the administration of a complete system of national commerce and industry cannot be explained in full detail within the space of twelve pages. Meantime, consider whether, there being confessedly some difficulty in dealing with rogues and idlers, it may not be advisable to produce as few of them as possible. If you examine into the history of rogues, you will find they are as truly manufactured articles as anything else, and it is just because our present system of political economy gives so large a stimulus to that manufacture that you may know it to be a false one. We had better seek for a system which will develop honest men, than for one which will deal cunningly with vagabonds. Let us reform our schools, and we shall find little reform needed in our
prisons. 

3. The disputes which exist respecting the real nature of money arise more from the disputants examining its functions on different sides, than from any real dissent in their opinions. All money, properly so called, is an acknowledgment of debt; but as such, it may either be considered to represent the labour and property of the creditor, or the idleness and penury of the debtor. The intricacy of the question has been much increased by the (hitherto necessary) use of marketable commodities, such as gold, silver, salt, shells, &amp;c., to give intrinsic value or security to currency; but the final and best definition of money is that it is a documentary promise ratified and guaranteed by the nation to give or find a certain quantity of labour on demand. A man's labour for a day is a better standard of value than a measure of any produce, because no produce ever maintains
a consistent rate of productibility. 

4. More accurately, Sun of Justness; but, instead of the harsh word &quot;Justness,&quot; the old English &quot;Righteousness&quot; being commonly employed, has, by getting confused with &quot;godliness,&quot; or attracting about it various vague and broken meanings. prevented most persons from receiving the force of the passages in which it occurs. The word &quot;righteousness&quot; properly refers to the justice of rule, or right, as distinguished from &quot;equity,&quot; which refers to the justice of balance. More broadly, Righteousness is King's justice; and Equity, Judge's justice; the King guiding or ruling all, the Judge dividing or discerning between opposites (therefore the double question, &quot;Man, who made me a ruler --dikastes -- or a dividermeristes -- over you?&quot;) Thus, with respect to the Justice of Choice (selection, the feebler and passive justice), we have from lego, -- lex, legal, loi, and loyal; and with respect to the Justice of Rule (direction, the stronger and active justice), we have from rego, -- rex, regal,
roi, and royal.

5. In another place written with the same meaning, &quot;Just, and having salvation.&quot;

6. &quot;Length of days in her right hand; in her left, riches and
honour.&quot;

7. I hear that several of our lawyers have been greatly amused by the statement in the first of these papers that a lawyer's function was to do justice. I did not intend it for a jest; nevertheless it will be seen that in the above passage neither the determination nor doing of justice are contemplated as functions wholly peculiar to the lawyer. Possibly, the more our standing armies, whether of soldiers, pastors, or legislators (the generic term &quot;pastor&quot; including all teachers, and the generic term &quot;lawyer&quot; including makers as well as interpreters of law), can be superseded by the force of national heroism, wisdom,
and honesty, the better it may be for the nation. 

8. It being the privilege of the fishes, as it is of rats and wolves, to live by the laws of demand and supply; but the
distinction of humanity, to live by those of right. 

9. It might appear at first that the market price of labour expressed such an exchange: but this is a fallacy, for the market price is the momentary price of the kind of labour required, but the just price is its equivalent of the productive labour of mankind. This difference will be analyzed in its place. It must be noted also that I speak here only of the exchangeable value of labour, not of that of commodities. The exchangeable value of a commodity is that of the labour required to produce it, multiplied into the force of the demand for it. If the value of the labour = x and the force of demand = y, the exchangeable value of the commodity is xy, in which if either x = 0, or y = 0,
xy = 0.

10. Under the term &quot;skill&quot; I mean to include the united force of experience, intellect, and passion in their operation on manual labour: and under the term &quot;passion,&quot; to include the entire range and agency of the moral feelings; from the simple patience and gentleness of mind which will give continuity and fineness to the touch, or enable one person to work without fatigue, and with good effect, twice as long as another, up to the qualities of character which renders science possible -- (the retardation of science by envy is one of the most tremendous losses in the economy of the present century) -- and to the incommunicable emotion and imagination which are the first and mightiest sources
of all value in art.

It is highly singular that political economists should not yet have perceived, if not the moral, at least the passionate element, to be an inextricable quantity in every calculation. I cannot conceive, for instance, how it was possible that Mr Mill should have followed the true clue so far as to write, -- &quot;No limit can be set to the importance -- even in a purely productive and material point of view -- of mere thought,&quot; without seeing that it was logically necessary to add also, &quot;and of mere feeling.&quot; And this the more, because in his first definition of labour he includes in the idea of it &quot;all feelings of a disagreeable kind connected with the employment of one's thoughts in a particular occupation.&quot; True; but why not also, &quot;feelings of an agreeable kind?&quot; It can hardly be supposed that the feelings which retard labour are more essentially a part of the labour than those which accelerate it. The first are paid for as pain, the second as power. The workman is merely indemified for the first; but the second both produce a part of the exchangeable
value of the work, and materially increase its actual quantity.

&quot;Fritz is with us. He is worth fifty thousand men.&quot; Truly, a large addition to the material force; -- consisting, however, be it observed, not more in operations carried on in Fritz's head, than in operations carried on in his armies' heart. &quot;No limit can be set to the importance of mere thought.&quot; Perhaps not! Nay, suppose some day it should turn out that &quot;mere&quot; thought was in itself a recommendable object of production, and that all Material production was only a step towards this more precious
Immaterial one?

11. I am sorry to lose time by answering, however curtly, the equivocations of the writers who sought to obscure the instances given of regulated labour in the first of these papers, by confusing kinds, ranks, and quantities of labour with its qualities. I never said that a colonel should have the same pay as a private, nor a bishop the same pay as a curate. Neither did I say that more work ought to be paid as less work (so that the curate of a parish of two thousand souls should have no more than the curate of a parish of five hundred). But I said that, so far as you employ it at all, bad work should be paid no less than good work; as a bad clergyman yet takes his tithes, a bad physician takes bis fee, and a bad lawyer his costs. And this, as will be farther shown in the conclusion, I said, and say, partly because the best work never was, nor ever will be, done for money at all; but chiefly because, the moment people know they have to pay the bad and good alike, they will try to discern the one from the other, and not use the bad. A sagacious writer in the Scotsman asks me if I should like any common scribbler to be paid by Messrs Smith, Elder and Co. as their good authors are. I should, if they employed him-but would seriously recommend them, for the scribbler's sake, as well as their own, not to employ him. The quantity of its money which the country at present invests in scribbling is not, in the outcome of it, economically spent; and even the highly ingenious person to whom this question occurred, might perhaps have been more beneficially employed than
in printing it. 

12. I have to acknowledge an interesting communication on the subject of free trade from Paisley (for a short letter from &quot;A Well-wisher&quot; at my thanks are yet more due). But the Scottish writer will, I fear, be disagreeably surprised to hear, that I am, and always have been, an utterly fearless and unscrupulous free-trader. Seven years ago, speaking of the various signs of infancy in the European mind (Stones of Venice, vol. iii. p. 168), I wrote: &quot;The first principles of commerce were acknowledged by the English parliament only a few months ago, in its free-trade measures, and are still so little understood by
the million, that no nation dares to abolish its custom-houses.&quot;

It will be observed that I do not admit even the idea of reciprocity. Let other nations, if they like, keep their ports shut; every wise nation will throw its own open. It is not the opening them, but a sudden, inconsiderate, and blunderingly experimental manner of opening them, which does the harm. If you have been protecting a manufacture for a long series of years, you must not take the protection off in a moment, so as to throw every one of its operatives at once out of employ, any more than you must take all its wrappings off a feeble child at once in cold weather, though the cumber of them may have been radically injuring its health. Little by little, you must restore it to
freedom and to air.

Most people's minds are in curious confusion on the subject of free trade, because they suppose it to imply enlarged competition. On the contrary, free trade puts an end to all competition. &quot;Protection&quot; (among various other mischievous functions,) endeavours to enable one country to compete with another in the production of an article at a disadvantage. When trade is entirely free, no country can be competed with in the articles for the production of which it is naturally calculated; nor can it compete with any other, in the production of articles for which it is not naturally calculated. Tuscany, for instance, cannot compete with England in steel, nor England with Tuscany in oil. They must exchange their steel and oil. Which exchange should be as frank and free as honesty and the sea-winds can make it. Competition, indeed, arises at first, and sharply, in order to prove which is strongest in any given manufacture possible to
both; this point once ascertained, competition is at an end. 

13. I should be glad if the reader would first clear the ground for himself so far as to determine whether the difficulty lies in getting the work or getting the pay for it. Does he consider occupation itself to be an expensive luxury, difficult of attainment, of which too little is to be found in the world? or is it rather that, while in the enjoyment even of the most athletic delight, men must nevertheless be maintained, and this maintenance is not always forthcoming? We must be clear on this head before going farther, as most people are loosely in the habit of talking of the difficulty of &quot;finding employment.&quot; Is it employment that we want to find, or support during employment? Is it idleness we wish to put an end to, or hunger? We have to take up both questions in succession, only not both at the same time. No doubt that work is a luxury, and a very great one. It is, indeed, at once a luxury and a necessity; no man can retain either health of mind or body without it. So profoundly do I feel this, that, as will be seen in the sequel, one of the principal objects I would recommend to benevolent and practical persons, is to induce rich people to seek for a larger quantity of this luxury than they at present possess. Nevertheless, it appears by experience that even this healthiest of pleasures may be indulged in to excess, and that human beings are just as liable to surfeit of labour as to surfeit of meat; so that, as on the one hand, it may be charitable to provide, for some people, lighter dinner, and more work, for others, it may be equally expedient to provide
lighter work, and more dinner. 

14. Book I. chap. iv. s. 1. To save space, my future references to Mr Mill's work will be by numerals only, as in this instance, I. iv. I. Ed. in 2 vols. 8vo. Parker, 1848.

15. If Mr Mill had wished to show the difference in result between consumption and sale, he should have represented the hardware merchant as consuming his own goods instead of selling them; similarly, the silver merchant as consuming his own goods instead of welling them. Had he done this, he would have made his position clearer, though less tenable; and perhaps this was the position he really intended to take, tacitly involving his theory, elsewhere stated, and shown in the sequel of this paper to be false, that demand for commodities is not demand for labour. But by the most diligent scrutiny of the paragraph now under examination, I cannot determine whether it is a fallacy pure and simple, or the half of one fallacy supported by the whole of a greater one; so that I treat it here on the kinder
assumption that it is one fallacy only. 

16. I take Mr Helps' estimate in his essay on War.

17. Also when the wrought silver vases of Spain were dashed to fragments by our custom-house officers, because bullion might be imported free of duty, but not brains, was the axe that broke them productive? -- the artist who wrought them unproductive? Or again. If the woodman's axe is productive, is the executioner's? as also, if the hemp of a cable be productive, does not the productiveness of hemp in a halter depend on its moral more than on its material application? 

18. Filigree: that is to say, generally, ornament dependent on
complexity, not on art. 

19. These statements sound crude in their brevity; but will be found of the utmost importance when they are developed. Thus, in the above instance, economists have never perceived that disposition to buy is a wholly moral element in demand: that is to say, when you give a man half-a-crown, it depends on his disposition whether he is rich or poor with it -- whether he will buy disease, ruin, and hatred, or buy health, advancement, and domestic love. And thus the agreeableness or exchange value of every offered commodity depends on production, not merely of the commodity, but of buyers of it; therefore on the education of buyers, and on all the moral elements by which their disposition to buy this, or that, is formed. I will illustrate and expand into final consequences every one of these definitions in its place: at present they can only be given with extremest brevity; for in order to put the subject at once in a connected form before the reader, I have thrown into one, the opening definitions of four chapters; namely, of that on Value (&quot;Ad Valorem&quot;); on Price (&quot;Thirty Pieces&quot;); on Production (&quot;Demeter&quot;);
and on Economy (&quot;The Law of the House&quot;). 

20. Perhaps it may be said, in farther support of Mr Ricardo, that he meant, &quot;when the utility is constant or given, the price varies as the quantity of labour.&quot; If he meant this, he should have said it; but, had he meant it, he could have hardly missed the necessary result, that utility would be one measure of price (which he expressly denies it to be); and that, to prove saleableness, he had to prove a given quantity of utility, as well as a given quantity of labour: to wit, in his own instance, that the deer and fish would each feed the same number of men, for the same number of days, with equal pleasure to their palates. The fact is, he did not know what he meant himself. The general idea which he had derived from commercial experience, without being able to analyze it, was, that when the demand is constant, the price varies as the quantity of labour required for production; or, -- using the formula I gave in last paper -- when y is constant, x y varies as x. But demand never is, nor can be, ultimately constant, if x varies distinctly; for, as price rises, consumers fall away; and as soon as there is a monopoly (and all scarcity is a form of monopoly; so that every commodity is affected occasionally by some colour of monopoly), y becomes the most influential condition of the price. Thus the price of a painting depends less on its merits than on the interest taken in it by the public; the price of singing less on the labour of the singer than the number of persons who desire to hear him; and the price of gold less on the scarcity which affects it in common with cerium or iridium, than on the sunlight colour and unalterable purity by which it attracts the admiration and
answers the trust of mankind. 

It must be kept in mind, however, that I use the word &quot;demand&quot; in a somewhat different sense from economists usually. They mean by it &quot;the quantity of a thing sold.&quot; I mean by it &quot;the force of the buyer's capable intention to buy.&quot; In good English, a person's &quot;demand&quot; signifies, not what he gets, but what he asks for.

Economists also do not notice that objects are not valued by absolute bulk or weight, but by such bulk and weight as is necessary to bring them into use. They say, for instance, that water bears no price in the market. It is true that a cupful does not, but a lake does; just as a handful of dust does not, but an acre does. And were it possible to make even the possession of the cupful or handful permanent, (i.e. to find a place for them,)
the earth and sea would be bought up for handfuls and cupfuls.

21. Compare George Herbert, The Church Porch, Staza 28.

22. &quot;O Zeus dipou penetai&quot; -- Arist. Plut. 582. It would but weaken the grad words to lean on the preceding ones: -- &quot;Oti tou
Platon parecho Beltionas, andpas, kai tin gnomen, kai ten idean.&quot;

23. Zech. v. ii.

24. Labour which is entirely good of its kind, that is to say, effective, or efficient, the Greeks called &quot;weighable,&quot; or axios, translated usually &quot;worthy,&quot; and because thus substantial and true, they called its price time, the &quot;honourable estimate&quot; of it (honorarium): this word being founded on their conception of true labour as a divine thing, to be honoured with the kind of honour given to the gods; whereas the price of false labour, or of that which led away from life, was to be, not honour, but vengeance; for which they reserved another word, attributing the exaction of such price to a peculiar goddess, called Tisiphone, the &quot;requiter (or quittance-taker) of death&quot;; a person versed in the highest branches of arithmetic, and punctual in her habits; with whom
accounts current have been opened also in modern days. 

25. The most accurately nugatory labour is, perhaps, that of which not enough is given to answer a purpose effectually, and which, therefore, has all to be done over again. Also, labour which fails of effect through non-co-operation. The cure of a little village near Bellinzona, to whom I had expressed wonder that the peasants allowed the Ticino to flood their fields, told me that they would not join to build an effectual embankment high up the valley, because everybody said &quot;that would help his neighbours as much as himself.&quot; So every proprietor built a bit of low embankment about his own field; and the Ticino, as soon as
it had a mind, swept away and swallowed all up together. 

26. Observe, I say,  rearing,&quot; not &quot;begetting.&quot; The praise is in the seventh season, not in sporitos, nor in phutalia, but in opora. It is strange that men always praise enthusiastically any person who, by a momentary exertion, saves a life; but praise very hesitatingly a person who, by exertion and self-denial prolonged through years, creates one. We give the crown &quot;ob civem servatum&quot;; -- why not &quot;ob civem natum?&quot; Born, I mean, to the full, in soul as well as body. England has oak enough, I think,
for both chaplets. 

27. When Mr Mill speaks of productive consumption, he only means consumption which results in increase of capital, or material wealth. See I. iii. 4, and I. iii. 5. 

28. So also in the vision of the women bearing the ephah, before quoted, &quot;the wind was in their wings,&quot; not wings &quot;of a stork,&quot; as in our version; but &quot;miivi,&quot; of a kite, in the Vulgate, or perhaps more accurately still in the Septuagint, &quot;hoopoe,&quot; a bird connected typically with the power of riches by many traditions, of which that of its petition for a crest of gold is perhaps the most interesting. The &quot;Birds&quot; of Aristophanes, in which its part is principal, are full of them; note especially the &quot;fortification of the air with baked bricks, like Babylon,&quot; I. 550; and, again, compare the Plutus of Dante, who (to show the influence of riches in destroying the reason) is the only one of the powers of the Inferno who cannot speak intelligibly and also the cowardliest; he is not merely quelled or restrained, but literally &quot;collapses&quot; at a word; the sudden and helpless operation of mercantile panic being all told in the brief metaphor, &quot;as the sails, swollen with the wind, fall, when the
mast breaks.&quot;

29. The value of raw material, which has, indeed, to be deducted from the price of the labour, is not contemplated in the passages referred to, Mr. Mill having fallen into the mistake solely by pursuing the collateral results of the payment of wages to middlemen. He says&quot; The consumer does not, with his own funds, pay the weaver for his day's work. &quot;Pardon me; the consumer of the velvet pays the weaver with his own funds as much as he pays the gardener. He pays, probably, an intermediate ship-owner, velvet merchant, and shopman; pays carriage money, shop rent, damage money, time money, and care money; all these are above and beside the velvet price, (just as the wages of a head gardener would be above the grass price). but the velvet is as much produced by the consumer's capital, though he does not pay for it till six months after production, as the grass is produced by his capital, though he does not pay the man who mowed and rolled it on Monday, till Saturday afternoon. I do not know if Mr. Mill's conclusion, -- &quot;the capital cannot be dispensed with, the purchasers can &quot; (p. 98), has yet been reduced to practice in the
City on any large scale. 

30. Which, observe, is the precise opposite of the one under examination. The hardware theory required us to discharge our gardeners and engage manufacturers; the velvet theory requires us
to discharge our manufacturers and engage gardeners. 

31. It is one very awful form of the operation of wealth in Europe that it is entirely capitalists' wealth which supports unjust wars. Just wars do not need so much money to support them; for most of the men who wage such, wage them gratis; but for an unjust war, men's bodies and souls have both to be bought; and the best tools of war for them besides; which makes such war costly to the maximum; not to speak of the cost of base fear, and angry suspicion, between nations which have not grace nor honesty enough in all their multitudes to buy an hour's peace of mind with: as, at present, France and England, purchasing of each other ten millions sterling worth of consternation annually, (a remarkably light crop, half thorns and half aspen leaves, --sown, reaped, and granaried by the &quot;science&quot; of the modern political economist, teaching covetousness instead of truth.) And all unjust war being supportable, if not by pillage of the enemy, only by loans from capitalists, these loans are repaid by subsequent taxation of the people, who appear to have no will in the matter, the capitalists' will being the primary root of the war; but its real root is the covetousness of the whole nation, rendering it incapable of faith, frankness, or justice, and bringing about, therefore, in due time, his own separate loss and
punishment to each person. 

32. &quot;In all reasoning about prices, the proviso must be understood, 'supposing all parties to take care of their own interest.'&quot; -- Mill, III. i. 5. 

33. James v. 4. Observe, in these statements I am not talking up, nor countenancing one whit, the common socialist idea of division of property; division of property is its destruction; and with it the destruction of all hope, all industry, and all justice: it is simply chaos a chaos towards which the believers in modern political economy are fast tending, and from which I am striving to save them. The rich man does not keep back meat from the poor by retaining his riches; but by basely using them. Riches are a form of strength; and a strong man does not injure others by keeping his strength, but by using it injuriously. The socialist, seeing a strong man oppress a weak one, cries out. -- &quot;Break the strong man's arms.&quot; but I say, &quot;Teach him to use them to better purpose.&quot; The fortitude and intelligence which acquire riches are intended, by the Giver of both, not to scatter, nor to give away, but to employ those riches in the service of mankind; in other words, in the redemption of the erring and aid of the weak --that is to say, there is first to be the work to gain money; then the Sabbath of use for it -- the Sabbath, whose law is, not to lose life, but to save. It is continually the fault or the folly of the poor that they are poor, as it is usually a child's fault if it falls into a pond, and a cripple's weakness that slips at a crossing; nevertheless, most passers -- by would pull the child out, or help up the cripple. Put it at the worst, that all the poor of the world are but disobedient children, or careless cripples, and that all rich people are wise and strong, and you will see at once that neither is the socialist right in desiring to make everybody poor, powerless, and foolish as he is himself,
nor the rich man right in leaving the children in the mire. 

34. The quantity of life is the same in both cases; but it is
differently allotted.

35. The proper offices of middle-men, namely, overseers (or authoritative workmen), conveyancers (merchants, sailors, retail dealers, &amp;c.), and order-takers (persons employed to receive directions from the consumer), must, of course, be examined before I can enter farther into the question of just payment of the first producer. But I have not spoken of them in these introductory papers, because the evils attendant on the abuse of such intermediate functions result not from any alleged principle of modern political economy, but from private carelessness or iniquity.

I have received your letter and two numbers of your periodical, both of which interest me extremely. The oppression of a majority by a minority, and the demoralization inevitably resulting from it, is a phenomenon that has always occupied me and has done so most particularly of late. I will try to explain to you what I think about that subject in general, and particularly about the cause from which the dreadful evils of which you write in your letter, and in the Hindu periodical you have sent me, have arisen and continue to arise.

The reason for the astonishing fact that a majority of working people submit to a handful of idlers who control their labour and their very lives is always and everywhere the same - whether the oppressors and oppressed are of one race or whether, as in India and elsewhere, the oppressors are of a different nation.

This phenomenon seems particularly strange in India, for there more than two hundred million people, highly gifted both physically and mentally, find themselves in the power of a small group of people quite alien to them in thought, and immeasurably inferior to them in religious morality.

From your letter and the articles in Free Hindustan as well as from the very interesting writings of the Hindu Swami Vivekananda and others, it appears that, as is the case in our time with the ills of all nations, the reason lies in the lack of a reasonable religious teaching which by explaining the meaning of life would supply a supreme law for the guidance of conduct and would replace the more than dubious precepts of pseudo-­religion and pseudo-­science with the immoral conclusions deduced from them and commonly called &quot;civilization&quot;.

Your letter, as well as the articles in Free Hindustan and Indian political literature generally, shows that most of the leaders of public opinion among your people no longer attach any significance to the religious teachings that were and are professed by the peoples of India, and recognize no possibility of freeing the people from the oppression they endure except by adopting the irreligious and profoundly immoral social arrangements under which the English and other pseudo-­Christian nations live today.

And yet the chief if not the sole cause of the enslavement of the Indian peoples by the English lies in this very absence of a religious consciousness and of the guidance for conduct which should flow from it - a lack common in our day to all nations East and West, from Japan to England and America alike.

===II.===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;color: black;background-color: #EFEFEF;line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;O ye, who see perplexities over your heads, beneath your feet, and to the right and left of you; you will be an eternal enigma unto yourselves until ye become humble and joyful as children. Then will ye find Me, and having found Me in yourselves, you will rule over worlds, and looking out from the great world within to the little world without, you will bless everything that is, and find all is well with time and with you.
:: Krishna.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To make my thoughts clear to you I must go farther back. We do not, cannot, and I venture to say need not, know how men lived millions of years ago or even ten thousand years ago, but we do know positively that, as far back as we have any knowledge of mankind, it has always lived in special groups of families, tribes, and nations in which the majority, in the conviction that it must be so, submissively and willingly bowed to the rule of one or more persons - that is to a very small minority. Despite all varieties of circumstances and personalities these relations manifested themselves among the various peoples of whose origin we have any knowledge; and the farther back we go the more absolutely necessary did this arrangement appear, both to the rulers and the ruled, to make it possible for people to live peacefully together.

So it was everywhere. But though this external form of life existed for centuries and still exists, very early - thousands of years before our time -amid this life based on coercion, one and the same thought constantly emerged among different nations, namely, that in every individual a spiritual element is manifested that gives life to all that exists, and that this spiritual element strives to unite with everything of a like nature to itself, and attains this aim through love. This thought appeared in most various forms at different times and places, with varying completeness and clarity. It found expression in [[w:Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], [[w:Judaism|Judaism]], [[w:Mazdaism|Mazdaism]] (the teachings of Zoroaster), in [[w:Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[w:Taoism|Taoism]], [[w:Confucianism|Confucianism]], and in the writings of the Greek and Roman sages, as well as in [[w:Christianity|Christianity]] and [[w:Mohammedanism|Mohammedanism]]. The mere fact that this thought has sprung up among different nations and at different times indicates that it is inherent in human nature and contains the truth. But this truth was made known to people who considered that a community could only be kept together if some of them restrained others, and so it appeared quite irreconcilable with the existing order of society. Moreover it was at first expressed only fragmentarily, and so obscurely that though people admitted its theoretic truth they could not entirely accept it as guidance for their conduct. Then, too, the dissemination of the truth in a society based on coercion was always hindered in one and the same manner, namely, those in power, feeling that the recognition of this truth would undermine their position, consciously or sometimes unconsciously perverted it by explanations and additions quite foreign to it, and also opposed it by open violence. Thus the truth - that his life should be directed by the spiritual element which is its basis, which manifests itself as love, and which is so natural to man -this truth, in order to force a way to man's consciousness, had to struggle not merely against the obscurity with which it was expressed and the intentional and unintentional distortions surrounding it, but also against deliberate violence, which by means of persecutions and punishments sought to compel men to accept religious laws authorized by the rulers and conflicting with the truth. Such a hindrance and misrepresentation of the truth ­which had not yet achieved complete clarity - occurred everywhere: in Confucianism and Taoism, in Buddhism and in Christianity, in Mohammedanism and in your Brahmanism.

===III.===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;color: black;background-color: #EFEFEF;line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;My hand has sowed love everywhere, giving unto all that will receive. Blessings are offered unto all My children, but many times in their blindness they fail to see them. How few there are who gather the gifts which lie in profusion at their feet: how many there are, who, in wilful waywardness, turn their eyes away from them and complain with a wail that they have not that which I have given them; many of them defiantly repudiate not only My gifts, but Me also, Me, the Source of all blessings and the Author of their being.
:: Krishna&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;color: black;background-color: #EFEFEF;line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;I tarry awhile from the turmoil and strife of the world. I will beautify and quicken thy life with love and with joy, for the light of the soul is Love. Where Love is, there is contentment and peace, and where there is contentment and peace, there am I, also, in their midst.
:: Krishna&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;The aim of the sinless One consists in acting without causing sorrow to others, although he could attain to great power by ignoring their feelings.

The aim of the sinless One lies in not doing evil unto those who have done evil unto him.

If a man causes suffering even to those who hate him without any reason, he will ultimately have grief not to be overcome.

The punishment of evil doers consists in making them feel ashamed of themselves by doing them a great kindness.

Of what use is superior knowledge in the one, if he does not endeavour to relieve his neighbour's want as much as his own?

If, in the morning, a man wishes to do evil unto another, in the evening the evil will return to him.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
:: The Hindu Kural.

Thus it went on everywhere. The recognition that love represents the highest morality was nowhere denied or contradicted, but this truth was so interwoven everywhere with all kinds of falsehoods which distorted it, that finally nothing of it remained but words. It was taught that this highest morality was only applicable to private life - for home use, as it were - but that in public life all forms of violence - such as imprisonment, executions, and wars ­might be used for the protection of the majority against a minority of evildoers, though such means were diametrically opposed to any vestige of love. And though common sense indicated that if some men claim to decide who is to be subjected to violence of all kinds for the benefit of others, these men to whom violence is applied may, in turn, arrive at a similar conclusion with regard to those who have employed violence to them, and though the great religious teachers of Brahmanism, Buddhism, and above all of Christianity, foreseeing such a perversion of the law of love, have constantly drawn attention to the one invariable condition of love (namely, the enduring of injuries, insults, and violence of all kinds without resisting evil by evil) people continued -regardless of all that leads man forward - to try to unite the incompatibles: the virtue of love, and what is opposed to love, namely, the restraining of evil by violence. And such a teaching, despite its inner contradiction, was so firmly established that the very people who recognize love as a virtue accept as lawful at the same time an order of life based on violence and allowing men not merely to torture but even to kill one another.

For a long time people lived in this obvious contradiction without noticing it. But a time arrived when this contradiction became more and more evident to thinkers of various nations. And the old and simple truth that it is natural for men to help and to love one another, but not to torture and to kill one another, became ever clearer, so that fewer and fewer people were able to believe the sophistries by which the distortion of the truth had been made so plausible.

In former times the chief method of justifying the use of violence and thereby infringing the law of love was by claiming a divine right for the rulers: the Tsars, Sultans, Rajahs, Shahs, and other heads of states. But the longer humanity lived the weaker grew the belief in this peculiar, God-given right of the ruler. That belief withered in the same way and almost simultaneously in the Christian and the Brahman world, as well as in Buddhist and Confucian spheres, and in recent times it has so faded away as to prevail no longer against man's reasonable understanding and the true religious feeling. People saw more and more clearly, and now the majority see quite clearly, the senselessness and immorality of subordinating their wills to those of other people just like themselves, when they are bidden to do what is contrary not only to their interests but also to their moral sense. And so one might suppose that having lost confidence in any religious authority for a belief in the divinity of potentates of various kinds, people would try to free themselves from subjection to it. But unfortunately not only were the rulers, who were considered supernatural beings, benefited by having the peoples in subjection, but as a result of the belief in, and during the rule of, these pseudodivine beings, ever larger and larger circles of people grouped and established themselves around them, and under an appearance of governing took advantage of the people. And when the old deception of a supernatural and God-appointed authority had dwindled away these men were only concerned to devise a new one which like its predecessor should make it possible to hold the people in bondage to a limited number of rulers.

===IV.===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;color: black;background-color: #EFEFEF;line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;Children, do you want to know by what your hearts should be guided? Throw aside your longings and strivings after that which is null and void; get rid of your erroneous thoughts about happiness and wisdom, and your empty and insincere desires. Dispense with these and you will know Love.
:: Krishna&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;color: black;background-color: #EFEFEF;line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;Be not the destroyers of yourselves. Arise to your true Being, and then you will have nothing to fear.
:: Krishna&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New justifications have now appeared in place of the antiquated, obsolete, religious ones.  These new justifications are just as inadequate as the old ones, but as they are new their futility cannot immediately be recognized by the majority of men. Besides this, those who enjoy power propagate these new sophistries and support them so skilfully that they seem irrefutable even to many of those who suffer from the oppression these theories seek to justify. These new justifications are termed &quot;scientific&quot;. But by the term &quot;scientific&quot; is understood just what was formerly understood by the term &quot;religious&quot;: just as formerly everything called &quot;religious&quot; was held to be unquestionable simply because it was called religious, so now all that is called &quot;scientific&quot; is held to be unquestionable. In the present case the obsolete religious justification of violence which consisted in the recognition of the supernatural personality of the God-ordained ruler (&quot;there is no power but of God&quot;) has been superseded by the &quot;scientific&quot; justification which puts forward, first, the assertion that because the coercion of man by man has existed in all ages, it follows that such coercion must continue to exist. This assertion that people should continue to live as they have done throughout past ages rather than as their reason and conscience indicate, is what &quot;science&quot; calls &quot;the historic law&quot;. A further &quot;scientific&quot; justification lies in the statement that as among plants and wild beasts there is a constant struggle for existence which always results in the survival of the fittest, a similar struggle should be carried on among human ­beings, that is, who are gifted with intelligence and love; faculties lacking in the creatures subject to the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest. Such is the second &quot;scientific&quot; justification.

The third, most important, and unfortunately most widespread justification is, at bottom, the age-old religious one just a little altered: that in public life the suppression of some for the protection of the majority cannot be avoided - so that coercion is unavoidable however desirable reliance on love alone might be in human intercourse. The only difference in this justification by pseudo-science consists in the fact that, to the question why such and such people and not others have the right to decide against whom violence may and must be used, pseudo-science now gives a different reply to that given by religion - which declared that the right to decide was valid because it was pronounced by persons possessed of divine power. &quot;Science&quot; says that these decisions represent the will of the people, which under a constitutional form of government is supposed to find expression in all the decisions and actions of those who are at the helm at the moment.

Such are the scientific justifications of the principle of coercion. They are not merely weak but absolutely invalid, yet they are so much needed by those who occupy privileged positions that they believe in them as blindly as they formerly believed in the immaculate conception, and propagate them just as confidently. And the unfortunate majority of men bound to toil is so dazzled by the pomp with which these &quot;scientific truths&quot; are presented, that under this new influence it accepts these scientific stupidities for holy truth, just as it formerly accepted the pseudo-religious justifications; and it continues to submit to the present holders of power who are just as hard-hearted but rather more numerous than before.

===V.===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;color: black;background-color: #EFEFEF;line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;Who am I? I am that which thou hast searched for since thy baby eyes gazed wonderingly upon the world, whose horizon hides this real life from thee. I am that which in thy heart thou hast prayed for, demanded as thy birthright, although thou hast not known what it was. I am that which has lain in thy soul for hundreds and thousands of years. Sometimes I lay in thee grieving because thou didst not recognize me; sometimes I raised my head, opened my eyes, and extended my arms calling thee either tenderly and quietly, or strenuously, de­manding that thou shouldst rebel against the iron chains which bound thee to the earth.
:: Krishna&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So matters went on, and still go on, in the Christian world. But we might have hope that in the immense Brahman, Buddhist, and Confucian worlds this new scientific superstition would not establish itself, and that the Chinese, Japanese, and Hindus, once their eyes were opened to the religious fraud justifying violence, would advance directly to a recognition of the law of love inherent in humanity, and which had been so forcibly enunciated by the great Eastern teachers. But what has happened is that the scientific superstition replacing the religious one has been accepted and secured a stronger and stronger hold in the East.

In your periodical you set out as the basic principle which should guide the actions of your people the maxim that: &quot;Resistance to aggression is not simply justifiable but imperative, nonresistance hurts both Altruism and Egotism.&quot;

Love is the only way to rescue humanity from all ills, and in it you too have the only method of saving your people from enslavement. In very ancient times love was proclaimed with special strength and clearness among your people to be the religious basis of human life. Love, and forcible resistance to evil-doers, involve such a mutual contradiction as to destroy utterly the whole sense and meaning of the conception of love. And what follows? With a light heart and in the twentieth century you, an adherent of a religious people, deny their law, feeling convinced of your scientific enlightenment and your right to do so, and you repeat (do not take this amiss) the amazing stupidity indoctrinated in you by the advocates of the use of violence - the enemies of truth, the servants first of theology and then of science - your European teachers.

You say that the English have enslaved your people and hold them in subjection because the latter have not resisted resolutely enough and have not met force by force.

But the case is just the opposite. If the English have enslaved the people of India it is just because the latter recognized, and still recognize, force as the fundamental principle of the social order. In accord with that principle they submitted to their little rajahs, and on their behalf struggled against one another, fought the Europeans, the English, and are now trying to fight with them again.

A commercial company enslaved a nation comprising two hundred millions. Tell this to a man free from superstition and he will fail to grasp what these words mean. What does it mean that thirty thousand men, not athletes but rather weak and ordinary people, have subdued two hundred million vigorous, clever, capable, and freedom-loving people? Do not the figures make it clear that it is not the English who have enslaved the Indians, but the Indians who have enslaved themselves?

When the Indians complain that the English have enslaved them it is as if drunkards complained that the spirit-dealers who have settled among them have enslaved them. You tell them that they might give up drinking, but they reply that they are so accustomed to it that they cannot abstain, and that they must have alcohol to keep up their energy. Is it not the same thing with the millions of people who submit to thousands or even to hundreds, of others - of their own or other nations?

If the people of India are enslaved by violence it is only because they themselves live and have lived by violence, and do not recognize the eternal law of love inherent in humanity.

Yes, Pitiful and foolish is he who does not know the bliss of love which surrounds him and which I have given him.
:: Krishna&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As soon as men live entirely in accord with the law of love natural to their hearts and now revealed to them, which excludes all resistance by violence, and therefore hold aloof from all participation in violence - as soon as this happens, not only will hundreds be unable to enslave millions, but not even millions will be able to enslave a single individual. Do not resist the evil-doer and take no part in doing so, either in the violent deeds of the administration, in the law courts, the collection of taxes, or above all in soldiering, and no one in the world will be able to enslave you.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;color: black;background-color: #EFEFEF;line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;O ye who sit in bondage and continually seek and pant for freedom, seek only for love. Love is peace in itself and peace which gives complete satisfaction. I am the key that opens the portal to the rarely discovered land where contentment alone is found.
:: Krishna&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is now happening to the people of the East as of the West is like what happens to every individual when he passes from childhood to adolescence and from youth to manhood. He loses what had hitherto guided his life and lives without direction, not having found a new standard suitable to his age, and so he invents all sorts of occupations, cares, distractions, and stupefactions to divert his attention from the misery and senselessness of his life. Such a condition may last a long time. When an individual passes from one period of life to another a time comes when he cannot go on in senseless activity and excitement as before, but has to understand that although he has out-grown what before used to direct him, this does not mean that he must live without any reasonable guidance, but rather that he must formulate for himself an understanding of life corresponding to his age, and having elucidated it must be guided by it. And in the same way a similar time must come in the growth and development of humanity. I believe that such a time has now arrived - not in the sense that it has come in the year 1908, but that the inherent contradiction of human life has now reached an extreme degree of tension: on the one side there is the consciousness of the beneficence of the law of love, and on the other the existing order of life which has for centuries occasioned an empty, anxious, restless, and troubled mode of life, conflicting as it does with the law of love and built on the use of violence. This contradiction must be faced, and the solution will evidently not be favourable to the outlived law of violence, but to the truth which has dwelt in the hearts of men from remote antiquity: the truth that the law of love is in accord with the nature of man. But men can only recognize this truth to its full extent when they have completely freed themselves from all religious and scientific superstitions and from all the consequent misrepresentations and sophistical distortions by which its recognition has been hindered for centuries. To save a sinking ship it is necessary to throw overboard the ballast, which though it may once have been needed would now cause the ship to sink. And so it is with the scientific superstition which hides the truth of their welfare from mankind. In order that men should embrace the truth - not in the vague way they did in childhood, nor in the one-sided and perverted way presented to them by their religious and scientific teachers, but embrace it as their highest law the complete liberation of this truth from all and every superstition (both pseudo-religious and pseudo-scientific) by which it is still obscured is essential: not a partial, timid attempt, reckoning with traditions sanctified by age and with the habits of the people - not such as was effected in the religious sphere by Guru Nanak, the founder of the sect of the Sikhs, and in the Christian world by Luther, and by similar reformers in other religions -but a fundamental cleansing of religious consciousness from all ancient religious and modern scientific superstitions. If only people freed themselves from their beliefs in all kinds of Ormuzds, Brahmas, Sabbaoths, and their incarnation as Krishnas and Christs, from beliefs in Paradises and Hells, in reincarnations and resurrections, from belief in the interference of the Gods in the external affairs of the universe, and above all, if they freed themselves from belief in the infallibility of all the various Vedas, Bibles, Gospels, Tripitakas, Korans, and the like, and also freed themselves from blind belief in a variety of scientific teachings about infinitely small atoms and molecules and in all the infinitely great and infinitely remote worlds, their movements and origin, as well as from faith in the infallibility of the scientific law to which humanity is at present subjected: the historic law, the economic laws, the law of struggle and survival, and so on, ¬if people only freed themselves from this terrible accumulation of futile exercises of our lower capacities of mind and memory called the &quot;Sciences&quot;, and from the innumerable divisions of all sorts of histories, anthropologies, homiletics, bacteriologics, jurisprudences, cosmographies, strategies - their name is legion - and freed themselves from all this harmful, stupefying ballast ¬the simple law of love, natural to man, accessible to all and solving all questions and perplexities, would of itself become clear and obligatory.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;color: black;background-color: #EFEFEF;line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;Children, look at the flowers at your feet; do not trample upon them. Look at the love in your midst and do not repudiate it.
:: Krishna&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a higher reason which transcends all human minds. It is far and near. It permeates all the worlds and at the same time is infinitely higher than they.

A man who sees that all things are contained in the higher spirit cannot treat any being with contempt.

For him to whom all spiritual beings are equal to the highest there can be no room for deception or grief.

Those who are ignorant and are devoted to the religious rites only, are in a deep gloom, but those who are given up to fruitless meditations are in a still greater darkness.

Upanishads, from Vedas.

Yes, in our time all these things must be cleared away in order that mankind may escape from self-inflicted calamities that have reached an extreme intensity. Whether an Indian seeks liberation from subjection to the English, or anyone else struggles with an oppressor either of his own nationality or of another - whether it be a Negro defending himself against the North Americans; or Persians, Russians, or Turks against the Persian, Russian, or Turkish governments, or any man seeking the greatest welfare for himself and for everybody else - they do not need explanations and justifications of old religious superstitions such as have been formulated by your Vivekanandas, Baba Bharatis, and others, or in the Christian world by a number of similar interpreters and exponents of things that nobody needs; nor the innumerable scientific theories about matters not only unnecessary but for the most part harmful. (In the spiritual realm nothing is indifferent: what is not useful is harmful.) What are wanted for the Indian as for the Englishman, the Frenchman, the German, and the Russian, are not Constitutions and Revolutions, nor all sorts of Conferences and Congresses, nor the many ingenious devices for submarine navigation and aerial navigation, nor powerful explosives, nor all sorts of conveniences to add to the enjoyment of the rich, ruling classes; nor new schools and universities with innumerable faculties of science, nor an augmentation of papers and books, nor gramophones and cinematographs, nor those childish and for the most part corrupt stupidities termed art - but one thing only is needful: the knowledge of the simple and clear truth which finds place in every soul that is not stupefied by religious and scientific superstitions -the truth that for our life one law is valid - the law of love, which brings the highest happiness to every individual as well as to all mankind. Free your minds from those overgrown, mountainous imbecilities which hinder your recognition of it, and at once the truth will emerge from amid the pseudo-religious nonsense that has been smothering it: the indubitable, eternal truth inherent in man, which is one and the same in all the great religions of the world. It will in due time emerge and make its way to general recognition, and the nonsense that has obscured it will disappear of itself, and with it will go the evil from which humanity now suffers.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em;border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;color: black;background-color: #EFEFEF;line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;Children, look upwards with your beclouded eyes, and a world full of joy and love will disclose itself to you, a rational world made by My wisdom, the only real world. Then you will know what love has done with you, what love has bestowed upon you, what love demands from you.
:: Krishna&lt;/blockquote&gt;
