'''Berlin''' is the [[capital]] city and one of the sixteen [[states of Germany|states]] of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. With a population of 3.4 million in its city limits, Berlin is the country's largest city, and the second [[Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|most populous city]] in the [[European Union]]. Located in northeastern Germany it is the center of the Berlin-[[Brandenburg]] [[Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union|metropolitan area]] comprising 4.9 million people from over 180 nations.<ref name=LUZ>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1996,45323734&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&screen=welcomeref&open=/&product=EU_MASTER_urban_audit&depth=2 Indicators for larger urban zones 1999 - 2003], Eurostat.

==History==
{{main|History of Berlin}}
[[Image:Fryderyk 2.jpg|thumb|left|140px| [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] was an [[enlightened absolutism|enlightened]] Prussian King]] 

The name ''Berlin'', which is [[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|/bə(r)ˈlɪn/}} in [[English language|English]] and {{Audio-IPA|de-Berlin.ogg|/bɛɐˈliːn/}} in [[German language|German]], is of unknown origin, but may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' "swamp".<ref>Berger,Dieter. ''Geographische Namen in Deutschland'', Bibliographisches Institut, 1999. ISBN 3-411-06252-5</ref>

The first written mention of towns in the area of present-day Berlin dates from the late 12th and early 13th century. The [[suburb]] of [[Spandau]] is first mentioned in 1197, and [[Köpenick]] in 1209, though these areas did not join Berlin until 1920. The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns: [[Cölln]] (on the [[Museum Island|Fisher Island]]) is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin (across the Spree in what is now called the [[Nikolaiviertel]]) in one from 1244. From the beginning, the two cities formed an economic and social unit. In 1307, the two cities were united politically. Over time, the twin cities came to be known simply as Berlin, the larger of the pair.

In 1415 [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Elector of Brandenburg|Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440. His successor, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II]], established Berlin as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of [[Prussia]], and finally as German emperors. In 1448 citizens rebelled in the “Berlin Indignation” against the construction of a new royal palace by Elector [[Frederick II, Margrave of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]]. This protest was not successful, however, and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. In 1451 Berlin became the royal residence of the Brandenburg electors, and Berlin had to give up its status as a free [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city. In 1539 the electors and the city officially became [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]].

=== 17th–19th century ===
[[Image:Reichsgruendung2.jpg|thumb|190px|Berlin became the capital of the [[German Empire]]  in 1871 after its proclamation in Versailles-France ([[Bismarck]] at the center in white)]]

The [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648 had devastating consequences for Berlin. A third of the houses were damaged and the city lost half of its population. [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], known as the “Great Elector”, who had succeeded his father [[George William of Brandenburg|George William]] as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting [[immigration]] and [[religious toleration|religious tolerance]]. With the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in 1685, Frederick William offered [[right of asylum|asylum]] to the French [[Huguenot]]s. More than 15,000 Huguenots went to Brandenburg, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1700, approximately twenty percent of Berlin's residents were French, and their cultural influence on the city was immense. Many other immigrants came from [[Bohemia]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], and [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]].

With the coronation of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] in 1701 as king, Berlin became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. In 1740 Friedrich II, known as [[Frederick the Great]] (1740-1786) came to power. Berlin became, under the rule of the philosophically-oriented Frederick II, a center of [[the Enlightenment]]. Following [[First French Empire|France's]] victory in the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main rail hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, outlying suburbs including [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Moabit]], and several others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded [[German Empire]].

=== 20th century ===
[[Image:Reichstag flag.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Red Army]] soldiers are raising the Soviet flag on the roof of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]]. Photo is taken May 2, [[1945]]]]

[[Image:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The [[Berlin Wall]] in 1986, painted on the western side. People crossing the so-called death strip on the eastern side were at risk of being shot]]

At the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, the [[Weimar Republic]] was proclaimed in Berlin. In [[1920]], the [[Greater Berlin Act]] united dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into a greatly expanded city and established Berlin as a separate administrative region. After this expansion, Berlin had a population of around four million. [[1920s Berlin]] was an exciting city known for its liberal subcultures, including [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[prostitution]] and well known for its fierce political street fights. This is portrayed in the 1972 film [[Cabaret (film)|Cabaret]], set in 1931.

[[German election, 1933|After the 1933 elections]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] came to power in 1933. Nazi rule destroyed Berlin's Jewish community, which numbered 170,000 before the Nazis came to power. After the pogrom of [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, thousands of the city's German Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] or, in early 1943, were shipped to death camps, such as [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Hitler had planned to rebuild Berlin on a massive scale, renaming it "[[Welthauptstadt Germania]]"; apart from the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]], however, the plan never got off the ground because of the war. During the war, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. After the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] in 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the Western Allies (the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]]) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].<ref>[http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297c01.html Agreement to divide Berlin], FDR-Library, Accessed October 20, 2006</ref>

All four allies retained shared responsibility for Berlin. However, the growing political differences between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union led the latter, which controlled the territory surrounding Berlin, to impose the [[Berlin Blockade]], an economic blockade of West Berlin.  The allies  successfully overcame the Blockade by airlifting food and other supplies into the city from [[24 June]] [[1948]] to [[11 May]] [[1949]].<ref>[http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade Berlin Airlift / Blockade], Western Allies Berlin, Accessed October 20, 2006</ref> In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and consisted of the American, British and French zones but excluded those 3 country's zone of Berlin, while the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in [[East Germany]].  West Berlin remained a free city that was separate from the Federal Republic of Germany.  West Berlin issued their own postage stamps.  Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British, and French airlines.  Lufthansa and other German airlines were prohibited from flying to West Berlin.

[[Image:62411752 8021f8180a.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Former [[Checkpoint Charlie]]]]

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory. East Germany, however, proclaimed East Berlin (which it described only as "Berlin") as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the western powers. Although half the size and population of West Berlin, it included most of the historic center. The tensions between east and west culminated in the construction of [[Berlin Wall]] between East and West Berlin and other barriers around West Berlin by East Germany on [[13 August]] [[1961]] and were exacerbated by a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] on [[27 October]] [[1961]]. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.

[[Image:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|190px|The Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989]]

Berlin was completely separated. It was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other only through strictly controlled checkpoints. For most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes. 

In 1989, pressure from the East German population brought a transition to a market-based economy in East Germany, and its citizens gained free access across the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, which was subsequently mostly demolished. Not much is left of it today; the [[East Side Gallery]] in [[Friedrichshain]] near the ''Oberbaumbrücke''  over the [[Spree]] preserves a portion of the Wall. 
On 3 October 1990 the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin became the German capital according to the unification treaty. In 1999, the [[Bundestag|German parliament]] and government began their work in Berlin.

==Geography==
[[Image:Berlin Mitte Luftansicht.jpg|thumb|190px|View over [[Mitte|Central Berlin]]]]

Berlin is located in eastern Germany, about 70 [[kilometer]]s (44&nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]) west of the border with [[Poland]] in an area with marshy terrain. Berlin's landscape was shaped by [[ice sheet]]s during the last [[ice age]]. The city center lies along the river [[Spree]] in the Berlin-Warsaw ''Urstromtal'' (ancient river valley), formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. The ''Urstromtal'' lies between the low Barnim plateau to the north, and the Teltow [[plateau]] to the south. In [[Spandau]], Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree meets the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and [[Wannsee|Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.<ref>[http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k&hl=en Satellite Image Berlin], Google Maps, Accessed October 20, 2006</ref>

[[Image:Berlin.svg|thumb|left|180px|Natural and built environment]]

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim plateau, while most of the boroughs [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow plateau. The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin ''Urstromtal'' and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the [[Teufelsberg]] in the borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf and the Müggelberge in the borough of [[Treptow-Köpenick]]. Both hills have an elevation of about 115 [[meter]]s (377&nbsp;[[Foot (unit)|ft]]). The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial pile of rubble from the ruins of [[World War II]].

===Climate===
[[Image:Potsdam view from above.jpg|thumb|190px|The hinterland of Berlin is covered with woodlands and numerous lakes ([[Havel]] river near [[Potsdam]])]]
Berlin has a [[temperate]]/mesothermal climate (Cfb) according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system. The mean annual temperature for Berlin-Dahlem (a location within [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]]) is 9.4 [[Celsius|°C]] (48.9 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) and its mean annual [[precipitation]] totals 578 millimeters (22.8&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]). The warmest months are June, July, and August, with mean temperatures of 16.7 to 17.9 °C (62.1 to 64.2 °F). The coldest are December, January, and February, with mean temperatures of −0.4 to 1.2 °C (31.3 to 34.2 °F).<ref name=worldweather>[http://www.worldweather.org/016/c00059.htm Climate figures], World Weather Information Service, Accessed October 20, 2006</ref> Berlin's built-up area creates a [[microclimate]], with heat stored by the city's buildings. Temperatures can be 4 °C (7.2 °F) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.

==Cityscape==
[[Image:Berlin Mitte by night.JPG|thumb|right|190px|Berlin along the [[Spree]] river and the [[Fernsehturm|TV tower]] by night]]

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the [[20th century]]. Each of the national governments based in Berlin—the 1871 [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[East Germany]], and now the reunified [[Germany]]—initiated ambitious construction programs, each with its own distinctive character. Berlin was devastated by bombing raids during [[World War II]] and many of the old buildings that escaped the bombs were eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s in both West and East. Much of this destruction was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Berlin's unique recent history has left the city with an eclectic array of architecture and sights.

In the eastern part, many ''[[Plattenbau]]ten'' can be found, reminders of [[Eastern Bloc]] ambitions to create complete residential areas with fixed ratios of shops, kindergartens and schools. Another difference between former east and west is in the design of little red and green men on pedestrian crossing lights ([[Ampelmännchen]] in German); the eastern versions received an opt-out during the standardization of road traffic signs after reunification. The eastern Ampelmännchen design is now used in the western part of the city as well.

===Architecture===
[[Image:Berlin - Haus des Lehrers & BCC.jpg|thumb|right|190px|House of teacher & Berlin Congress Center at [[Alexanderplatz]]]]

The [[Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is the second highest building in the European Union at {{m to ft|368|precision=0}}.  Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its 204&nbsp;meter (669&nbsp;ft) high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism Style of the [[Stalin]] era. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (Red City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. The previously built-up part in front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen (Berlin)|Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological scene.

The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the [[Berlin Wall]]. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.  It has recently undergone a restoration.

[[Image:Berlin Brandenburger Tor 20040917.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The [[Brandenburg Gate]]]]

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and [[Germany]]. It also appears on German [[euro]] coins (10 Cent / 20 Cent and 50 Cent). The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German [[Bundestag|Parliament]], renovated in the 1950s after severe World War II damage. The building was again remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city. 

[[Gendarmenmarkt]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin whose name dates back to the Napoleonic occupation of Berlin, is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom|French Cathedral]] with its observation platform and the German Cathedral. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

[[Image:Potsdamerplatzberlin.JPG|190px|thumb|right|[[Potsdamer Platz]] at dusk]]

The [[Berliner Dom]], a Protestant cathedral and the third church on this site, is located on the [[Museum Island|Spree Island]] across from the site of the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]]. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier [[Prussia]]n royal family. Like many other buildings, it suffered extensive damage during World War II.  The [[Cathedral of St. Hedwig]] is Berlin's [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] cathedral.

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and [[Ernst Reuter|Ernst-Reuter-Platz]], serves as central East-West-Axis. Its name commemorates the uprisings in [[East Berlin]] of [[17 June]] [[1953]]. Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938&ndash;39 from its previous position in front of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]].

===City state===
[[Image:Klaus-wowereit.jpg|130px|thumb|left|Governing Mayor [[Klaus Wowereit]] (right)]]
The city and state [[parliament]] is the House of Representatives (''Abgeordnetenhaus''), which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's [[executive (government)|executive]] body is the [[Senate]] of Berlin (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate of Berlin consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the official title "Mayor" (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[Left Party (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].<ref>[http://www.statistik-berlin.de/wahlen/ Berlin state election, 2006]/(German), Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin, Accessed November 12, 2006</ref>

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously lord mayor of the city (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and prime minister of the federal state (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of Berlin's governing mayor is in the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (Red City Hall). Since 2001 this office has been held by [[Klaus Wowereit]] of the SPD .<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/050516/wowereit.html The Glamor Guy], Time Europe, Accessed October 20, 2006 .</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/world/europe/23wowereit.html?ex=1161489600&en=2129daf9965bf613&ei=5070 Berlin Mayor, Symbol of Openness, Has National Appeal], New York Times, Accessed October 20, 2006.</ref> The city's government is based on a coalition between the SPD and Die Linke.

===Boroughs===
[[Image:BerlinDistricts.svg|thumb|right|190px| Map of Berlin's twelve boroughs and their localities]]

Berlin is subdivided into [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|twelve boroughs]] (''Bezirke''), but before [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] there were 23. Each borough is subdivided into a number of localities (''Ortsteile''), which represent the traditional [[urbanization|urbanized]] areas that inhabitants identify with. Some of these have been rearranged several times over the years. At present the city of Berlin consists of 95 such localities. The localities often consist of a number of city neighborhoods (usually called ''[[Kiez]]'' in the Berlin dialect) representing small residential areas.

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') and a borough mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The borough council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities. <!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the Council of Mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), led by the city's Governing Mayor, which advises the Senate.

The localities have no government bodies of their own, even though most of the localities have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on [[1 October]] [[1920]]. The subsequent position of locality representative (''Ortsvorsteher'') was discontinued in favor of borough mayors.

===Sister cities ===
[[Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with [[Los Angeles]] in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level.<ref>[http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/staedteverbindungen/index_en.html Sister cities of Berlin], www.berlin.de, Accessed November 7, 2006</ref> During the [[Cold War]] era, the partnerships had reflected the different powers blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.
There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in events organized by international city associations such as Union of the Capitals of the [[European Union]], Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, Conference of the World's Capital Cities.

==Demographics==
[[Image:PeopleBerlin.jpg|thumb|190px|right|People in [[Kreuzberg]]]]

Berlin is a center for national and international [[immigration]] since the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in 1685.
The Edict guaranteed religious freedom and a tax-free status to French Calvinists for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in [[1920]] incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 [[square kilometer]]s (25.5&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) to 883 square kilometers (341&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and the population from 1.9 million to 4 million. Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin have initiated waves of immigrants in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]]. In the [[1990s]] the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' made immigration from the former [[Soviet Union]] possible. The current decade experiences a continual increasing influx from various western countries and especially young EU-Europeans are settling in the city.

The largest religious groupings are  [[Irreligion|No religion]] 60%, [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] 23% (757,000), [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] 9% (312,000), [[Islam|Muslim]] 6% (213,000), [[Judaism|Jewish]] 0.4% (12,000).<ref name=factsheet>{{PDFlink|[http://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/rbm-skzl/fifawm/factsheetwmenglisch.pdf Berlin fact sheet]|99.1&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 101480 bytes -->}}, www.berlin.de, Accessed October 20, 2006</ref>

===Museums, galleries===
[[Image:IshtarGateBerlin.jpg|thumb|right|188px|The [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] at [[Pergamon Museum]]]]

Berlin is home to 153 museums.<ref name=factsheet /> The ensemble on the [[Museum Island]] is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] and is situated in the northern part of the Spree Island between the Spree and the Kupfergraben.<ref name=UNESCO /> As early as 1841 it was designated a “district dedicated to art and antiquities” by a royal decree. Subsequently,  the [[Altes Museum]] (Old Museum) in the Lustgarten displaying the bust of [[Nefertiti|Queen Nefertiti]],<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=80&story_id=22752 A 3,000-year-old smile], Expatica.Com, Accessed November 1, 2006</ref> and the [[Neues Museum]] (New Museum), [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] (Old National Gallery), [[Pergamon Museum]], and [[Bode Museum]] were built there. While these buildings once housed distinct collections, the names of the buildings no longer necessarily correspond to the names of the collections they house.

Apart from the Museum Island, there is a wide variety of museums. The [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] (Painting Gallery) focuses on the paintings of the "old masters" from the 13th to the 18th centuries, while the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] (New National Gallery, built by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]) specializes in 20th-century European painting. The [[Hamburger Bahnhof]], located  in [[Moabit|Berlin-Moabit]], exhibits a major collection of modern and contemporary art. In spring 2006, the expanded [[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] re-opened in the Zeughaus with an overview of German history through the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

==Infrastructure==
[[Image:BlnHauptbahnhof28.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Berlin Hauptbahnhof|Berlin's Central Railway Station]]]]

Berlin developed a complex transportation and energy-supply infrastructure before World War II. After the war, West Berlin was cut off from the surrounding territory and had to develop independent infrastructures. Meanwhile, the government of East Germany purposely constructed rail lines and motorways that allowed traffic to bypass West Berlin. The political reunification of East and West Berlin has led to the reintegration of Berlin's transportation and energy-supply with the infrastructures of the surrounding region.
Crossing 979 bridges, {{km to mi|5334|precision=0}} of roads run through Berlin, of which {{km to mi|66|precision=0}} are motorways. In 2004, 1.428 million motor vehicles, including 6,800 [[Taxicab|taxi]]s, were registered in the city.<ref name=factsheet />Long-distance rail lines connect Berlin with all of the major cities of Germany and with many cities in neighboring European countries. Regional rail lines provide access to the surrounding region of Brandenburg and eastern Germany.

===Transport===
[[Image:S-Bahn Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]]]]

Public transport within Berlin is provided by the <!--This would probably look better in a table of some sort-->[[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] (331.5&nbsp;km [206.0&nbsp;mi] net length/ 375.8 million passengers in 2006) —operated by S-Bahn  Berlin GmbH—and by the [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] (144.2&nbsp;km [89.6&nbsp;mi] / 456.8 million passengers), [[Berlin Straßenbahn|Straßenbahn]] (187.7&nbsp;km [116.6&nbsp;mi] / 171.3 million passengers), [[Bus]] (1,626&nbsp;km [1,010&nbsp;mi] / 407.1 million passengers), and ferries—operated by the [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe]], or BVG.<ref name=statoffice /> The S-Bahn is a mostly overground urban railway system. The U-Bahn is the city's mainly underground rail system. The Straßenbahn or tram (trolley) system operates almost exclusively in the eastern part of the city. Buses provide extensive service linking outlying districts with the city center and to the U-Bahn and S-Bahn. Almost all means of public transport— U- & S- Bahn, trams, buses and most ferries—can be accessed with the same ticket.

[[Image:Ubahn oberbaum.gif|140px|right|thumb|The [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] ]]

The inner city is crossed from west to east by the elevated main line (''[[Berlin Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]]''), which carries S-Bahn trains as well as regional and long-distance trains. This main line passes through most of the city's long-distance and regional train stations, including [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]], [[Berlin Zoologischer Garten]], [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]], [[Friedrichstraße]], [[Alexanderplatz]], and [[Berlin Ostbahnhof]].<ref>[http://www.s-bahn-berlin.de/englisch/sehenswuerdig/index.htm Map S-Bahn Stadtbahn ], www.s-bahn-berlin.de, Accessed November 12, 2006</ref> 

The second component of Berlin's rail network is the S-Bahn ring (''Ringbahn'') that forms a circle around the inner city and crosses the main line at Westkreuz (“west crossing”) and [[Ostkreuz]] (“east crossing”). A number of regional and regional express lines connect Berlin with the surrounding region. The last one is the S-Bahn connection from South to North stopping at Südkreuz and Gesundbrunnen, two of the largest train stations in Berlin. The city is also served by the freight rail yard at Seddin, south of Potsdam. There <ref>[http://www.fahrinfo-berlin.de/fahrinfo/bin/query.bin/en?L=bvg&ld=bvg4&L=bvg&seqnr=1|BVG Route planner], BVG (Berlin Transport Authority), Accessed October 20, 2006</ref> or a map of the current public transport network. 

[[Image:EDDT Empfang & Tower.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Tegel International Airport]] ]]

Berlin has three commercial airports. [[Tegel International Airport]] (TXL), [[Tempelhof International Airport]] (THF), and [[Schönefeld International Airport]] (SXF), which handled a total of 18.5 million passengers in 2006 and serving 155 destinations (07/2006) - 118 of them in Europe. Schönefeld lies just outside Berlin's south-eastern border in the state of Brandenburg, while the other two airports lie within the city. Tempelhof handles shorter distance and commuter flights, and there are plans to close the airport and transfer its traffic to Schönefeld airport. There are longer-term plans to close Tegel as well. Schönefeld is currently undergoing expansion. Berlin's airport authority aims to transfer all of Berlin's air traffic in 2011 to a greatly expanded airport at Schönefeld, to be renamed [[Berlin Brandenburg International Airport]].<ref>[http://www.berlin-airport.de/bbi/rubEnglish/index.html Airport Berlin Brandenburg International], Airports Berlin, Accessed October 20, 2006</ref>

===Utilities===
[[Image:Berlin HKW Mitte.jpg|thumb|140px|Heizkraftwerk [[Mitte]]]]

Berlin's power supply is mainly provided by the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]] and is relying more heavily than other electricity producers in Germany on [[lignite]] as an energy source. Because burning lignite produces harmful emissions, Vattenfall has announced a commitment to shift towards reliance on cleaner, [[renewable energy]] sources.<ref>[http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/05/30/a0166.1/text Abgase tiefer gelegt] (German), taz, Accessed November 6, 2006</ref> During the division of Berlin, the power grid of West Berlin was cut off from the power grid of the surrounding area in [[East Germany]]. West Berlin's [[electricity]] supply was provided by thermal [[power station]]s. To facilitate buffering during load peaks, accumulators were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low [[power consumption]] and unloaded during times of high consumption. In 1993 the power connections to the surrounding areas which had been capped in 1951 were restored. In the western districts of Berlin nearly all power lines are underground cables—only a 380 kV and a 110 kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380 kV electric line]] was constructed when West Berlin's electrical system was a totally independent system and not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the whole city's power system.

===Health system===
[[Image:Charité (Berlin).jpg|thumb|180px|left|The [[Charité]] main building]]
Berlin has a long tradition as a city of medicine and medical technology. The Berlin Charité Hospital is the largest [[university hospital]] in Europe. It is a joint institution of the [[Free University of Berlin]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] including a wide range of institutes and medical competence centers. Among them are the German Heart Center, one of the most renowned and successful transplantation centers, the Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine and the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics. Scientific research is complemented by many industry research departments of companies such as Siemens, Schering or debis. The history of medicine has been widely influenced by scientists from Berlin: [[Rudolf Virchow]], the founder of cellular pathology, [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]], most famous surgeon of the first half of the 20th century or [[Robert Koch]], discoverer of the [[anthrax]] [[bacillus]], the [[tuberculosis]] bacillus and the [[cholera]] bacillus.
